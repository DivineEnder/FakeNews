"{\"title\": \"Top Diplomat Victoria Nuland Apologizes for Cursing European Union\", \"content\": \"Washington\\u2019s new top diplomat for Europe, Victoria Nuland, apologized Thursday to EU counterparts after she was caught cursing about the European response to the crisis in Ukraine in a bugged phone call.US officials, while not denying such a conversation took place, refused to go into details, and pointed the finger at Russia for allegedly bugging the diplomats\\u2019 phones.While Psaki said she had no independent details of how the conversation was captured and uploaded onto the social networking site, she added: \\u201cCertainly we think this is a new low in Russian tradecraft.\\u201dWhite House spokesman Jay Carney alleged that the fact that it had been \\u201ctweeted out by the Russian government, it says something about Russia\\u2019s role.\\u201dNuland, who took over late last year as assistant secretary for European affairs, and Pyatt appear to discuss President Viktor Yanukovych\\u2019s offer last month to make opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk the new prime minister and Vitaly Klitschko, deputy prime minister. Both men turned the offer down.Nuland, who in December went down to Independence Square in Kiev in a show of support for the demonstrators, adds she has also been told that the UN chief Ban Ki-moon is about to appoint a former Dutch ambassador to Kiev, Robert Serry, as his representative to Ukraine.Psaki sought to downplay any tensions with the European Union over Ukraine, which has been rocked by weeks of protests by pro-democracy protestors.Demonstrators were angered by Yanukovych\\u2019s sudden decision last year to abandon moves to sign an association accord with the EU, and instead solicit a financial aid package from former Soviet master, Russia.Psaki said the United States, which is mulling possible sanctions on Ukraine if it cracks down on the protests, has \\u201cbeen working closely\\u201d with the EU.She also disputed Russian allegations that Washington was meddling in Kiev\\u2019s internal politics.Nuland is heard saying of Klitschko, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think Klitsch should go into the government. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s necessary. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a good idea.\\u201dBut Psaki said it should be \\u201cno surprise that US officials talk about issues\\u201d adding it was a \\u201cprivate diplomatic conversation.\\u201dThe phone tapping was an ironic twist on a spying scandal which soured relations with the EU last year, after it was revealed that US intelligence agencies had been gathering data from European leaders\\u2019 phones.Nuland meanwhile met Thursday in Kiev with Yanukovych, who told her that he wanted to quickly adopt constitutional changes called for by pro-Western demonstrators.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 117752}"
