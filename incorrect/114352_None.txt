It is not an option not to do it,\\u201d he declared.For the first time since negotiations began, he declined to offer assurances, when asked, that default would be avoided. Moments later, however, he said he was confident of that outcome.At a news conference of his own a short while later, Boehner said, \\u201cI want to be entirely clear. No one wants default.\\u201dIn a letter circulated earlier to the House Republican rank and file, said he had withdrawn from the talks with Obama because \\u201cin the end, we couldn\\u2019t connect.\\u201dHe said the president wanted to raise taxes, and was reluctant to agree to cuts in benefit programs.The disconnect in the talks with the White House was \\u201cnot because of different personalities but because of different visions for our country,\\u201d he said, and he announced he would now seek agreement with leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate.Obama was having none of that, announcing instead a morning White House meeting where he said he expected to hear proposed solutions from the top leaders of both parties in both houses.Read the whole thing here. Unfortunately, this bears repeating; the Executive and Legislative Branches are separate, but equal branches of government. Obama cannot \\u201corder\\u201d them to do anything.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
