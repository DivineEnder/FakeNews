Ms. Harris, who has received the official backing of the StateDemocratic Party, captured 40 percent of the vote, and Ms. Sanchez 17 percent, with 55 percent of the precincts reporting.\\\",\\\"The campaign to replaceBarbara Boxer, a Democrat who was first elected in 1992, is the first for an open Senate seat in California in more than a generation.\\\",\\\"In a brief speech to a crowd of her supporters in San Francisco on Tuesday night, Ms. Harris said she was confident that she was attracting \\u201cfolks of all stripes\\u201d across the state.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOur unity is our strength and our diversity is our power,\\u201d said Ms. Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica. She added that the election in the fall would \\u201cbe about reminding people that we reject those who talk about \\u2018us versus them.\\u2019 We reject those people who speak this anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric.\\u201d\\\",\\\"So far, Ms. Harris has largely shied away from directly engaging Ms. Sanchez, but the fall election could force the candidates to show how they differ on policy.\\\",\\\"In public appearances and campaign advertisements, Ms. Harris has presented herself as \\u201csmart on crime\\u201d and has said she would work to overhaul the country\\u2019s criminal justice laws.\\\",\\\"Ms. Sanchez has relied on her experience as a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, saying she best understands how to get things done in Washington.\\\",\\\"No matter who wins in the fall, California voters will make history: electing either the Senate\\u2019s first Latina or its first black female senator since Carol Moseley Braun, an Illinois Democrat who served from 1993 to 1999.\\\",\\\"To help build a coalition, Ms. Sanchez may turn to Republican voters, who despite losses throughout the state retain significant power in her home base of Orange County. She is widely seen as the more business-friendly of the two and has also voted in favor of some legislation backed by the gun industry.\\\",\\\"But Ms. Sanchez may also rely heavily on Latino voters. Many analysts predict that Latinos, who make up nearly half of California\\u2019s population, will vote in record numbers here in the fall, drawn to the polls in large part by anti-immigrant rhetoric from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe\\u2019re just going to start working tomorrow toward November,\\u201d Ms. Sanchez told her supporters in Anaheim.\\\",\\\"Ms. Harris has received the backing of many of the state\\u2019s highest-profile Democrats, including Gov. Jerry Brown. Though she received the state party\\u2019s endorsement this spring, however, officials have not indicated what resources, if any, they will put into the race.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt would be new territory, it\\u2019s really breaking new ground,\\u201d said Michael Soller, a spokesman for the state party. \\u201cNobody really wants to think about it just yet.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Many of the state\\u2019s most generous Democratic donors have yet to give to either candidate.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
