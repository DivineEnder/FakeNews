But b careful. We can disagree with Romney & win the election without demonizing him.\\u201c\\u201cNever let a person twist you into something you are not. Match lies with truth, darkness with light, hate with love.\\u201d\\u00a0He received a tweet from another leftist that said, \\u201cFunny till 1978 his church thought you we were demons anyone care to ask him how he made the transition?\\u201dBooker responded:\\u201c& u want 2 defend Christian Church\\u2019s past sins? Come on/Lets leave his faith out of it \\u201cA third leftist chimed in:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u201cPease don\\u2019t defend romney. He isn\\u2019t fair.\\u201dBooker patiently responded:\\u201cSorry u think I was defending him. I thought I was defending civility & honorable conduct.\\u201dThen conservatives recognized that Booker was acting honorably and commended him, one writing: \\u201cCivility among the hard left is extremely rare and unwelcome. I respect you for trying to be though.\\u201dAnother wrote: \\u201cyou are very different from your liberal counterparts\\u2026almost too different. Don\\u2019t know how you do it. #comeintothelight ;)\\u201dA third echoed:\\u201cDear Mayor @CoryBooker please join the @GOP we allow people to speak #truth without condemning them. You did nothing wrong !\\u201dOf course, the Right\\u2019s warm greeting only made the Left nuts; they doubled down on their attacks, writing:\\u201c@CoryBooker @TracyBuffer Hey Cory, R U going to go on MTP again and undermine PBO again?\\u201dand: \\t\\u201c@CoryBooker to summarize, any policy that involves #magicunderwear is not going to solve our nations \\teconomic, education, or healthcare woes.\\u201dand: \\t\\u201c@CoryBooker @golfndadblogger Thy set the rules demonizing Obama & pledging to see him fail. Diebold fixed yet? Voter reg restored? Wisconsin.\\u201dLet\\u2019s not give Booker too much credit, though; he\\u2019s still blind about Obama saying: \\u201cSorry, Obama isn\\u2019t champion of debt. He\\u2019s champion of trying 2 save an economy that was driven to its knees by irresponsible economic policy.\\u201dBut at least he helped pull back the veil on the Leftists who cry about civility while eviscerating one of their own who dares to civilly disagree.\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2}"
