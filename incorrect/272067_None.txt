"{\"title\": \"Four Conservative Films Which Could Spell Doom for Obama Next Month\", \"content\": \"Stephen K. Bannon\\u2019s Citizens United documentary, \\u201cThe Hope and the Change,\\u201d follows 40 Democrats and Independents who voted for Obama in 2008 but will not vote for him again in 2012.While the interview subjects are initially \\u201ceuphoric\\u201d about electing the first black president and describe Obama with words like \\u201csavior,\\u201d \\u201ccharismatic\\u201d and \\u201cwondrous,\\u201d they quickly question their vote.They read about the auto bailout and the $787 billion \\u201cstimulus\\u201d bill and watch Obama presented with the Nobel Peace Prize for achieving nothing. They still give Obama the benefit of the doubt, but their hope is starting to fade.These voters don\\u2019t ascribe any malevolent intentions to the failures of President Obama. Instead, they simply feel he was unprepared and is still in over his head. They blame themselves and the media for not properly vetting candidate Obama four years ago.This film is available on Hulu.com and various cable outlets. It is a permission slip for every Democrat and Independent, letting them know they are not alone in their frustration and disappointment. More importantly, it tells them it\\u2019s okay not to vote for President Obama again. They\\u2019re not racist for simply realizing that he tried and failed, and it\\u2019s time to let him go.Bannon\\u2019s other Citizens United documentary, \\u201cOccupy Unmasked,\\u201d features the late Andrew Breitbart exposing what may be the most misunderstood political movement of our time, Occupy Wall Street.Along with former radicals like David Horowitz, Brandon Darby and Lee Stranahan, Breitbart dissects the origins of the actual \\u201cAstroturf\\u201d movement (to borrow from former-Speaker Nancy Pelosi).From the false rumor that the band Radiohead would be playing in New York City\\u2019s Zuccotti Park to the violence that plagued America\\u2019s cities around the Occupy encampments, everything was planned and community organized by radicals from the communist and anarchist movements in concert with the labor unions and many in the so-called \\u201cmainstream\\u201d media.\\u201cOccupy Unmasked\\u201d is also available on Hulu.com and is a must see. If you thought you knew about the Occupy movement\\u2026 You don\\u2019t. At least not until you see this film.\\u201c2016: Obama\\u2019s America,\\u201d based on Dinesh D\\u2019Souza\\u2019s book \\u201cObama\\u2019s America: Unmaking the American Dream,\\u201d examines the question, \\u201cWhat is Barack Obama\\u2019s American dream?\\u201dBy tracing Obama\\u2019s life from his birth, to his election, right up until today, D\\u2019Souza exposes that Obama\\u2019s dream is not what most of us would consider to be the \\u201cAmerican Dream\\u201d but is instead \\u2013 as the title \\u00a0indicates \\u2013 the \\u201cDreams\\u201d of his father, Barack Obama, Sr.The elder Obama was an anti-colonial socialist who fought to drive the British out of Kenya. He hated the colonial powers, Israel and capitalism.Barack, Jr. embraced his father\\u2019s ideology, in no small measure, because his mother (also a socialist) built the father he never really knew up into a heroic figure. She also made sure her son had a mentor in the person of Frank Marshall, a card-carrying member of the Communist Party.This documentary broke box office records and was just released on DVD. It\\u2019s also available on Video on Demand.Last but certainly not least is\\u00a0\\u201cAtlas Shrugged: Part II,\\u201d the second of the three-part adaptation of Ayn Rand\\u2019s classic book. This fictional, but eerily familiar, vision of a not too distant future has many elements of what is actually occurring in America right now. The federal government has enacted the \\u201cFair Share\\u201d law, which requires companies to sell only equal amounts of their products to other companies and must sell the government what it says it needs for the \\u201cpublic good\\u201d without regard for profit.There are government \\u201cczars\\u201d who speak of the Constitution being irrelevant and capitalism \\u201cnot working.\\u201d Gasoline is more than $40 a gallon, meaning that only the very rich can drive cars and airlines are only flying cross-country once a week.The only viable means of transportation are the railroads. Unemployment is out of control and the rich are vilified. As one of the business owners in the movie says, \\u201cThe government takes what it wants and taxes what\\u2019s left.\\u201d\\u201cAtlas Shrugged: Part II,\\u201d in theaters now, is a chilling vision (written in 1957) of what our country could look like after four more years of an Obama presidency.Anyone who sees at least two of these films will pause before they go to the ballot box to reelect President Obama.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 272067}"
