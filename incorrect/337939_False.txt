"{\"content\": \"{\\\"For decades, SenatorRobert Menendezhas been one of the immovable objects of New Jersey politics. Even now, staring down expected criminal charges, the Democratic lawmaker has vowed not to give way.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI am not going anywhere,\\u201d Mr. Menendez announced at a news conference in Newark on Friday, denying any wrongdoing.\\\",\\\"Democrats in New Jersey and Washington take that pledge seriously. In an increasingly diverse state, Mr. Menendez has proved to be a fierce political survivor, rising from local office to theUnited States Senatethanks to a mastery of political fund-raising and a deft grasp of coalition politics. While rumors of impropriety have swirled around him for years, they did not block his appointment to the Senate in 2005 or seriously hinder his election campaigns in 2006 and 2012.\\\",\\\"This time may be different. A law enforcement official said on Friday that Mr. Menendezwould face federal corruption chargeswithin a month, after a long investigation into his relationship with a political benefactor, Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Floridaeye surgeon. Depending on the gravity of the charges, the senator could feel considerable pressure to step down.\\\",\\\"Mr. Menendez, 61, is not the first New Jersey leader to be targeted by the Justice Department. But he is under fire at an already precarious moment for the state\\u2019s Democrats, whose roster of talent has diminished over years of machine control and expansive scandal.\\\",\\\"As New Jersey has grown steadily more Democratic, power in the party has stayed mainly with a few long-serving officials, Mr. Menendez among them. Most have left office only as a result of personal impropriety, criminal investigation or death.\\\",\\\"Former Gov.Richard J. Codey, a state senator who became acting governor in 2004 when his predecessor,James E. McGreevey,resignedamid a sex-and-blackmail scandal, said New Jersey\\u2019s Democratic organization was in \\u201ca very confused state.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis could take years to play out, and I don\\u2019t see Senator Menendez as someone who would just lay down and walk away,\\u201d Mr. Codey said, while emphasizing that he supported Mr. Menendez and viewed him as honest.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere are times when we take the \\u2018fun\\u2019 out of the \\u2018dysfunctional,\\u2019\\u00a0\\u201d Mr. Codey said of the stateDemocratic Party.\\\",\\\"When struck by disaster in recent years, Democrats have always had a replacement candidate handy.\\\",\\\"In 2002, when SenatorRobert G. Torricelliabruptly endedhis re-election bid against the backdrop of a spiraling ethics investigation, Democrats easily lured former Senator Frank R. Lautenberg out of retirement. After Mr. Lautenberg\\u2019s death in 2013, the party turned to MayorCory Bookerof Newark todefend the seat.\\\",\\\"And for nearly a decade, Democrats relied heavily onJon S. Corzine, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive who was elected to the state\\u2019s other Senate seat and, later, as governor.\\\",\\\"But the game of electoral musical chairs has done little to develop a new generation of party leaders. Ambitious lawmakers have come and gone, without a chance to move up: Former RepresentativesRush D. HoltandRobert E. Andrewsboth sought to run for Senate, only to find their paths blocked. Other Democrats missed their moment because of age or because, like former Representative Steve Rothman, they had been pushed aside in congressional redistricting.\\\",\\\"Political advancement has often come as a product of family connections: Two of the six Democrats who currently represent New Jersey in Congress are Donald W. Norcross, whose brother is George E. Norcross III, the Camden County Democratic leader, and Donald M. Payne Jr., who took over his late father\\u2019s seat in a 2012 special election.\\\",\\\"The few truly new faces to appear in recent years have been distinctive talents, powered either by vast wealth or personal charisma: Mr. Corzine and Mr. Booker, among the Democrats, and Gov.Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor, on the Republican side. With Mr. Menendez\\u2019s problems \\u201crumored for a long, long time,\\u201d former Gov.Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, suggested that an infusion of fresh talent would be welcomed.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNew blood is always good and I think the more young people these days we get involved, the better,\\u201d Mr. Kean said. \\u201cNew Jersey\\u2019s got a lot of problems right now.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Corruption has been prominent among those problems, souring the electoral environment and trapping earnest up-and-comers within a party structure that typically requires new arrivals to wait in line.\\\",\\\"Should his situation deteriorate, Mr. Menendez may join a list of top New Jersey politicians to run afoul of the law or public mores, including Mr. McGreevey and Mr. Torricelli. Mr. Corzine, after leaving office, has grappled with federal regulators over the collapse of MF Global, an investment firm he led.\\\",\\\"Mr. Christie, who defeated Mr. Corzine in 2009, is now contending with an inquiry into the closings of local lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013.\\\",\\\"Headlines have been at least as tawdry on the local level, with numerous mayors and county leaders convicted of bribery and misusing public resources.\\\",\\\"One powerful stateassemblyman went to jailfor printing child pornography in his office. A formerState Senate president was jailedfor corruption, and themayor of Hobokenadmitted taking bribes after he was arrested in a massive sting that also rolled up an organ-trafficking scheme, to name a few of the more sensational cases.\\\",\\\"State SenatorRaymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat who has considered seeking higher office, said it was \\u201ctoo soon to tell\\u201d what would happen with Mr. Menendez\\u2019s seat.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a good time for the state, that\\u2019s for sure,\\u201d Mr. Lesniak said. \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t had a lot of good news lately. Even the weather hasn\\u2019t been good.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In the event Mr. Menendez does leave office, the task of choosing a replacement would fall to Mr. Christie. Based on the timing of a vacancy, his appointee \\u2014 presumably a Republican \\u2014 would serve until either an election in November or the regularly scheduled federal elections in 2016. Or, if the governor decided, until a special election at another time.\\\",\\\"The ranks in both parties have been so depleted, party leaders said, that the list of candidates for a possible election starts \\u2014 and nearly ends \\u2014 with officials who have run and lost in the past.\\\",\\\"Democrats, who asked to speak anonymously to avoid angering Mr. Menendez, said their choices include Mr. Holt and RepresentativeFrank J. Pallone Jr., who both ran unsuccessfully for the Senate seat now held by Mr. Booker.\\\",\\\"But Mr. Pallone recently claimed a coveted post on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Asked on Friday about his interest in another Senate race, Mr. Holt replied: \\u201cMy comment would be, what vacancy?\\u201d\\\",\\\"Also mentioned was Mr. Codey, the former acting governor. One or two of the Democrats considering a bid for governor in 2017 might also opt to run sooner.\\\",\\\"Among Republicans, potential contenders could include State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr., who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Menendez in 2006, and State Senator Joe Kyrillos, who ran against him in 2012. In their campaigns, both men challenged Mr. Menendez\\u2019s ethics: Mr. Kean focused on his real estate dealings; Mr. Kyrillos raised the specter of the Melgen investigation in its early stages.\\\",\\\"Republicans also see Jon M. Bramnick, the party\\u2019s leader in the State Assembly, and Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli as potential candidates. Both men declined to comment on the possibility.\\\",\\\"Yet there is no obvious outside contender for Mr. Menendez\\u2019s seat, someone who might, like few others, overcome New Jersey\\u2019s political inertia.\\\",\\\"Mr. Menendez himself was once such a candidate. More than three decades ago, the man now ensnared in a federal investigation made his name as a crusader against corruption, testifying against his political mentor,William V. Musto, Union City\\u2019s mayor, in a fraud trial that led to Mr. Musto\\u2019s downfall.\\\",\\\"James Plaisted, one of the prosecutors in that case, recalled that, at the time, Mr. Menendez was \\u201can extraordinarily principled, idealistic young man.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe was bucking the establishment in his town, trying to do the right thing,\\u201d Mr. Plaisted said, adding: \\u201cI feel very disappointed.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 337939, \"title\": \"With Case Hanging Over Menendez, Democrats Lack a Clear Successor \", \"source_id\": 22236}"
