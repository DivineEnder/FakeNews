"{\"title\": \"Obama faces gay rights challenge in Kenya\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 33373, \"content\": \"Six and a half years after Kenyans started naming their children in honor of America\\u2019s first black president, Barack Obama\\u2019s name has also become synonymous, often derisively, with gay rights.\\u201cGo wait for your Obama,\\u201d a landlord reportedly told a gay couple as he kicked them out of their Nairobi apartment, part of an apparent uptick in homophobic acts in the country ahead of the American president\\u2019s visit.During Obama\\u2019s presidency, the United States has generally become more supportive of gay rights including same-sex marriage, while Africa has moved the other direction. In 2014 alone, Nigeria, Gambia and Uganda enacted new laws to impose long prison sentences for same-sex relationships. In most African countries \\u2014 including Kenya, where Obama arrives for a visit on Friday \\u2014 homosexuality remains illegal and gays and lesbians are ostracized or worse.Some African leaders have warned Obama not to raise the issue of gay rights during his trip. That puts Obama in a tough spot: His administration has made promoting LGBT tolerance a key goal of his foreign policy, but pushing too hard could backfire in countries where anti-gay rhetoric is a surefire way for leaders to get attention and votes.Briefing reporters ahead of the trip on Wednesday, National Security Adviser Susan Rice didn\\u2019t bring up gay rights until prompted. \\u201cI have no doubt that the president will feel perfectly free to raise his concerns,\\u201d she said. But she was careful to convey that Obama isn\\u2019t singling out any country or region. \\u201cThis is not for us an issue of Africa, or any country in Africa,\\u201d she said.A \\u201cnonissue\\u201d that\\u2019s not on the agenda is how Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta referred to LGBT rights ahead of Obama\\u2019s visit, but his No. 2, William Ruto, was among several politicians and clergymen who\\u2019ve railed against homosexuality at Sunday services in recent weeks. Another lawmaker said he would tell Obama to \\u201cshut up\\u201d if he brings it up.Even first lady Michelle Obama (who isn\\u2019t making the trip) is being invoked by opponents of gay rights.\\u201cWe do not want Obama and Obama, we do not want Michelle and Michelle,\\u201d protesters chanted earlier this month at a march organized by a prominent evangelical pastor.On the other hand, international LGBT activists say Obama may have more stature than other Western leaders to make the case for tolerance. Obama, whose father was born in Kenya, is possibly the only Western politician who can speak out against widespread, state-sanctioned discrimination on the African continent without being viewed as an imposing colonialist.\\u201cHe can\\u2019t be dismissed in the same way that others might be dismissed,\\u201d said Graeme Reid, a native of South Africa who directs the LGBT program at the international advocacy group Human Rights Watch. \\u201cHe is highly regarded, he is venerated, and because of that, people are engaging more with this idea.\\u201dObama is the face of American LGBT acceptance in no small part because of his direct confrontations with African leaders.In 2013, Obama tangled publicly with President Macky Sall of Senegal, which bans homosexual relationships, during a news conference the day after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. Hailing the ruling, Obama said it was important for Africans to hear his personal view that \\u201cwhen it comes to how the state treats people, how the law treats people, I believe that everybody has to be treated equally.\\u201dSall replied that while Senegal is a \\u201cvery tolerant\\u201d country, \\u201cwe are still not ready to decriminalize homosexuality.\\u201d Then he took a jab at U.S. credibility on human rights, noting that Senegal had abolished capital punishment \\u2014 drawing cheers from the predominantly Muslim country\\u2019s media for standing up to the American president.Obama also stuck his neck out last year \\u2014 without much success \\u2014 in an effort to prevent Uganda from enacting one of the continent\\u2019s harshest anti-gay laws, which imposes up to a life sentence for \\u201caggravated homosexuality.\\u201d The White House lobbied President Yoweri Museveni to veto the bill in February 2014, and Obama warned that he was \\u201cdisappointed\\u201d with the country and that the bill\\u2019s adoption would \\u201ccomplicate our valued relationship with Uganda.\\u201dSince then, the administration has reassigned some aid funding away from the Ugandan government. Last week, U.S. Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons Randy Berry traveled to Uganda, where he met with the prime minister and other lawmakers in meetings a State Department spokesman called \\u201cvery constructive.\\u201d The openly gay diplomat is the first person to hold the position, created just months ago.Most African countries ban gay sex and make it difficult for LGBT advocacy groups to register, and polls consistently show very deep-seated homophobia across the continent. The origin and severity of those rules and beliefs, however, vary by culture, colonial history and religion.South Africa is a major exception, having legalized same-sex marriage in 2006. And last year, in an unprecedented move, an African Commission on Human and Peoples\\u2019 Rights resolution condemned violence based on sexual and gender identity.The U.S., LGBT advocates say, needs to ever-so-gently fan these positive flames without creating a backlash. It\\u2019s already proven difficult, as Monday\\u2019s White House visit by newly elected Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari showed.The man Buhari defeated, Goodluck Jonathan, pushed through a gay marriage ban in Nigeria that also criminalized public displays of affection between people of the same gender. Buhari had been relatively quiet on these issues, and Jonathan\\u2019s campaign accused him of being an American-backed shill for gay rights.So when the State Department\\u2019s Africa chief, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told reporters ahead of Buhari\\u2019s visit that the administration will \\u201ccontinue to press the government of Nigeria, as well as other governments\\u201d on gay rights, it translated into headlines like \\u201c We\\u2019ll Compel Nigeria to Accept Same-Sex Marriage\\u201d in the Nigerian media. In the end, the White House made no mention of discussing human rights with Buhari, but some U.S. senators did in a subsequent meeting. A Buhari spokesman tweeted in response that the Nigerian president was \\u201cpoint blank. Sodomy is against the law in Nigeria, and abhorrent to our culture.\\u201dBuhari\\u2019s adamant stance isn\\u2019t surprising in light of the polls: A Gallup-affiliated firm in June found that 87 percent of Nigerians supported the ban, and eight in 10 believe gay people should not have equal rights.In the background of the administration\\u2019s emphasis on gay rights is the sense that American evangelical groups have been a driving force behind anti-gay laws in Africa. But the chief of one of those groups, Larry Jacobs of the World Congress of Families, points to the lopsided polls to make the case that it\\u2019s Obama who\\u2019s pushing foreign values on the continent.\\u201cWe know that strengthening families is important to solving poverty, so in my view he\\u2019s actually undermining what could help solve the problems that Africans face,\\u201d Jacobs said. He also noted that the administration has been less vocal about the issue with strategically important Middle Eastern countries that also threaten harsh punishments for homosexuality, including the death penalty.\\u201cI\\u2019m not sure what gives us the right to impose it on poor African nations when we won\\u2019t talk about basic human rights with these other countries,\\u201d he said.At this point, expectations for Obama to talk about gay rights in Kenya are so high that local activists will feel \\u201cbetrayed\\u201d if he doesn\\u2019t, said Eric Gitari, executive director of Kenya\\u2019s National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.\\u201cWe will be left with a blank look on our faces,\\u201d said Gitari, who sent the president a list of proposed talking points via the U.S. Embassy in Kenya. \\u201cMr. Obama is not someone who shies up to a challenge.\\u201dAt least one expected challenger said he\\u2019s standing down: Vincent Kidala, leader of Kenya\\u2019s little-known Republican Liberty party, had planned a protest in Nairobi featuring 5,000 naked prostitutes \\u2014 to show Obama the difference between men and women. But according to The Star newspaper, Kidala cancelled the event after he received a mysterious 2 a.m. phone call from someone promising that the two presidents would not discuss gay rights.Kidala told the newspaper that the protesters will remain on standby just in case.Nick Gass contributed to this report.\"}"
