"{\"article_id\": 65435, \"title\": \"Ariz. judge clears Senate hurdle\", \"content\": \"Eight Republicans crossed the aisle on Monday to help break a GOP-led filibuster against a judicial nominee who drew fierce protest from abortion rights opponents over his analysis of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.On a 60-31 vote, Arizona Supreme Court Justice Andrew D. Hurwitz cleared a critical hurdle en route to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. One Democrat voted against him. A final vote on his confirmation is expected Tuesday.Republicans pointed to a law review article Hurwitz wrote in 2002 as evidence that he supports and admires the analysis behind Roe v. Wade. Hurwitz also served as a clerk in 1972 for U.S. District Court Judge Jon Newman, whose decisions have favored abortion rights.\\u201cThe much-criticized viability cut-off point that formed the basis of Roe came directly from Judge Newman\\u2019s opinion,\\u201d said Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Judiciary committee, later adding: \\u201cI think by any fair measure, it is impossible to read Justice Hurwitz\\u2019s article and not conclude that he wholeheartedly embraces Roe, and importantly, the constitutional arguments that supposedly support it. \\u201cYet enough Republicans were unconvinced, arguing that Hurwitz\\u2019s involvement with Newman\\u2019s decisions were too indirect and occurred long ago.Both Republican Arizona senators, Jon Kyl and John McCain, crossed the aisle to support their fellow Arizonan. Senators Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Scott Brown (R-Mass.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), Lisa Murkowski (R- Alaska) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) also voted in favor, as did the Senate\\u2019s two independents, Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\\u201cI think it is unfair to an extent because he wrote a law review article several years ago in which one can assume he expressed a pro-choice point of view, that, therefore, somehow he would be disqualified from serving on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,\\u201d Kyl said.Two Republicans who approved the confirmation in committee, Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), did not vote in favor. Coburn was not present and Graham voted against Hurwitz.Democrat Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), an abortion rights opponent who has distanced himself from Obama, broke from his party to oppose Hurwitz\\u2019s confirmation.The vote comes amid a flurry of judicial nominations and confirmations, with the Senate confirming two judges last week and Obama adding two nominees Monday.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
