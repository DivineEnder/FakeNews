"{\"title\": \"At Supreme Court, Eric Holder\\u2019s Justice Dept. Routinely Backs Officers\\u2019 Use of Force\", \"content\": \"{\\\"WASHINGTON \\u2014  Teresa Sheehan was alone in her apartment at a mental health center, clutching what her lawyers said was a small bread knife and demanding to be left alone. San Francisco police officers, responding to a call from a social worker, forced open the door, blinded her with pepper spray and shot her.\\\",\\\"It was the kind of violent police confrontation that Attorney GeneralEric H. Holder Jr.has frequently criticized in Cleveland; Albuquerque; Ferguson, Mo.; and beyond. But last month, when Ms. Sheehan\\u2019s civil rights lawsuit reachedthe Supreme Court, the Justice Department backed the police, saying that a lower court should have given more weight to the risks that the officers faced.\\\",\\\"At theSupreme Court, where the limits of police power are established, Mr. Holder\\u2019s Justice Department has supported police officers every time an excessive-force case has made its way to arguments. Even as it has opened more than 20 civil rights investigations into local law enforcement practices, the Justice Department has staked out positions that make it harder for people to sue the police and that give officers more discretion about when to fire their guns.\\\",\\\"Police groups see Mr. Holder as an ally in that regard, and that pattern has rankled civil rights lawyers, who say the government can have a far greater effect on policing by interpreting law at theSupreme Courtthan through investigations of individual departments.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere is an inherent conflict between people at the Justice Department trying to stop police abuses and other people at the Justice Department convincing the Supreme Court that police abuses should be excused,\\u201d saidRonald L. Kuby, a Manhattan civil rights lawyer.\\\",\\\"To some extent, conflict is built into the system. The Justice Department\\u2019s core mission is law enforcement. It oversees the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, among others. In every administration, it is in the government\\u2019s interest for federal agents to have as much leeway, and as little liability, as possible.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s natural that the instinctive reaction of the department is to support law enforcement interests, even when a particular case may have compelling facts for the individual defendant,\\u201d saidNeal K. Katyal, a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration. He said the Justice Department had a duty to tell the court what effect a ruling could have for federal law enforcement agencies.\\\",\\\"When police abuse cases make it to the Supreme Court, even if they have nothing to do with federal agents, the Justice Department often weighs in. Last year, the department sided with police officers in West Memphis, Ark., who shot a driver and passenger 15 times, killing them at the end of a chase.\\\",\\\"John F. Bash, a Justice Department lawyer in that case,told the justicesthat \\u201cthere is some level of reckless driving in response to a police pursuit that authorizes the use of deadly force.\\u201d What was certain, he added, was that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity, which shields them from civil rights lawsuits. The Supreme Courtunanimously agreed.\\\",\\\"Every such victory makes it harder for citizens to prevail when they believe they have been mistreated by police officers. It also adds obstacles for the Justice Department\\u2019s own civil rights investigators when alleging police misconduct. That has led to some tense debates inside the department, current and former officials say, as the government\\u2019s civil rights and appellate lawyers discussed when the department should weigh in, and on which side. Those debates have led the Justice Department to take more nuanced positions than government lawyers might have otherwise, the officials said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cLaw enforcement officers are routinely called upon to face grave dangers and to make often-unheralded sacrifices, and the law must give them the room to make real-time judgments to protect public safety,\\u201d said Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman. \\u201cAt the same time, building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve and protecting human life and human dignity requires accountability for law enforcement officers. The department recognizes \\u2014 and is committed to striking \\u2014 that balance.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Holder has called the civil rights division the crown jewel of the department, and it has rarely had such a high profile. Even before it garnered national attention with ascathing rebuke of the Ferguson Police Departmentafter the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white officer last summer, the division issued similar reports on other departments, including those in Seattle, Albuquerque, Newark and New Orleans.\\\",\\\"Those efforts, along with deeply personal remarks from Mr. Holder about racial profiling, have drawn criticism from police officers who say he has not supported them. But Darrel W. Stephens, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said many officers probably did not know how often Mr. Holder\\u2019s Justice Department stood with them at the Supreme Court. \\u201cHe\\u2019s sincere,\\u201d Mr. Stephens said. \\u201cHe is supportive of the police.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Private civil rights lawyers, though, have been frustrated that the Justice Department\\u2019s aggressive stance in civil rights reports does not extend to its positions before the Supreme Court. \\u201cA report can have an impact on a department for a time,\\u201d said Gary Smith, the lawyer for the driver in the Arkansas case. \\u201cBut case law touches every officer in every department in the country.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Eventually, he predicted, police departments facing civil rights investigations will challenge the Justice Department on its apparently contradictory positions. \\u201cYou\\u2019re telling the Supreme Court it\\u2019s O.K., and you\\u2019re doing this to us?\\u201d Mr. Smith said.\\\",\\\"When Justice Department lawyers argue before the Supreme Court, they typically draw fine distinctions and avoid outright contradictions. But such cases can send seemingly mixed messages. For example, the civil rights division said in December that police officers in Cleveland were too quick to use force against mentally ill people. For support, it cited the federal appeals court decision in the case of the mentally ill woman in San Francisco \\u2014 the same decision that Justice Department lawyers would argue against a few months later.\\\",\\\"Similarly, the Justice Department criticized the Sheriff\\u2019s Office in Franklin County, Ohio, in 2010 for usingstun gunson inmates while they were handcuffed and posed no threat, or when they committed minor rule violations. In aSupreme Court caseto be heard this month, theJustice Department has sidedwith Wisconsin jail officials who used astun gunon an inmate after he was handcuffed and taken from his cell for refusing to remove a piece of paper covering a light fixture in his cell.\\\",\\\"The Justice Department sees those cases as evidence not of conflict but of how its lawyers strike a balance. In the Sheehan case from San Francisco, despite siding with the police, they argued that officers must make some accommodation for a person\\u2019s mental illness when making an arrest. And in the Wisconsin case, they agreed with the inmate about the legal standard needed to prove abuse, even as they again supported the police.\\\",\\\"For Mr. Holder, altering the approach to police abuse cases would amount to a major policy change, one that F.B.I. agents and other federal investigators would surely oppose, said William R. Yeomans, an American University law professor who served in senior roles in the civil rights division during the Clinton administration. So when tensions arise, protecting federal agents almost always wins. \\u201cObviously it\\u2019s a problem,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe institutional interests in support of law enforcement are very powerful and very real.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Because of that history,Steven R. Shapiro, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said it was unfair to criticize Mr. Holder\\u2019s tenure too harshly. The Justice Department has always advocated its law enforcement authority, he said. And the A.C.L.U. often opposes those efforts. But he said no administration had done more to curb police abuses or to force a national debate over the issue.\\\",\\\"\\u201cCivil rights has a voice at the table more often and more prominently under this administration than in previous administrations. It\\u2019s not merely symbolic,\\u201d he said. \\u201cTo the extent there is dissonance, we\\u2019re noticing the dissonance because the civil rights voice is more prominent than in the past.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 338654}"
