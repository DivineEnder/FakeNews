And they questioned whether the new steps, a package worth about $2.2 billion, would have any more measurable impact than previous stimulus plans Mr. Hollande has announced in his yearslong effort to reviveFrance. Despite being the second-largest eurozone economy after Germany, it has struggled to bounce back from the slowdown that befell much of Europe after the global financial crisis of 2008.\\\",\\\"Mr. Hollande has vowed repeatedly not to run for a second presidential term unless there is a downturn in unemployment, which has risen to an 18-year high of 10.6 percent, from around 9.7 percent since he came to power in 2012.\\\",\\\"The economy recently began to emerge from three years of stagnation, but it has failed to create enough jobs to reduce the pool of 3.5 million people seeking work. Youth unemployment in France, at 25.7 percent, is among the highest in Europe, adding to social precariousness in the marginalized banlieues \\u2014 suburban enclaves heavily populated by Muslim residents.\\\",\\\"Unemployment is above 40 percent in some banlieues, where young people face particularly high hurdles in finding permanent work.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere is an economic and social emergency,\\u201d Mr. Hollande told business and labor leaders in a speech on Monday describing his plans. The language echoed statements he made after theParis attacksin November, when he put France under a state of emergency and pledged to ramp up military spending and domestic security to prevent new terrorist acts on French soil.\\\",\\\"With little more than a year to campaign for France\\u2019s presidential elections in 2017, the president is facing a growing challenge from rivals. Despite the fact that Mr. Hollande posted improved poll ratings for his handling of the terrorist attacks, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, has gained ground against him by hammering the twin themes of nationalism and economic weakness.\\\",\\\"Ms. Le Pen posted a party statement on Twitter on Monday dismissing the plan as \\u201cineffective\\u201d and an election ploy, and warned that unemployment would not decline without a \\u201creindustrialization of France.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Hollande acknowledged that the economy, now growing at an annual pace of a little more than 1 percent, remained too weak to reduce France\\u2019s unemployment rate, which is more than twice Germany\\u2019s rate of 4.5 percent.\\\",\\\"The French economy created only 40,000 private sector jobs last year, although many more jobs were destroyed during the downturn, France\\u2019s labor minister, Myriam El Khomri, told French newspapers this month. \\u201cThat means that although the economy is taking off again, growth is still too timid,\\u201d she said.\\\",\\\"Business investment remains weak despite \\u20ac40 billion in tax breaks approved by Mr. Hollande in 2014 in an effort to spur corporate profitability. Consumer spending, which has also failed to revive, took an extra hit after Islamic State militants killed 130 people in a coordinated terror spree in November.\\\",\\\"Mr. Hollande\\u2019s newest measures, on top of similar initiatives unveiled in the last two years, aim to bolster employment.\\\",\\\"The blueprint provides a new layer of subsidies for small and midsize businesses \\u2014 this time a bonus of \\u20ac2,000 for companies that hire and retain a full-time employee for more than six months. Last summer, Mr. Hollande unveiled an aid plan of \\u20ac4,000 for single-person businesses that hired their first worker on a yearlong contract.\\\",\\\"More controversial is a plan to put 500,000 unemployed people into vocational training programs this year, on top of 150,000 announced in October \\u2014 an action that would, at least temporarily, remove more than half a million people from the unemployment rolls.\\\",\\\"The government also wants to reduce youth unemployment, in part by putting tens of thousands of young people to work in so-called civic service volunteer programs. In 2015, 60,000 young people were enrolled in civic service programs; this year, the government wants to more than double it to 150,000.\\\",\\\"Still, political rivals quickly questioned whether the incentives amounted to little more than putting a bandage on a gaping wound. Last week, for example, the manufacturing giant General Electric announced plans to cut up to 6,500 jobs globally, including 765 positions in France.\\\",\\\"Critics also attacked Mr. Hollande\\u2019s plan as a naked grab to salvage his candidacy at a time when even some members of his Socialist party have suggested that he not automatically be their main candidate heading into next year\\u2019s elections.\\\",\\\"\\u201cPresident Hollande is starting the year with a lie to the French,\\u201d \\u00c9ric Woerth, a member of the conservative Republican party, which is led by former President Nicolas Sarkozy, said on Monday. \\u201cEven if 500,000 people can get training, you need 500,000 jobs to hire them into,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOtherwise it\\u2019s back to the unemployment line the day after\\u201d the program ends.\\\",\\\"Mr. Hollande was already facing his party\\u2019s opposition to more far-reaching, centrist economic proposals that he had announced in the last year. A so-called responsibility pact, in which the government granted tax breaks in exchange for job-creation pledges by businesses, was opposed by unions, which said the pact gave too many concessions to employers.\\\",\\\"Mr. Hollande has also sought to loosen restrictive labor practices, making it easier for companies to lay off employees in some cases and to cut workers\\u2019 pay and hours when times are hard. So far, though, those measures have had a limited impact.\\\",\\\"On Monday, he gave reassurances that the latest measures were not a \\u201cstatistic artifice\\u201d aimed solely at lowering the numbers of unemployed people.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe can\\u2019t correct statistics,\\u201d he said. Employment, he added, is \\u201cthe only issue that goes beyond the need to assure the security\\u201d of France.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
