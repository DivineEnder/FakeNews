"{\"title\": \"Charles Krauthammer: Change Redskins Name Because It's 'a Slur'\", \"content\": \"Appearing on Fox News\\u2019s Special Report on Monday, Krauthammer said\\u00a0though he did not think there is \\u201cany intent of malice\\u201d and there is no \\u201cintent of a slur,\\u201d \\u201cwords have histories of their own, and they evolve.\\u201d\\u201cThe word Negro, 50 years ago, was the most respected word in referring to an African American. It was used 15 times by Martin Luther King in the I Have a Dream speech,\\u201d Krauthammer said. \\u201cFifty years later, because of its own history, having to do with Black Power and a complicated history, it\\u2019s become a word that is patronizing. You would never say there are 30 Negroes in the U.S. House. You wouldn\\u2019t say that.\\u201dKrauthammer, in a debate with George Will and Kirsten Powers, said, \\u201cin the same way, Redskins has evolved.\\u201d\\u201cAnd despite its history, it is now considered a slur,\\u201d he said. \\u201cGrowing up, I used to use the word gyp. I never knew until I became an adult that it was a shortening of Gypsy. And I didn\\u2019t take a poll of Gypsies at that point to see how many are offended. I stopped using it. It\\u2019s very easy to do. It has nothing to do with the sensitivities of a mass of people. It has to do with simple, elementary respect. You don\\u2019t use that word if you can avoid it.\\u201dKrauthammer made the same argument with Bill O\\u2019Reilly on Tuesday\\u2019s O\\u2019Reilly Factor.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 130976}"
