"{\"content\": \"The established media made Irving\\u2019s mayor, Beth Van Duyne, into a target for accusations of \\u2018Islamophobia\\u2019 and supposed bigotry. Now, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas, the mayor provided some insight into what it\\u2019s like to be the focus of the media\\u2019s narrative machine, and why she\\u2019s hopeful that new media is providing an alternate view.Back in March, Van Duyne expressed her support for a Texas bill nicknamed \\u2018American Laws for American Courts,\\u2019 which said that American law supersedes foreign laws, including Islam\\u2019s Sharia law.That declaration caused a protest of about five hundred local residents, including some from the local Muslim community, and it made Mayor Van Duyne the target of the national media\\u2019s attacks.Then came \\u201cClock Boy\\u201d Ahmed. Seemingly out of nowhere, the ginned-up story about Irving resident Ahmed Mohamed became national news in September, and was shot into the media stratosphere by a social media shout-out from President Barack Obama.As Merrill Hope from Breitbart Texas reported, that sent the attacks on Van Duyne into overdrive:\\u2026the very same\\u00a0media pushed a\\u00a0hard Islamophobia narrative when covering\\u00a0Van Duyne, Irving\\u2019s conservative mayor. Nevermind she balanced the city\\u2019s budget, increased property values and delivered AAA ratings from Moody\\u2019s and Standard & Poors during one of the weakest American economies, progressives\\u00a0meant to\\u00a0malign\\u00a0her as an \\u201canti-Muslim Republican,\\u201d\\u00a0marginalize\\u00a0her for supporting law enforcement, and mock\\u00a0her patriotism.Hyperlinks in \\u201cClock Boy\\u201d pick up stories often route back to the\\u00a0Dallas Morning News, the apparent mouthpiece of the progressive\\u00a0narrative. The outlet\\u00a0pounced\\u00a0on\\u00a0Van Duyne for backing Irving school\\u00a0officials and the\\u00a0police department following Mohamed\\u2019s Sept. 14 arrest. The\\u00a0Dallas newspaper has been pretty free range in knocking Van Duyne, although the mere\\u00a0mention of\\u00a0Ahmed\\u2019s previous school discipline issues\\u00a0or his\\u00a0alleged uncooperativeness while under arrested get treated like\\u00a0sacrilege.Those attacks fueled by the media also generated online threats:Fifteen online communications obtained exclusively by\\u00a0Breitbart Texas reveal Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne as the target of\\u00a0troubling threats\\u00a0and foul-mouthed attacks made over the\\u00a0Dallas suburban school district\\u2019s handling of\\u00a014-year-old Ahmed Mohamed, the boy who brought into high school an unassigned homemade clock creation perceived as \\u201choax\\u201d bomb last month.This latest crop of emails, tweets and Facebook posts display\\u00a0an alarming tone\\u00a0of misogyny and sexual harassment. Some even advocate\\u00a0sexual violence towards the mayor.\\u00a0Thursday night, Irving police released 14 pages of messages and social media comments detailing threats sent to the city\\u2019s mayor and police following the Ahmed \\u201cClock Boy\\u201d controversy.In an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas, Van Duyne gave her side. The mayor said:I feel like we\\u2019ve gotten so far into \\u2018political correctness\\u2019 that now being pro-America is somehow being anti-PC, and I think it\\u2019s frustrating because those of us who have taken a role\\u2014taken an oath as an elected official\\u2014obviously, we have pledged our allegiance to the United States and to our laws. I feel that because we\\u2019re supporting that, we\\u2019re somehow seen and labeled as the bad guys; as anti- something, as bigots, as hateful, and that\\u2019s very frustrating.I\\u2019ve also seen where the media\\u2014instead of telling the entire story or even most of the story\\u2014what you see is the media telling that [small] percent that enforces their narrative, as opposed to actually telling the story and telling the news, they are creating the stories.That has never been more serious than right now, where they are pushing a line and anything that is not supportive of that story doesn\\u2019t get told. It\\u2019s reliant now for those of us who are in the hot seat to put that information forward.But we\\u2019re at a disadvantage. We\\u2019re not the media. We don\\u2019t the reach of people like a ABC, a CNN or a MSNBC, and they know that.Once you start throwing labels on people, you stop having discussion, you shut down all sorts of opening of ideas. You\\u2019re labeled and therefore you\\u2019re dismissed. That has been attempted, I think in this case, by intimidation \\u2014 \\u201cStop talking, don\\u2019t go there, either fall in line or go away.\\u201dI think what you\\u2019re seeing all around the country is \\u2013 that line\\u2019s not working anymore. People are starting to recognize that we need to speak up. Just because the media\\u2019s bashing you, you have enough different new sources right that are telling the story, that there are other people starting to listen, and being very supportive too.We need to hear both sides.Follow Breitbart\\u00a0News\\u00a0investigative reporter\\u00a0and\\u00a0Citizen\\u00a0Journalism\\u00a0School founder Lee Stranahan on Twitter at\\u00a0@Stranahan.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 305982, \"title\": \"EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Texas Mayor Took on Sharia, Now Hits Media's Attacks on American Patriotism\"}"
