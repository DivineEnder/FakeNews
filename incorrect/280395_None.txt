"{\"title\": \"Clooney's Clown\", \"content\": \"As a kid, I wanted to be James Bond. Sneaking into villainous volcano lairs in-between hayloft romps with the likes of Pussy Galore is very appealing to a twelve-year old \\u2026 and a forty-two year old. For a lucky few, that glamorous life may be somewhat of a reality but as someone intimidated by both violence and pretty girls, the life of a super spy was not to be. However, had the world been my toy box, had the power and influence to shape my environment to my liking been available to me, right now I\\u2019d be slugging it out with faceless henchmen on a nuclear sub.Good thing for me that\\u2019s not reality. Because if it were, I\\u2019d be a fool unaware the whole world was laughing at the effort that went into my self-important delusion.Which brings me to Keith Olbermann. The best way to understand Olbermann is to suffer through George Clooney\\u2019s sterile and pretentious docudrama, \\u201cGood Night, and Good Luck\\u201d (2005). David Strathairn  plays real-life CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow and the film dramatizes Murrow\\u2019s confrontation with Hollywood\\u2019s favorite clich\\u00e9 whipping boy, Senator Joseph McCarthy.   (I know, can you believe Clooney went after Joe McCarthy? Until Sean Penn stood up for gay marriage in front of all those people at the Oscars, it was the single bravest thing ever.)Not only is Clooney\\u2019s film a tired exercise in liberal wish-fulfillment (a black and white \\u201cFrost/Nixon\\u201d), it\\u2019s a dishonest one that tells half the truth  and carries a fascist streak down its back a mile wide. Clooney\\u2019s theme is a simple but frightening one. He\\u2019s telling the media that their job is not to present the facts, not to present both sides of an issue, but to present \\u201cthe truth.\\u201d This all sounds lofty until you realize whose truth he\\u2019s talking about, and as we saw during the 2008 presidential election, most of the media took this to heart.I\\u2019m lucky the world is not at my disposal to fulfill a childish James Bond fantasy, unfortunately for Olbermann, MSNBC was at his disposal.  I can\\u2019t track down when Olbermann started poaching Murrow\\u2019s \\u201cGood night, and good luck\\u201d sign off, it might have been before the film came out, but if you watch Clooney\\u2019s fascist little screed followed by a couple \\u201cCountdown\\u201d episodes, it\\u2019s all too obvious \\u2013 from the camera angles, self-righteous indignation, and use of Bill O\\u2019Reilly in place of McCarthy \\u2013 that MSNBC is Olbermann\\u2019s toy box to fulfill his dream of becoming George Clooney\\u2019s idea of Murrow.If I could wish anything on Olbermann it would be the power of self-awareness. Once the embarrassment hit, he\\u2019d never leave the house again.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 280395}"
