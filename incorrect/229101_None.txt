"{\"title\": \"Capitol Hill Chevy Volt Hearing: What About All the Other Fires?\", \"content\": \"I attended Wednesday\\u2019s 8:00am (8am?!?) House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing entitled:\\n\\nVolt Vehicle Fire: What Did NHTSA Know And When Did They Know It?The witnesses were killer:National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), Barack Obama-appointee Administrator David Strickland.And General Motors (GM), Barack Obama-appointee CEO Dan Akerson.The scope of the hearing was a bit too narrow \\u2013 leaving out some fairly important attending facts.   Like, say, the (at least) five other Chevy Volt fires that have occurred besides the one being discussed.This hearing was all about a single June Volt blaze.   The battery burst into flames about three weeks after a test crash at and by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).A fire about which Obama\\u2019s NHTSA did tell the Obama White House.But a fire about which neither Obama\\u2019s NHTSA, the Obama Administration nor Obama\\u2019s GM told the American people for nearly six months \\u2013 and then did so only when forced by a looming Bloomberg news story.But:\\n\\nThe White House had no role in the decision to delay disclosure of a fire that broke out in a crash-tested Chevrolet Volt, the Obama administration told Congress on Friday.Of COURSE not.But:\\n\\nJoan Claybrook, a former administrator at NHTSA believes part of the reason for the delay was the \\u201cfragility of Volt sales.\\u201d Yet she also believes that \\u201cNHTSA could have put out a consumer alert, not to tell them [customers] for six months makes no sense to me.\\u201dObama is running for reelection in great part on the non-success \\u201csuccess\\u201d of the $85 billion auto industry bailout.On which he once promised we\\u2019d make money.   Then had to begrudgingly up the (admitted to) loss from $14.3 billion to $23.6 billion.And We the Taxpayers still own 500 million shares of GM stock \\u2013 which is tanking.   So that loss number still has growth prospects.That auto industry bailout \\u201csuccess.\\u201dObama mentioned GM prominently in Tuesday night\\u2019s campaign \\u2013 I mean State of the Union \\u2013 speech:\\n\\nAmerica: Built to (Be) LastAnd had as one of his bio-props \\u2013 I mean guests \\u2013 a GM plant manager.The takeaway from all of this?For Obama, notifying Americans of their potential immolation-by-Volt is of less import than his keeping his gig past November.\\u2014\\u2013And there\\u2019s tremendous immolation potential.The one NHTSA Volt fire discussed at the hearing was not the only NHTSA Volt fire that occurred.   In November, there were two others.\\n\\nAfter conducting three different tests two weeks ago, the NHTSA found that the Volt\\u2019s battery either caught fire or began to smoke in two out of the three.So that\\u2019s three Volt fires \\u2013 all in the hands of the Obama Administration, all after crashes.But Obama\\u2019s GM now says they\\u2019ve fixed the problem \\u2013 and the Obama Administration has (shocker) given GM the good-to-go.So all is well, right?Ummm, no.   There were in fact three other, private-owner Volt fires.   None of which involved Volts that were in crashes.\\u2014\\u2013There was the Volt that in April burst into flames \\u2013 twice.   These were the fires that led to Obama\\u2019s NHTSA beginning its investigation.And then in November another Volt leapt into flames.   While Obama\\u2019s NHTSA was still investigating \\u2013 but after the NHTSA-Obama Administration-GM cover-up had come to light (get it?).The home that garaged this particular immolated Volt gets its power from Duke Energy \\u2013 which after the fire felt compelled to issue a warning:\\n\\nDuke Energy officials want anyone who has a (Volt) charging station to stop using it until they know the devices are safe.So the charging station is at least suspect.   (So too  the charging station cable?)We still have no idea what caused these fires.   The only thing we do know is that they were not caused by crashes \\u2013 because these cars were never in crashes.So why did Obama\\u2019s NHTSA, the Obama Administration and Obama\\u2019s GM singularly focus on (but one of three)  post-crash Volt fires?When none of these three privately-owned combustible Volts had been in accidents?We \\u2013 still \\u2013 don\\u2019t know.   Anything.But don\\u2019t worry: The Obama Administration has declared that the Obama-owned GM Chevy Volt is perfectly safe \\u2013 just in time for Obama\\u2019s reelection campaign.And GM\\u2019s new Volt ad campaign, which is pretty much entitled:\\n\\nIf You Don\\u2019t Like the Volt, You Don\\u2019t Like AmericaDon\\u2019t you feel safer?\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 229101}"
