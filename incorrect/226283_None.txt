"{\"title\": \"If Obama Doesn't Win Tonight, Media Will Bring Out the Knives\", \"content\": \"For Democrat politicians, the media is a very fickle mistress. Yes, they will fall in love with you at first sight. They will coddle and nurture them and train all their resources to attack their critics. They will ignore inconvenient news and hype their smallest accomplishments. All the politicians have to do is keep winning.\\u00a0As long as Obama is seen to be winning, the media\\u2019s love affair with him endures. But, if Obama looks like he is going to lose the election, media criticism of him will intensify. They have done their best to prop him up this election, even going so far as declaring the race \\u201cover\\u201d last month.\\u00a0But, as the first debate showed, the race is decidedly not over. Obama performance was so bad, and Romney\\u2019s so good, that even MSNBC couldn\\u2019t spin the results. Since then, Obama has done nothing to contain Romney\\u2019s strengthening support. He briefly made a widely mocked attempt to make Big Bird (!) a campaign issue, but otherwise hasn\\u2019t raised any new attacks against Romney. If he doesn\\u2019t score a knock-out night, to change the trajectory of the campaign, the media will feel compelled to throw him under the bus.\\u00a0Given the fawning treatment he has enjoyed since arriving on the national political scene, it seems counter-intuitive that the media would turn on him. But, their loyalty is to leftist ideology, not a single politician. If a politician\\u2019s campaign falters, the media will turn to protect the ideology.\\u00a0If Obama loses in November, it can\\u2019t be because voters rejected government intrusion into health care. It can\\u2019t be because voters rejected higher taxes, jacked-up government spending, green energy subsidies and a wasted stimulus. It can\\u2019t be because voters reject our tee-ball approach to foreign policy. The loss has to be isolated to Obama specifically. The voters aren\\u2019t rejecting the policies, they are rejecting his individual candidacy.\\u00a0Howard Fineman at HuffPo floated this notion yesterday, summarizing some of the \\u201creasons\\u201d to explain an Obama loss. Mostly it boiled down to Obama not being a very good salesman of his policies. It isn\\u2019t the policies, per se, that are the problem, but rather how Obama presents them to the American people. \\u00a0The media will never admit to itself that voters don\\u2019t want higher taxes and don\\u2019t want government further encroaching on their health care decisions. If Obama looks like he\\u2019s going to lose the election, then it will be because of mistakes he made.\\u00a0If Obama fails tonight, for the media the writing will be on the wall. They will destroy Obama in an attempt to preserve the policies that delivered his defeat.\\u00a0Follow me on twitter\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 226283}"
