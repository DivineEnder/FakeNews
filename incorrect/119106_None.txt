But I can tell you thatPresident Obama and I are determined, and neither of us will stopin our efforts to pursue the possibility (of peace).\\u201dPalestinian president Mahmoud Abbas was quoted as saying:\\u00a0\\u201cThe Palestinians are committed to negotiations thatwould lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinianstate with east Jerusalem as its capital.\\u201dReports indicate that Saudi Arabia has for years invested a great dealof money in Pakistani nuclear weapons, and that nuclear weapons made inPakistan on behalf of Saudi Arabia are now sitting ready fordelivery.  Technology for the weapons comes from China.  Saudiofficials have been saying for years that they would not tolerate Iranhaving a nuclear capability unless the Saudis also had one.\\u00a0The Saudis could take delivery of the nuclear weapons in eitherof two different ways.  First, Pakistan could just delivernuclear weapons for Saudi Arabia to use, though that wouldbe considered an extremely provocative action in internationaleyes.\\u00a0The second way would be for Pakistan to send its own troopsto maintain the nuclear weapons in Saudi Arabia, and maintaincontrol over them.  This is similar to the way that theUnited States stations nuclear weapons in some countries,keeping them under control of U.S. armed forces.\\u00a0As I\\u2019ve been saying for years, the coming Clash of Civilizations worldwar will pit the United States, India, Iran and others against China,Pakistan, the Sunni Muslim countries, and others.  When I first madethat prediction in 2005, based on a Generational Dynamics analysis, itseemed completely likely to be unfulfilled, but the trend lines in thepast couple of years indicate that the prediction will be fulfilled.BBCGirls wearing burning Twin Towers costumesFamilies of 9/11 victims are expressing outrage that two 19-year-oldcollege girls at University of Chester in Britain won a costumecontest by wearing two of the most grotesque costumes of all time:matching costumes labeled \\u201cNorth Tower\\u201d and \\u201cSouth Tower,\\u201d with headpieces that represented smoke billowing from the tops of the doomedskyscrapers and individuals leaping to their deaths.
