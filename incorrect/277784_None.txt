"{\"article_id\": 277784, \"content\": \"So last Monday\\u2019s Gregalogue on the Climate Change conference caused a flurry of emails.Well, not really a flurry.More like twelve. But if climate change apostles can exaggerate facts, why can\\u2019t I?Anyway, I got one missive, which I condensed, from a guy named Jonathan. It goes:\\n\\nJonathan then cited a poll where a large majority of respondents accept human activity as a global warming cause.Fair enough \\u2013 but Johnny, my Gregalogue was about how critical viewpoints regarding global warming hysteria aresuppressed in favor of opinions kowtowing to pre-ordained, biased assumptions. That\\u2019s why I asked if any one had heard of this Gallup Poll revealing heavy skepticism. It didn\\u2019t matter when that poll was published, only that it was dismissed by people like you.But you\\u2019re right, there has been more research since then. Take that infamous \\u201cHockey stick\\u201d chart \\u2013 you know, the graph that showed flat temperatures for centuries, then suddenly in the last century, rises sharply like the end of a hockey stick. Global warming apostles once called it proof of recent, devastating human-caused global warming.On closer examination though, experts found that real, very old instances of global warming had been erased in order to make it look like the planet was heating up now.Oddly, we all heard about this amazing, conclusive evidence when it first came out. But when it was later revealed to be a piece of crap?Nothing.Look, there are more examples of bias that I can give you \\u2013 but you\\u2019re right \\u2013 this is a new science, which is exactly why this hysteria is so criminal. The fact is, if a scientific conclusion is embraced well before the science is thoroughly examined \\u2013 and then infected with a sense of overzealous activism by folks with a thirst for recognition and power \\u2013 it\\u2019s no wonder that critical viewpoints are ultimately \\u201csmoothed out,\\u201d like discrepancies on a hockey stick chart.Anyway, Jonathan, thanks for the letter and the photos.I hope we\\u2019re still on for lunch.Tonight we have Anthony Cumia from Opie and Anthony, the lovely Remi Spencer and the always awesome Jonathan Hoenig! \", \"title\": \"Daily Gut: Thank the Media for Climate Change Hysteria\", \"source_id\": 2}"
