"{\"title\": \"WATCH: Julia Hartley-Brewer: Newspapers 'Bottled It' By Not Showing Charlie Hebdo Cartoons\", \"content\": \"Broadcaster and columnist Julia Hartley-Brewer gave an impassioned defence of freedom of expression on BBC Question Time last night.Criticising the decision by British newspapers not to print the Charlie Hebdo cartoons depicting Mohammed, she accused them of \\u201cbottling it\\u201d and slammed the terrorists for scaring people into submission.\\u201cThe only reason I\\u2019m not wearing a t-shirt today with the prophet Mohammed in a cartoon on it is because I don\\u2019t want to be killed. I\\u2019ve got a daughter and I want to stay alive for her and I\\u2019m scared, and the reason why all the newspaper editors didn\\u2019t [print the cartoons] is because they\\u2019re scared they\\u2019ll be murdered, their staff will be murdered and their families will be murdered.\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t about respect for religion, this is about fear of religious fundamentalists and we need to stop letting that fear affect us\\u2026\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 184544}"
