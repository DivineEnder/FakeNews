There are huge discrepancies, and it wouldn\\u2019t surprise me if they went here next. See a summary below from Karuna.The Washington Free Beacon had previously reported that Clinton\\u2019s Senate office also paid women \\u201c72 cents for each dollar paid to men,\\u201d showing more evidence that Clinton has not been watchful of \\u201cequal pay\\u201d as she claims to be on the presidential campaign trail.In fact, Hillary for America claims that the gender pay gap amounts to \\u201cworkplace discrimination\\u201d:Women earn less than men across our economy\\u2014and women of color often lose out the most. We should promote pay transparency across the economy and work to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act\\u2014a bill Hillary introduced as senator\\u2014to give women the tools they need to fight discrimination in the workforce.However, the Free Beacon reported that during Clinton\\u2019s years in the Senate, \\u201cthe median annual salary for a woman working in Clinton\\u2019s office was $15,708.38 less than the median salary for a man, according to the analysis of data compiled from official Senate expenditure reports.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 218765}"
