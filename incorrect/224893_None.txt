Hamasofficials are accusing Egypt of making the siege of Gaza worse thanever by destroying smuggling tunnels and closing the Rafah bordercrossing:\\u201cEven [former Egyptian president] Hosni Mubarak didnot starve the Gaza Strip.  By destroying the tunnels withoutproviding an alternative, the Egyptians are punishing the entirepopulation of the Gaza Strip and deepening the humanitarian andeconomic crisis.\\u201dOver the past few days, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have reportedthat Egyptian military helicopters have been flying over parts ofGaza, as part of the massive military crackdown that\\u2019s in progress inSinai.

Gaza used to be part of Egypt until the 1967war with Israel, when Israel took control.  In 2005, the Israelis gaveGaza to the Palestinians, and in 2008, Hamas took control of it.Jerusalem PostEgypt\\u2019s Army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi on Wednesday called for massdemonstrations on Friday to give the military a mandate to crackdownon \\u201cviolence and terrorism.\\u201d  According to El-Sisi:\\n\\u201cI ask \\u2026 that next Friday all honest and trustworthyEgyptians must come out.  Why come out? They come out to give methe mandate and order that I confront violence and potentialterrorism.\\u201dThe army arrested President Mohamed Morsi on July 3, about a yearafter he and his Muslim Brotherhood party the first free presidentialelection in Egypt\\u2019s history, and about six months after Morsisuspended the constitution and gave himself dictatorial powers.  Morsihas not been since in public since his arrest.  Many other Brotherhoodofficials have also been arrested, and more were arrested onWednesday.  About 30% of Egypt\\u2019s population belong to the MuslimBrotherhood, and since July 3, there have been huge daily protestsacross the country, demanding that Morsi be returned to thepresidency.  So now the Army chief is asking for a huge anti-Morsidemonstration on Friday, to give the army a \\u201cmandate.\\u201d  So it nowappears that there are going to be huge pro- and anti-Morsi rallies onFriday, with many opportunities for confrontation and violence.Muslim Brotherhood activists are furious that El-Sisi implied thatBrotherhood members were guilty of \\u201cviolence and terrorism,\\u201despecially after dozens of Brotherhood supporters have been killed bythe Army in recent weeks.However, El-Sisi may have been referring to the Sinai, where al-Qaedalinked militants with links to some hardline Brotherhood members havebeen conducting terrorists attacks, causing Egyptian, Israeli andnearby U.S. forces to be put on alert.  al-Arabiya (Dubai) and al-Ahram (Cairo)According to a Pentagon spokesman:\\n\\u201cGiven the current situation in Egypt, we do notbelieve it is appropriate to move forward at this time with thedelivery of F-16s.\\u201dU.S. law requires that aid to any country be terminated if the armystates a coup against a democratically elected leader.  Since endingall aid to Egypt would likely be a disaster for the entire Mideast,the Administration has studiously avoided using the word \\u201ccoup\\u201d todescribed what happened in Egypt.  And so the $1.5 billion in aid toEgypt can continue.  But Wednesday\\u2019s announcement is an attempt toappease critics in Washington and, at the same time, to send a signalto Egypt\\u2019s army to restore a \\u201cnormal\\u201d government as quickly aspossible.
