"{\"title\": \"How the media fails on the Iran debate\", \"content\": \"Foreign Policy's Stephen M. Walt, a Harvard international relations professor by day, lists the\\u00a0the top ten media failures\\u00a0in the Iran war debate:#1: Mainstreaming the war. As I've written before, when prominent media organizations keep publishing alarmist pieces about how war is imminent, likely, inevitable, etc., this may convince the public that it is going to happen sooner or later and it discourages people from looking for better alternatives. Exhibits A and B for this problem are Jeffrey Goldberg's September 2010 article in The Atlantic Monthly and Ronan Bergman's February 2012 article in the New York Times Magazine. Both articles reported that top Israeli leaders believed time was running out and suggested that an attack might come soon.#2: Loose talk about Iran's \\\"nuclear [weapons] program.\\\" A recurring feature of Iran war coverage has been tendency to refer to Iran's \\\"nuclear weapons program\\\" as if its existence were an established fact. U.S. intelligence services still believe that Iran does not have an active program, and the IAEA has also declined to render that judgment either. Interestingly, both the Times' public editor Arthur Brisbane and Washington Post ombudsman Patrick Pexton have recently chided their own organizations for muddying this issue.#3: Obsessing about Ahmadinejad. A typical insertion into discussions of Iran is to make various references to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, usually including an obligatory reference to his penchant for Holocaust denial and his famously mis-translated statement about Israel \\\"vanishing from the page of time.\\\" ...And so on...\\u00a0Very worthwhile read for those following the U.S.-Iran-Israel debate.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 87040}"
