"{\"title\": \"China Punishes 50 Websites for 'Creating Panic' with Tianjin Chemical Explosion Reports\", \"content\": \"State media outlet Xinhua reported over the weekend that fifty websites were now under surveillance by the state\\u2019s Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) because the sites had \\u201ccreated panic\\u201d by either \\u201cpublishing unverified information or letting users spread groundless rumors.\\u201d 18 websites had their licenses to operate revoked; 32 were temporarily suspended. Among the rumors Xinhua cites as being published online are: \\u201cthe blasts killed at least 1,000 people,\\u201d \\u201cshopping malls in Tianjin got looted,\\u201d and \\u201cleadership change in Tianjin government.\\u201dXinhua has focused its coverage instead on favorably depicting the government\\u2019s response to the explosion, noting on Monday that 2,000 soldiers and armed police have been deployed to clean up the still-smoldering remains of the chemical storage facility that exploded last Thursday. Civilians have been evacuated from a three-kilometer radius of the blast, as the government fears dangerous fumes are still flowing out of the explosion site.Xinhua notes that 6,000 people have been displaced by the explosion, and the official death toll remains under 150.Other state publications like the\\u00a0People\\u2019s Daily have either attacked the local government of Tianjin, claiming officials have done little to quell the rumors the federal government is trying desperately to suppress. Its coverage of the Beijing communist government generally has been limited to stories like \\u201cPuppy saved from Tianjin explosion site.\\u201dTime\\u00a0notes that the\\u00a0People\\u2019s Daily has turned on one other target, however: Rui Hai International Logistics, the company who owned the chemical storage facility that exploded. In a report, the outlet suggested the company was smuggling an excess of chemicals into the facility.\\u00a0Time\\u00a0confirmed from an employee of a government doing business with Rui Hai that the corporate had indeed stored a high amount of sodium cyanide in the facility.While the exact cause of the explosion is still unknown, the Chinese government has confirmed that sodium cyanide was being kept in that facility. It is believed that up to 700 tons\\u00a0of the dangerous chemical, used to extract gold from ore, was being kept there. That number would be 70 times the amount corporations are legally allowed to store in one place. Such products are to be stored no less than one kilometer from residential areas which, as video of the explosion tragically shows, was not the case in Tianjin.China\\u2019s top prosecutor has vowed that he will \\u201clook into possible illegal acts.\\u201dThe\\u00a0Washington Post notes that relatives of those missing\\u2014still dozens\\u2014gathered to protest on Sunday, the day before predicted rains may further exacerbate the extent of the economic disaster facing Tianjin.\\u00a0\\u201cFrom a legal perspective, it\\u2019s unreasonable that dangerous chemicals would be so close,\\u201d Zhang Yinbao, a protester, told\\u00a0Reuters.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 127848}"
