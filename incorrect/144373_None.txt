"{\"title\": \"Maher: 'Lady Trump,' Should 'Stop Whining Like a Little B*tch'\", \"content\": \"HBO\\u2019s \\u201cReal Time\\u201d host Bill Maher stated that \\u201clady\\u201d presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump should \\u201cstop whining like a little b*tch\\u201d on Friday.After playing a clip of Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins in \\u201cMy Fair Lady\\u201d calling women \\u201cirrational,\\u201d Maher stated, \\u201c[T]hat was how women were viewed in the 1950\\u2019s, irrational, pouty, vain, thin-skinned, hysterical, and just not that bright. Does that sound like anyone we know today? Who, who? Oh, yeah, him. Yes, Donald Trump, who says that if Hillary Clinton was a man, she wouldn\\u2019t get 5% of the vote. And if Trump was a man, he\\u2019d stop whining like a little b*tch. This is a guy who actually brags about his prowess at whining.\\u201dHe added, \\u201cDoes anyone fit the stereotypical 50\\u2019s description of a woman better than Donald Trump? Any cringe-inducing line they ever said about a secretary on \\u2018Mad Men\\u2019 is true about Trump, and yet, he\\u2019s the one with a penis. And we know that, because if you make fun of it, he\\u2019ll be up all night tweeting about how great it is. He accuses Megyn Kelly of being menstrual, but for him, that time of the month is always. Has there ever been anyone more thin-skinned? I made a joke about his father being an orangutan once, and he marched into court with his birth\\u00a0certificate and sued me, because he\\u2019s a whiny little bitch. And if he\\u2019s not suing you, he\\u2019s threatening to sue you, or demanding on apology, or threatening to spill the beans. \\u2026 And I\\u00a0mean this in no way, to disparage vaginas, but, what a p*ssy. I mean, who gets more hysterical than lady Donald Trump saying, \\u2018Mexican rape is everywhere. My salts. My salts. We must build a wall, a giant wall, and ban all the Muslims!\\u2019 It makes [Sen.] Lindsey Graham (R-SC) look like Vin Diesel. This isn\\u2019t presidential. It\\u2019s Glenn Close boiling the rabbit. And, like the daffy typical housewife of the 50\\u2019s, lady Trump is the one who can\\u2019t balance a checkbook. Trump Airlines, Trump casinos, Trump University, Trump Steaks. He\\u2019s got the Midas touch, if every time Midas touched something it exploded.\\u201dMaher concluded, \\u201cSo, never forget, lady Trump, that Hillary Clinton was born a woman, but you chose to live your life as a, say it with me, won\\u2019t you, whiny little b*tch. Which is why if Hillary is the Democratic nominee, I\\u2019ll be voting for the only one who has balls.\\u201d(h/t Mediaite)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 144373}"
