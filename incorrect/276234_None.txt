"{\"title\": \"Obama's Clean Power Plan: Solar Companies Win, Taxpayer's Lose\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"\\u201cThe fundamental objective of the Clean Power Plan,\\u201d according to Solar Industry Magazine, \\u201cis the phasing out of coal-fired power plants in favor of low- or zero-emission sources.\\u201d It does this through three \\u201cbuilding blocks,\\u201d one of which seeks to \\u201cincrease electricity generation from non-emitting renewable sources, such as solar and wind.\\u201dIn a post titled: \\u201cHow Obama\\u2019s Clean Power Plan will fuel the solar industry\\u2019s rapid growth,\\u201d Forbes.com contributor Lyndsey Gilpin, quotes Shayle Kann, senior vice president of GTM Research: \\u201cIt could be a major catalyst for solar nationwide.\\u201d Gilpin points out: \\u201cApart from the Solar Investment Tax Credit, the federal tax credit for solar, the Clean Power Plan is the first national policy for renewable energy.\\u201dWhile the excitement from solar proponents is palpable, it is surprising how shameless they are about sucking the government teat while bemoaning the low price of natural gas\\u2014which Solar Industry Magazine calls \\u201ca fly in the ointment\\u201d and \\u201cinconvenient.\\u201d It blames \\u201cnew technologies for oil and gas extraction\\u201d (no wonder they keep trying to kill hydraulic fracturing). Gilpin states: \\u201cin all its 1,560 pages, the Clean Power Plan doesn\\u2019t directly address the actual deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.As Gilpin points out, \\u201cThe Clean Power Plan is geared toward centralized utility scale solar, meaning electricity sold to wholesale utility buyers, not end customers.\\u201d One such \\u201cutility scale solar\\u201d company is Abengoa. The Spanish solar company was the single largest recipient of taxpayer funding through Obama\\u2019s 2009 Stimulus Bill\\u2014$2.8 billion\\u2014but has been beset with corruption and allegations that it routinely violates U.S. immigration, environmental, and workplace safety laws. The company, currently under investigation by U.S. Customs and Immigration Service and the Department of Labor, creates spinoffs that enable it to move funds from one to the other, apparently hiding money and falsifying records.In November 2014, Abengoa bonds were \\u201chammered on accounting concerns,\\u201d Reuters reported. It added: \\u201cThe company has so many different buckets of debt and management has cleverly used this to report reductions in reported net leverage.\\u201dAt the time, ratings firm Fitch posted the following: \\u201cFitch will closely monitor management\\u2019s response to the current market turmoil and the company\\u2019s access to capital markets in the coming days for any further deterioration in the credit profile.\\u201dIn another November account, Reuters explains: \\u201cAbengoa, an engineering company that expanded massively into renewables, has been struggling with a heavy debt burden since a decade-long economic boom in Spain ended abruptly in 2008.\\u201d It must have seen Obama\\u2019s push for solar as the answer to its problems. It moved into the U.S. with its hand out and high-profile players\\u2014such as former Vice President Al Gore and former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson\\u2014on its team.I\\u2019ve written extensively on Abengoa, as a part of my \\u201cObama\\u2019s green-energy, crony-corruption\\u201d series, and done a detailed report published by The Daily Caller. I\\u2019ve interviewed many former employees and followed its shenanigans. Therefore, I wasn\\u2019t surprised when, on August 3\\u2014the same day Obama\\u2019s Clean Power Plan was touted, headlines announced, once again, that Abengoa shares \\u201cplunged.\\u201dBloomberg reports that the August 3 drop\\u201475.70 percent from its high on September 3, 2014, is because the \\u201ccompany\\u2019s plan to shore up capital failed to reassure investors that it can stop burning cash.\\u201d Reuters adds: \\u201csome analysts are concerned the company is over committing to cash-intensive projects in countries like Brazil and Mexico rather than focusing on cutting debt.\\u201dAbengoa, which went public (NASDAQ) on October 17, 2013 at an opening share price of $12.37, once enjoyed a \\u201ctop pick\\u201d and \\u201csafest\\u201d moniker, hit a high of $28.88 on September 3, 2014 but has now nosedived to $6.50. The law firm Levi & Korinsky\\u2014which claims it has \\u201cextensive expertise in prosecuting securities litigation involving financial fraud, representing investors throughout the nation in securities lawsuits, and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders\\u201d\\u2014now investigates Abengoa and its Board of Directors for possible violations of federal securities laws.A\\u00a0former human resources director at one of Abengoa\\u2019s subsidiaries, who served as my \\u201cdeep throat\\u201d in earlier reporting, said: \\u201cWhat I came to realize, and it took me a while because I didn\\u2019t want to realize it, is that they understood. They knew the law. They didn\\u2019t care. I really came to believe that they\\u2019re so politically connected that it\\u2019s just hubris and arrogance.\\u201dToday, this \\u201ctop pick\\u201d has a 76.9 percent \\u201cprobability of bankruptcy.\\u201d Our taxdollars that won\\u2019t be paid back.So, when you hear the solar power proponents chirping about regulations that encourage investment in solar, incentives to help families, and mechanisms to increase deployment, remember they are taking our tax dollars and giving them to companies like Abengoa that get the funding because of connections.They win. We lose.The author of\\u00a0Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc. and the companion educational organization, the Citizens\\u2019 Alliance for Responsible Energy\\u00a0(CARE).
