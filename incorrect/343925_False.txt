"{\"title\": \"Mayor de Blasio Lays Out Vision for New York in State of the City Address\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Speaking of power-washed streets free of graffiti and new infrastructure projects along the waterfront, MayorBill de Blasioon Thursday laid out a vision of New York that would gleam from pavement to rooftop, while renewing his pledge to create a more equal city without diminishing its quality of life.\\\",\\\"The message from the mayor in his third State of the City address was that residents could and would have it all, and, in some cases, already did. Low crime. An affordable place to live. A Governors Island transformed into an \\u201cinnovation cluster.\\u201d Buses that follow a predictable schedule.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe call these speeches the State of the City,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut to me, that really means the State of Our People.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The pomp of the prepared speech was sandwiched between two tumultuous and unscripted events for Mr. de Blasio. His daybegan with the collapse of a dealto end his two-year political fight to restrict the horse-drawn carriage industry, andconcluded with two police officers shotin a Bronx housing development as he was delivering his address, just five miles away.\\\",\\\"Mr. de Blasio, whose address included several minutes of warm praise for New York City police officers, singling out several by name, learned of the shooting only as he stepped from the stage. He immediately left the building and rushed to the Bronx hospital where the officers were taken; their wounds were not life-threatening, the police said.\\\",\\\"The shooting occurred in the South Bronx, one of three neighborhoods \\u2014 including Far Rockaway, Queens, and Brownsville, Brooklyn \\u2014 that \\u201chaven\\u2019t gotten their due,\\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in his speech. He promised to take \\u201cour fight against inequality\\u201d to those areas in 2016, with significant investments in business, education and health services.\\\",\\\"As the mayor embarks on the second half of his term, withapproval ratingsstill hovering around 50 percent, Mr. de Blasio used his speech to recite, in scattershot form, a list of his accomplishments \\u2014 universal prekindergarten, paid sick leave, contracts signed with most city workers, a municipal identification card for all New Yorkers regardless of immigration status \\u2014 that appeared pitched to his re-election campaign in 2017.\\\",\\\"In the rare evening address, held before a packed theater at Lehman College in the Bronx, Mr. de Blasio did not shy away from his liberal ambitions for New York so much as adapt them to cover a broad range of less ideologically distinct projects that would address the everyday dangers and inconveniences of city life. As inhis budget address last month, Mr. de Blasio made no attempt to offer new grand themes for the coming year.\\\",\\\"Many had been announced in the lead-up to the speech: gun cases in Brooklyn now handled bya special courtto improve outcomes, streetcars linking Queens and Brooklyn along the East River, countdown clocks at bus stops and metered parking that could be paid wirelessly.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf making New Yorkers safer is the first and foremost of our efforts to improve quality of life,\\u201d said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, \\u201cthen helping New Yorkers get around our city swiftly and easily comes next.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Others were new, like focused investments in the three underserved neighborhoods, and a proposal to create a retirement savings plan for private-sector employees that would be run by a board created by the city. Mr. de Blasio also said a new municipal wireless Internet system, known as LinkNYC, would begin on Third Avenue in Manhattan \\u201cwithin a matter of weeks,\\u201d replacing old pay phones.\\\",\\\"In presenting his plans, he described New York as \\u201ca great city of small towns we call neighborhoods, where people stand by each other and have a love for their community that sometimes stretches back generations.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. de Blasio proposed to add a new neighborhood of sorts on Governors Island, where the city would rehabilitate historic buildings, enable year-round access and seek to attract innovative new businesses with \\u201cmillions of new square feet for commerce, culture and research.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mayors have traditionally delivered the State of the City address during the day, a time slot that gives television reporters an opportunity to package stories for the evening news cycle.\\\",\\\"But earlier this year, Mr. de Blasio and his advisers decided to move the speech into the evening, \\u201cfor the first time,\\u201d he said on Thursday. At several points, he referred to those \\u201cwatching at home.\\u201d The upside was twofold: The mayor felt he could draw a larger television audience, and it would limit the time available afterward for his critics to take jabs at him.\\\",\\\"But the increased exposure came with a price, as his failure to shepherd a deal on horse-drawn carriages through the City Council \\u2014 an issue that has plagued him since he took office \\u2014 dominated the news in the hours before the speech, much like the shooting of the two officers overshadowed the coverage afterward.\\\",\\\"A smattering of protesters arrived early to the speech and stood outside, carrying signs reading \\u201cMayor de Blasio has a Latino problem\\u201d and \\u201cStop gentrification.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Some of the proposals announced before the speech drew criticism, includingthe streetcar plan. James S. Oddo, a Republican who is borough president of Staten Island, shared a letter on Twitter that he received from the Transportation Department in November 2014 after he asked the city to determine whether a streetcar line would be feasible in his borough.\\\",\\\"Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, wrote that a study of a smaller proposal for Brooklyn under the Bloomberg administration \\u201cbrought to light the many citywide challenges with respect to reintroducing streetcars to New York City in general.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The city, flush with tax revenues but facing stiff resistance to Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s agenda from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, has moved to contain crises \\u2014 such as homelessness, overcrowded subways and affordable housing \\u2014 without recourse to Albany, when possible. The streetcar line, for example, would be paid for and run by the city, not the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which the state controls.\\\",\\\"The speech on Thursday continued the \\u201cone city\\u201d theme articulated by Mr. de Blasio in his successful campaign for mayor in 2013 and in his previous State of the City addresses.\\\",\\\"Duringhis first address, in 2014, the mayor charted a liberal agenda for the city, pledging to increase benefits for illegal immigrants and expand prekindergarten and after-school programs. To pay for some of his promises, he pledged to raise taxes on the city\\u2019s wealthy residents.\\\",\\\"Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s2015 speech was also long on ambition, but was dampened in part by his bruising battles in Albany the previous year, where some of his agenda was stymied or stopped in its tracks. For instance, the mayor\\u2019s plan to raise taxes on the city\\u2019s elite fell flat in the Capitol.\\\",\\\"Absent from that speech \\u2014 and the one on Thursday \\u2014 was any mention of horses.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 343925}"
