Subpoenaed Clinton Foundation, Huma Abedin's Records\", \"content\": \"The State Department\\u2019s Inspector General reportedly subpoenaed the Clinton Foundation last fall to investigate the foundation\\u2019s projects that may have required government approval while Clinton was Secretary of State, according to a Washington Post report.The subpoena also sought records concerning longtime Hillary Clinton confidante and aide Huma Abedin, who, as the Post noted, \\u201cwas employed simultaneously by the State Department, the foundation, Clinton\\u2019s personal office, and a private consulting firm with ties to the Clintons.\\u201d Lawmakers like Rep. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) have questioned Abedin\\u2019s \\u201cspecial government employee status\\u201d and \\u201calleged that Abedin\\u2019s role at the center of overlapping public and private Clinton worlds created the potential for conflicts of interest.\\u201dThe Post noted that the State Department\\u2019s Inspector General investigated Abedin last year and \\u201cconcluded she was overpaid nearly $10,000 because of violations of sick leave and vacation policies, a finding that Abedin and her attorneys have contested.\\u201dThe Clinton Foundation\\u2014and Clinton\\u2019s campaign\\u2014came under fire after mainstream media outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Daily Beast, the New Yorker, and Bloomberg confirmed Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer\\u2019s reporting in his best-selling book,\\u00a0Clinton Cash, about mega donors to the Clinton Foundation getting favorable deals from Clinton\\u2019s State Department.The Post pointed out that Clinton denied a report last month that indicated that the \\u201cFBI had expanded its probe to include ties between the foundation and the State Department,\\u201d saying the report was \\u201can unsourced, irresponsible\\u201d claim with \\u201cno basis.\\u201dThough Clinton has also brushed off the broader FBI investigation into her emails, recently saying that she was \\u201cabsolutely\\u201d confident nothing would come of it, author Ed Klein told Breitbart News Daily last week that Abedin, along with two other Clinton aides\\u2014Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan\\u2014have lawyered up because they face potential jail time due to Clinton\\u2019s email scandal. Klein said FBI Director James Comey is taking the investigation very seriously because he thinks it will define his legacy and mentioned that the agency is trying to get one of Clinton\\u2019s allies to \\u201cturn on Hillary\\u2026 in order to save their own skin.\\u201dAccording to the Post, \\u201cthe full scope and status of the inquiry\\u201d of the State Department\\u2019s investigation \\u201cwere not clear from the material correspondence\\u201d that it reviewed. The State Department and representatives of Hillary Clinton\\u2019s campaign and Huma Abedin did not comment for the report.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
