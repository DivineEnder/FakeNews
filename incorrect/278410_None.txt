"{\"article_id\": 278410, \"content\": \"The Polanski divide isn\\u2019t a left/right issue, it\\u2019s a culture issue, and while there are many good and moral people  working in the entertainment industry, there\\u2019s also  a dark underbelly of money, power, sex and fame among the most powerful. They\\u2019re terrified to  judge Polanski because they don\\u2019t want to open that door. If \\u201cjudgment\\u201d is allowed in the room, it could turn on them.\\n\\nThe worst sin imaginable among the Harvey Weinsteins who run this town and the Whoopi Goldbergs  desperate to hold on to their celebrity, obviously isn\\u2019t the sodomizing a thirteen year-old child. The worst sin is making a moral judgment against another \\u2014 unless that \\u201cother\\u201d is someone who makes them ashamed through the upholding of   a personal moral standard, like a Christian.

But they\\u2019re \\u201call in,\\u201d and even the Eugene Robinsons of the world can\\u2019t believe their eyes:\\n\\nMore than 100 movie-business heavyweights \\u2014 including directors Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Mike Nichols and Pedro Almod?var \\u2014 have signed a petition calling on Swiss authorities to set Polanski free. Piling chutzpah upon gall, Woody Allen is among the petitioners. You will recall that Allen shocked non-Hollywood sensibilities by acknowledging his romance with Soon-Yi Previn, the daughter of Allen\\u2019s longtime companion, Mia Farrow. At the time, Allen was 56 and Previn was 21.Actress, comedian and \\u201cThe View\\u201d co-host Whoopi Goldberg has come under well-justified fire for making a jaw-dropping statement about Polanski\\u2019s crime: \\u201cI know it wasn\\u2019t rape-rape. I think it was something else, but I don\\u2019t believe it was rape-rape.\\u201dReally?Read the full piece here.\", \"title\": \"When You've Lost Eugene Robinson: 'Hollywood's Shame'\", \"source_id\": 2}"
