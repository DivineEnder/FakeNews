"{\"title\": \"SPLC Claims Ongoing FBI Relationship\", \"content\": \"The Southern Poverty Law Center claims they are still in the good graces of the FBI and that reports the FBI has severed ties are false.Heidi Beirich, Director of SPLC\\u2019s Intelligence Project told Breitbart News that she does not know why links to SPLC were taken down from the FBI site.\\nBeirich said, \\u201cAll of the resource organizations were pulled, as you can see. The FRC claims we are behind domestic terrorism and that\\u2019s why the FBI took us down\\u2013I\\u2019m supposing that doesn\\u2019t relate to the ADL or anyone else that was up there.\\u201d Beirich provided no other confirmation her group has an ongoing relationship with the FBI.\\u00a0A spokesman for the Family Research Council told Breitbart News the information about SPLC on the FBI site are historical in nature and the fact remains that the FBI has scrubbed SPLC\\u2019s website from theirs and that you can no longer access SPLC\\u2019s hate list through the FBI site.\\u00a0\\u00a0The two mentions of SPLC that remain on the FBI site include a link to a 2007 partnership looking into cold cases from the civil rights battles of the 1960s:\\u201cIn February 2007, the FBI and the Department of Justice announced a partnership with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Urban League to help investigate these aging unsolved murders. At the time, Director Robert Mueller said, \\u2018We will do everything we can to close those cases and to close this dark chapter in our nation\\u2019s history.'\\u201d \\u00a0The other refers to SPLC still having a public outreach role with the FBI.\\u201cPublic Outreach: The FBI has forged partnerships nationally and locally with many civil rights organizations to establish rapport, share information, address concerns, and cooperate in solving problems. These groups include such organizations as the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League, the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, the National Organization for Women, the Human Rights Campaign, and the National Disability Rights Network.\\u201dWhen asked to provide confirmation that SPLC keeps an ongoing formal relationship with the FBI, Beirich said, \\u201cOur CEO works with the cold case office. He was at the press conference announcing the event\\u2013you can probably find that online. That is described on the FBI page.\\u201d She also stated, \\u201cWe have frequent contact with FBI agents on a whole range of issues and we\\u2019ve trained them in the past. I\\u2019m not sure exactly the last time we talked with an FBI agent and our LE trainers are not in the office today.\\u201d\\u00a0The press conference likely refers to an event seven years ago.In a statement just released, General Jerry Boykin of FRC still claims victory: \\u201cWhat we have been concerned about is that the FBI had provided links to the SPLC website as though it were an authentic source.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u201cThe SPLC\\u2019s history with the FBI is undeniable and can be found on the FBI website.  The fact that there are no longer links to the SPLC website is exactly what we asked for in our correspondence with the FBI,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cThe SPLC\\u2019s link to domestic terrorism was established in federal court and can also be found with just a little research.  This is not about history but about using SPLC\\u2019s data which is specious and dangerous.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 284433}"
