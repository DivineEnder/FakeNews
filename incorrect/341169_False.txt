Jay Nixon told cheering union workers that he would fight to preserve a bedrock of labor organizing: the right to require workers, including those who opt out of joining a union, to pay dues or their equivalent.\\\",\\\"But even as Mr. Nixon, a Democrat, branded attacks on the policy \\u201cdivisive and dangerous,\\u201d many Republicans in Missouri\\u2019s General Assembly, with the support of business groups like the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, were formulating a plan to change the law and make this the 26th state to enact what they call a \\u201cright to work\\u201d policy.\\\",\\\"The battle will reach its climax Wednesday, when the Republican-dominated General Assembly is expected to try to override Mr. Nixon\\u2019s veto of a bill that would allow workers who choose not to join a union to avoid paying fees.\\\",\\\"Though Republicans hold a substantial majority in both houses of the Assembly, their caucus has not been unanimous in supporting the policy, and organized labor remains strong enough in Missouri to make the outcome of the vote uncertain.\\\",\\\"State Representative Eric Burlison, who sponsored the legislation and says it would draw new businesses to Missouri, said he was \\u201coptimistic\\u201d about getting the veto overturned but stopped far short of forecasting a victory. Union leaders said they were hopeful that the veto would hold up.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI would say this is completely up in the air,\\u201d said Mr. Burlison, a Republican from Springfield. \\u201cBut I feel no matter what happens that we\\u2019re making progress.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The right-to-work policy has become law in Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan \\u2014 states with Republican governors and Republican-controlled legislatures \\u2014 in recent years despite vocal objections from organized labor. The bill has been introduced a number of times in Missouri, but only this year made it to the desk of Mr. Nixon, whose veto had been widely expected.\\\",\\\"Supporters of the legislation say it would attract businesses to the state and prevent nonunion workers from paying for union services they do not want. But union leaders say the existing law allowing them to charge fees to nonunion workers is fair because all workers benefit from collective bargaining. They say revoking that right would weaken unions, some of which are already struggling to maintain membership and political clout.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWithout these unions in the state, you\\u2019re not going to make what you should,\\u201d said Josh Weeks, a union carpenter from Meta, Mo., who was in the audience for Mr. Nixon\\u2019s speech. \\u201cIn my opinion, if you want to be in a right-to-work state, you should move to one.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The override effort will hinge on whether supporters of the legislation can persuade enough Republicans who sided with the unions during the regular session to join their cause. Two-thirds majorities are needed in both chambers to overturn Mr. Nixon\\u2019s veto. The House vote in May fell 17 votes short of that mark.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe large group of Republicans who have supported working families in the state of Missouri are the reason we\\u2019re not right to work today,\\u201d said Albert L. Bond, assistant executive secretary-treasurer of the Carpenters\\u2019 District Council of Greater St. Louis and Vicinity.\\\",\\\"But it remains unclear what effect months of lobbying have had.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI know we\\u2019ve flipped some,\\u201d said Greg Mourad, a vice president at the National Right to Work Committee, which supports the legislation. \\u201cWhether we\\u2019ve flipped enough or not, I guess we\\u2019ll just have to wait and find out.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Missouri, whose union footprint has decreased in recent decades as manufacturing jobs have moved abroad, is increasingly rare as a Midwestern state without a right-to-work law. Of the states it borders, all but Illinois and Kentucky have some version of the policy on the books. Mr. Mourad said that puts Missouri at a disadvantage when competing with its neighbors to attract a new factory or business.\\\",\\\"Mr. Nixon rejected that argument during his speech here, and predicted that laborers would have inferior training and that safety standards would erode if the bill became law. Mr. Nixon suggested that the union-supported training center where he spoke, a place where aspiring carpenters spend years learning their craft, could be among the bill\\u2019s casualties.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAs that union power would erode,\\u201d Mr. Nixon said in an interview, \\u201cyou\\u2019d see less ability to make these longer-term investments.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Whatever happens Wednesday, it seems clear that Missouri\\u2019s discussion of the policy is not going away. If a Republican is elected next year to replace Mr. Nixon, who cannot seek re-election because of term limits, the policy could be much easier to enact. Advocates on both sides of the issue say they plan to hold lawmakers to account for how they vote Wednesday.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt will certainly be a central theme in next year\\u2019s elections in Missouri,\\u201d said Mr. Burlison, who pledged to refile the bill next year if the governor\\u2019s veto is sustained. \\u201cNot just for the governor candidates, but probably every statewide officeholder and every office down ticket from there.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
