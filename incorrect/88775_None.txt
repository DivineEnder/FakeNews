"{\"article_id\": 88775, \"title\": \"Former Romney debate coach: Romney a 'good communicator' overall\", \"content\": \"Former Romney debate coach Brett O'Donnell, appearing on Hardball in advance of tonight's Arizona debate, responded to claims that the former Massachusetts governor is uncomfortable on the stump, saying Romney sometimes \\\"overthinks\\\" his answers but that overall he's a \\\"good communicator.\\\"\\\"At times he overthinks what he\\u2019s trying to say and then that, you know, causes him to parse almost every word because he\\u2019s trying to make sure everything comes out just right and when you do that, when you\\u2019re not going on instinct, when you\\u2019re rather overthinking, then that\\u2019s really the time that things come out wrong,\\\" said O'Donnell, who left the campaign following the last Florida debate last month. \\\"There\\u2019s been times where if he\\u2019s telling stories, if he talks about how he was raised or what he\\u2019s done in his life, those sorts of things, I think that there are times where he\\u2019s comfortable. I think there are also times where he\\u2019s responding to questions or in a moment where he overthinks and isn\\u2019t very comfortable.\\\"And, when asked to respond to an AFSCME ad in which Romney is compared to the \\\"I love lamp\\\" character in \\\"Anchorman,\\\" O'Donnell said the comparison is \\\"overblown.\\\"\\\"Is he the best communicator we\\u2019ve had running for president? No. Is he a good communicator? Absolutely, I think so,\\\" O'Donnell said. \\\"There\\u2019s moments in the debates where he\\u2019s been very, very good. There\\u2019s also been moments where, like everyone, he stumbled. I think sometimes we forget these folks are human, they have to go on the stage every day several times a day and perform. I think there are going to be times where he stumbles.\\\"\", \"source_id\": 1}"
