"{\"title\": \"Caroline Criado-Perez And The Death Of Western Civilization\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Indeed, they will be able to pinpoint its demise down not just to the day but to the very hour the announcement was made. I refer, of course, to the extraordinary Gavrilo-Princip-style moment when some very dangerous and out-of-control mad person somehow got their shaking, sweating hands on the controls and decided it would be a good idea to award an OBE to someone called Caroline Criado Perez.To help future historians I thought I\\u2019d provide a contemporary record of this momentous event using the traditional early 21st century medium of an internet Q & A.Q: So we\\u2019re all very clear now, we historians here in your future, that Western Civilization definitely ended when Caroline Criado Perez was awarded an OBE. But though we\\u2019ve searched our extensive archives, which includes every article written or published, and every tweet ever tweeted \\u2013 including the deleted ones by Johann Hari claiming to have personally transcribed all Shakespeare\\u2019s plays as they were dictated to him by the author \\u2013 we seem quite unable to find anyone by that name of any significance. The only Caroline Criado Perez in our records appears to be some kind of desperate, attention-seeking, political activist cum low-rent blogger.A: Yes. That\\u2019s the one.Q: Then we can only assume that her OBE wasn\\u2019t the OBE but some similarly-named bauble of no significance.A: Er, no. It\\u2019s the OBE. As in Order of the British Empire.Q: Quite impossible! We\\u2019ve studied the history of the British Empire and it was kind of a big deal. We\\u2019ve read about Queen Victoria and Clive of India and the Charge of the Light Brigade and Scott of the Antarctic and Rorke\\u2019s Drift and the White Man\\u2019s Burden and all the incredible economic and scientific and intellectual advances that were made as a result of the money, power and influence which accrued from the Empire where the sun never set. So when you award one of your Queen\\u2019s subjects a medal named the Order of the British Empire that\\u2019s got to be a pretty big deal right? You\\u2019re not going to just hand it over willy nilly, to some hysterical, twittering, publicity-grubbing nobody?A: So the more old-fashioned among us would have hoped, certainly.Q: No. No! You have GOT TO BE JOKING. We know our history, we historians of the future, and one of things we know is that the Beatles \\u2013 who are, only, like, the most famous pop band in the history of the universe \\u2013 when they got their awards they weren\\u2019t even OBEs. They were MBEs. Which is one notch below. You\\u2019re not seriously telling us that between 1965 \\u2013 when John, Paul, George and Ringo got their MBEs \\u2013 and 2015, when Caroline Criado Perez got her OBE, that your culture became so grotesquely debased that some jumped up feminist troll was deemed superior in value and achievement to the creators of Eleanor Rigby, Strawberry Fields Forever, Helter Skelter and (our personal favourite in the future) Octopus\\u2019s Garden? Really?A: Now you\\u2019re beginning to grasp this End of Western Civilization thing.Q: OK. OK. Just to recap, so that we\\u2019re SURE we\\u2019re talking about the same woman. This Caroline Criado Perez\\u2019s most memorable achievement was launching a campaign to get the head of Jane Austen on a banknote. Not because Jane Austen was maybe the greatest novelist in the English language \\u2013 which we could understand \\u2013 but just to make the cheapshot feminist point that Jane Austen had a vagina whereas Dickens and Trollope didn\\u2019t?A: You do sound refreshing un-PC in the future, I must say.Q: Yeah well. We had to change. It was the only way we could start trying to recreate Western Civilization once this Caroline Criado Perez person had killed it. But look, we\\u2019re asking the questions here. We\\u2019re future historians. We NEED TO KNOW because there\\u2019s something about this whole banknote think that has been troubling us. Are we right in thinking that the person on the other side of the banknote was also female?A: Yes. The Queen.Q: But this Caroline Criado Perez felt, what, that was \\u201csexist\\u201d or something? That only total domination of your banknotes by the female sex would do?A: \\u201cGender\\u201d. She would have preferred the term \\u201cgender.\\u201dQ: Crikey, she sounds tiresome.A: I think she would have considered that kind of language patriarchal, phallocentric and dismissive.Q: I bet she would, the minx.A: Wow! I\\u2019m loving this future of ours already.Q: You say that. But you have no idea the horror the planet has to go through in order to get where we are. Fireships off the shoulder of Orion, my arse. We are talking ugly, ugly, ugly. Mind you, having said that, nothing quite as ugly as the awarding of the OBE to this annoying uber-talentless rabblerousing flibbertigibbet. Which is why I\\u2019ve got one more important question for you.A: Go on.Q: Well, it\\u2019s like this. Our records show that when the Beatles got their MBEs many earlier recipients of the award were so disgusted that they handed their gongs back in protest. Yet, we seem to have no evidence that Caroline Criado Perez\\u2019s OBE provoked a similar outbreak of high principle.A: So your question is what exactly?Q: Well it\\u2019s more of a rhetorical one, really. What can have happened to your culture that it became so vapid, spineless and worthless so quickly? Since when did you become so obsessed with this \\u201cequality\\u201d crap that it was allowed to trump all the things that once made Western Civilization great: your history, your traditions, your values, your heroic achievements, your quest for truth, beauty, wisdom, excellence?\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"article_id\": 136142}"
