"{\"title\": \"White House wants 'definitive' case before acting in Syria\", \"content\": \"White House press secretary Jay Carney maintained Friday that the administration needs more evidence -- facts that can be \\\"corroborated, reviewed and verified\\\"\\u00a0 -- to make a \\\"definitive judgment\\\" that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons.He said U.S. officials are working with allies and the Syrian opposition to establish such things as the \\\"chain of custody\\\" of the samples that showed sarin gas had been used -- ensuring they weren't tampered with. The White House said Thursday that the intelligence community has assessed \\\"with varying degress of confidence\\\" and partly based on those tests that the gas had been used.\\\"We are working to establish credible and corroborated facts to build on this intelligence assessment in order to establish a definitive judgment as to whether or not the president\\u2019s red line has been crossed and to inform our decision-making about next steps,\\\" Carney said.He declined to speculate on what those next steps might be, repeating his earlier statements that \\\"all options are on the table,\\\" and he wouldn't put a timetable on the fact-finding mission.\\\"The president wants the facts, and I'm not going to set a timeline, because the facts need to be what drives this investigation, not a deadline,\\\" Carney said.He alluded to lessons learned in Iraq, where erroneous intelligence assessments had indicated Saddam Hussein had acquired weapons of mass destruction. But he said even if that hadn't happened, Obama's being deliberate and looking for additional information is the \\\"responsible thing to do\\\" and is not a reflection of any doubts about the intelligence assessments about Syria.\\\"He has enormous faith in our intelligence community, but he also believes that the proper use of intelligence in a case like this is to have it be a component of, but not the only souce of, your decision-making process,\\\" Carney said. \\\"...It's important just to acknowledge that assessments are not, they're based in part on facts, but they're not soley facts. They're the judgments of professionals. They are not in and of themselves policy decisions.Those, Carney said, are made by the president, \\\"and he or she makes them based on, should make them based on, a broad array of information.\\\"\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 43241}"
