Rand Paul brought his outreach campaign to Howard University on Wednesday, giving skeptical students a lesson in the positive history of the Republican Party and the African-American community.At one of the nation\\u2019s oldest black schools , Paul (R-Ky.) insisted under questioning that he \\u201chas never wavered\\u201d in his support of the 1964 Civil Rights Act \\u2014 an issue that dogged his 2010 Senate campaign after he questioned the act in a televised interview.\\u201cNo Republican questions or disputes civil rights,\\u201d Paul said Wednesday. \\u201cI\\u2019ve never wavered in my support for civil rights or the Civil Rights Act.\\u201d He added that he does \\u201cquestion some of the ramifications\\u201d of the act on business.( PHOTOS: Rand Paul\\u2019s career)But overall, the students were unmoved by the Kentucky senator\\u2019s plea to give the GOP a chance. \\u201cHe just focused on the past rather than tell us what the party will do for us now,\\u201d said Felicyana Lowery, a sophomore marketing major. \\u201cI need to know what they have in store for my future.\\u201d\\u201cAll his examples were from 100 years ago,\\u201d said Brendon Patterson, an economic major from Chicago. \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t moved.\\u201dPaul, who told POLITICO that he is seriously looking at the 2016 presidential race, has been reaching out to minorities to expand support beyond his conservative tea party base. The last Republicans to address students at the school was former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele in 2009, and before that Colin Powell in 1994.( Also on POLITICO: Rand Paul considering 2016 run)\\u201cHere I am today at Howard University, a historically black college \\u2026some have said that either I\\u2019m brave or crazy to be here today,\\u201d Paul said. \\u201cMy hope is that you hear me out and see me for who I am and not as a caricature put forward by political opponents. \\u201cI can stumbles into the areas \\u2014 I may stumble and fall but at least I can try.\\u201dPaul went on to then describe the GOP\\u2019s rich Civil-War era history with the emancipation of slaves, and assailed the Southern Democrats of the era for discrimination. \\u201cHow did we lose the support of an entire race?\\u201d he asked \\u201cHow did we lose that vote?\\u201dPaul disputed the suggestion that Republicans sanctioned voter suppression in states where GOP legislatures passed voter ID laws. One student accused the measures of targeting the poor, seniors and minority voters. \\u201cI think if you liken using a driver\\u2019s license to a literacy test you demean the horror of what happened in the 40s and 50s. It was horrific. No one is in favor of that,\\u201d Paul said. \\u201cBut showing your driver\\u2019s license to have an honest election is not unreasonable.\\u201dHe did stumble at one point when he couldn\\u2019t recall the name of the first African American elected to the Senate, and was prompted by students shouting \\u201cEdward Brooke.\\u201d At another point he asked whether they knew that the founders of the NAACP were Republicans. Groans could be head and one student shouted ,\\u201cWe know our history!\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1}"
