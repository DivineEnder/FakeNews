"{\"title\": \"Iran: Confronting U.S. Is Only Choice Left\", \"content\": \"The remarks came following legislation proposed by U.S. opponents to the Iran deal to further sanction the Islamic Republic, and the UN\\u2019s first bi-annual report, which said that Iran was not following the \\u201cspirit\\u201d of the nuclear agreement signed last year by continuing ballistic missile tests.\\u201cMajlis (Iranian Parliament), utterly regretting the UN chief\\u2019s move, is warning the US administration and its House of Representatives and Senate that injurious measures against the nuclear agreement have reached such a point that there is no way left for Iran but to counteract,\\u201d the Jerusalem Post, citing Iran\\u2019s Press TV, quotes Larijani as stating.Regarding the UN report, Larijani said, \\u201cOn the one hand, the Secretary General says in his report that Iran\\u2019s commitment is encouraging, and on the other, he makes no reference to Iran\\u2019s concerns and complaints about the non-implementation of all of the P5+1\\u2019s obligations.\\u201dLarijani charged the Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon of a one-sided approach, asking, \\u201cHad the Secretary General been tasked with producing a report on both sides\\u2019 fulfillment of their obligations or is he the P5+1\\u2019s monitor in this?\\u201dLarijani argued that testing ballistic missiles is not prohibited in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal itself. He further countered that the treaty makes no mention of UN Security Council Resolution 2231.According to Larijani, Iran was only instructed not to design ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\\u201cHas Iran designed any such thing? Why would the UN chief then declare that the spirit of the JCPOA has been violated?\\u201d Press TV quoted Larijani as asking.According to the report, Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi warned Wednesday that if the U.S.-led JCPOA continues to disrespect the deal, Iran will resume uranium enrichment to a greater extent than it did before the treaty.\\u201cWe can go to better conditions compared with the past as quickly as possible,\\u201d Salehi was quoted as saying by Iran\\u2019s Fars News Agency.\\u201cOf course, this will happen if the other side violates the nuclear deal and this violation will be confirmed by the board (in Iran) which supervises (implementation of) the nuclear deal.\\u201d he added.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 302698}"
