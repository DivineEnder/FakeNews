"{\"title\": \"EXCLUSIVE: Lies Revealed -- Greenpeace Leader Admits Arctic Ice Exaggeration\", \"content\": \"The outgoing leader of Greenpeace has admitted his organization\\u2019s recent claim that the Arctic Ice will disappear by 2030 was \\u201ca mistake.\\u201d   Greenpeace made the claim in a July 15 press release entitled \\u201cUrgent Action Needed As Arctic Ice Melts,\\u201d which said there will be an ice-free Arctic by 2030 because of global warming.  Under close questioning by BBC reporter Stephen Sackur on the \\u201cHardtalk\\u201d program, Gerd Leipold, the retiring leader of Greenpeace, said the claim was wrong.  \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it will be melting by 2030. \\u2026 That may have been a mistake,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n[youtube NC7bE9jopXE nolink]\\n\\u2014Sackur said the claim was inaccurate on two fronts, pointing out that the Arctic ice is a  mass of 1.6 million square kilometers with a thickness of 3 km in the middle, and that it had survived much warmer periods in history than the present.  The BBC reporter accused Leipold and Greenpeace of releasing \\u201cmisleading information\\u201d and using \\u201cexaggeration and alarmism.\\u201d  Leipold\\u2019s admission that Greenpeace issued misleading information is a major embarrassment to the organization, which often has been accused of alarmism but has always insisted that it applies full scientific rigor in its global-warming pronouncements.  Although he admitted Greenpeace had released inaccurate but alarming information, Leipold defended the organization\\u2019s practice of \\u201cemotionalizing issues\\u201d in order to bring the public around to its way of thinking and alter public opinion.  Leipold said later in the BBC interview that there is an urgent need for the suppression of economic growth in the United States and around the world. He said annual growth rates of 3 percent to 8 percent cannot continue without serious consequences for the climate.  \\u201cWe will definitely have to move to a different concept of growth. \\u2026 The lifestyle of the rich in the world is not a sustainable model,\\u201d Leipold said. \\u201cIf you take the lifestyle, its cost on the environment, and you multiply it with the billions of people and an increasing world population, you come up with numbers which are truly scary.\\u201d  (You can watch the full BBC interview with Leipold here, and to learn more about Greenpeace-style global warming hysteria and its potential toll on the American dream, go to www.noteviljustwrong.com, the Web site for the forthcoming documentary \\u201cNot Evil Just Wrong,\\u201d by Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinney.)\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 278856}"
