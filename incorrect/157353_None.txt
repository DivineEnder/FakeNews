The island of Manhattan, New York, and Washington, D.C., have been described as secondary targets for a preemptive nuclear strike on the part of Pyongyang.This statement reiterated statements in North Korean media months before expressing dictator Kim Jong-un\\u2019s desire to\\u00a0\\u201cscorch the Cheong wa Dae [presidential palace] bossed by Park Geun-hye in a jiffy.\\u201d\\u00a0The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), a state media operation, said in March, \\u201cAll the service personnel and people of the DPRK are ready to immediately and mercilessly punish without slightest leniency, tolerance and patience anyone provoking the dignified supreme headquarters even a bit.\\u201dIn addition to these threats, North Korean television published a video in March depicting a nuclear blast over Manhattan and Washington, D.C., as well as the Cheongwadae. That video warned,\\u00a0\\u201cIf\\u00a0the American imperialists provoke us a bit, we will not hesitate to slap them with a pre-emptive nuclear strike.\\u201dThe new threat against South Korea\\u2019s executive headquarters comes as South Korean intelligence officials confirm the second failed North Korean missile launch of the week. On Thursday, Kim Jong-un\\u2019s military attempted to launch what officials identified as a \\u201cMusudan intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM),\\u201d but failed, the missile crashing to the ground within minutes.\\u00a0\\u201cIt is highly likely that the launch failed. With that in mind, South Korea and the United States are conducting a detailed assessment,\\u201d a South Korean \\u201cinsider\\u201d told Yonhap.\\u201cWe strongly condemn these and North Korea\\u2019s other recent missile tests, which violate multiple U.N. Security Council Resolutions explicitly prohibiting North Korea from conducting launches using ballistic missile technology,\\u201d\\u00a0American\\u00a0State Department spokesperson Katina Adams told Yonhap following the second missile launch.In its media Thursday, North Korea accused South Korea of attempting to start forest fires within its borders. According to an article in state newspaper\\u00a0Rodong Sinmun, \\u201cBalloons containing inflammable materials, timers and electric detonating devices were recently discovered in forests of Mt. Kumgang area, including Namae-ri and Onjong-ri of Kosong County, Kangwon Province and Hanwol-ri of Anak County, South Hwanghae Province.\\u201d\\u201cIt has been confirmed that these balloons were sent by the south Korean puppet group into areas of the north to set fire to its forests.\\u00a0This is the evil deed which could be perpetrated only by the confrontation maniacs utterly disregarding ethics and the nation,\\u201d the article continues. It provides no photographic or other evidence for the accusation, nor a motive on the part of Seoul for engaging in such behavior.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 157353}"
