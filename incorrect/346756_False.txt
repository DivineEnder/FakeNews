Trumpis heading west this weekend for rallies in Las Vegas and Phoenix and a fund-raiser at Barry Goldwater\\u2019s old estate, known as Be-nun-i-kin, Navajo for \\u201chouse on top of the hill.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But it was the prospect of Mr. Trump\\u2019s gathering with members of theNavajo Nationthat was creating the most intrigue around the trip of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\\\",\\\"Navajo leaders had extended an invitation to Mr. Trump, as they have to other candidates, to meet with them, despite objections from a number of members over hisrepeated use of the name \\u201cPocahontas\\u201dto deride SenatorElizabeth Warrenof Massachusetts. On Friday, Navajo officials said the meeting was not going to happen during Mr. Trump\\u2019s trip.\\\",\\\"Nevertheless, Mr. Trump\\u2019s words have stirred a debate among Native Americans about how they should deal with him. For many, his mention of the historical figure is offensive and a sign that Mr. Trump, who has been accused of being anti-immigrant, also has problems with the people who first inhabited the country.\\\",\\\"This year, the nickname has become Mr. Trump\\u2019s favorite pejorative for punching back at Ms. Warren, a progressive Democrat who is one of hismost vocal critics. In 2012, the former Harvard Law School professor came under fire when it emerged that during her academic career she identified herself as a minority, citing Native American roots.\\\",\\\"\\u201cShe\\u2019s got about as much Indian blood as I have,\\u201dMr. Trump said in March. \\u201cHer whole life was based on a fraud.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In rallies, at news conferences and on Twitter, Mr. Trump has repeatedly called Ms. Warren \\u201cPocahontas\\u201d and \\u201cgoofy.\\u201d Last month, when an indigenous Canadian journalisttold himhis use of the name was rude, Mr. Trump kept repeating it. At some of his campaign events, Mr. Trump\\u2019s supporters chant Indian war cries.\\\",\\\"Native Americans have taken notice.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think he definitely says it as a slur,\\u201d said Jacqueline Pata, executive director of theNational Congress of American Indians. \\u201cNo matter how he feels about Elizabeth Warren, to throw that out there is disrespectful to real Native Americans.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Pata noted that the portrayal of Pocahontas inDisney moviesis a caricature, and that the real Pocahontas has a deep and even painful legacy for Native American tribes such as the Powhatan in Virginia. In Powhatan lore, Pocahontas gained hero status for saving the life of a white man and was later kidnapped by the English; after being held hostage and forced to marry,she died in 1617in England at the age of 21.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s tragic way that she died away from her people and of a disease that was brought by the Europeans,\\u201d saidDebra Haaland, the chairwoman of the New Mexico Democratic Party and a member of the Laguna Pueblo, who takes offense at Mr. Trump\\u2019s use of the name. \\u201cIt discredits her memory,\\u201d she said.\\\",\\\"For Ms. Haaland, using the term \\u201cPocahontas\\u201d is like calling Native Americans \\u201cRedskins,\\u201d and it suggests that Mr. Trump thinks that all tribes are the same.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s as if any person who identifies as native, \\u2018We\\u2019ll just call them Pocahontas,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Haaland said.\\\",\\\"Some Native Americans have felt the wrath of Mr. Trump before. As a casino mogul in the 1990s, Mr. Trump sued the federal government, arguing that allowing tribes to open casinosdiscriminated against him.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis guy is unbelievable,\\u201d George Schneider, a lawyer who represented 2,000 Ramapoughs in northern New Jersey and New York, said at the time.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHis father hands him a multimillion-dollar empire. The Native American Indians are lucky if they can give their children food, clothing and a roof over their head.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As he has done with Ms. Warren, Mr. Trump also questioned whether the casino operators benefiting from their Native American status were pure blooded.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey don\\u2019t look like Indians to me,\\u201d Mr. Trump said at acongressional hearing in 1993.\\\",\\\"Despite this history, the leaders of the Navajo Nation, who represent about 250,000 tribal members across27,000 square milesin Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, reached out to Mr. Trump in hopes of meeting him during his visit to Arizona.\\\",\\\"But on Friday afternoon Jared Touchin, a spokesman for the Navajo Nation, said the meeting would not take place because of \\u201cprior obligations\\u201d of the Navajo Nation leadership.\\\",\\\"Mr. Touchin acknowledged that some tribal members were not interested in having their leaders meet with Mr. Trump after his recent remarks. But he said that many members thought it would be valuable to talk to him about education, water rights, tribal sovereignty and coal.\\\",\\\"The Navajo Nation relies heavily on the struggling coal industry for revenue, and reviving it could be an area of potential partnership with Mr. Trump, who has vowed to put miners back to work.\\\",\\\"Carlyle W. Begay, a Republican state senator who lives on the Navajo Nation, said that he hoped to meet Mr. Trump so that he could help educate him about how to more appropriately talk about Native American issues.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe term that he used should be changed,\\u201d Mr. Begay said. \\u201cHe should use a different rhetoric, and this is an opportunity to help him understand that.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Still, not all Navajos are turned off by Mr. Trump\\u2019s tone.\\\",\\\"Shawn Redd, a Navajo Republican who is running for Congress in Arizona, suggested that his fellow Native Americans were being too politically correct and that Ms. Warren deserved to be ridiculed for calling herself a minority.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think Donald Trump is within his full rights to make fun of her for it,\\u201d Mr. Redd said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt is a scandal.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
