"{\"article_id\": 237350, \"content\": \"The book chronicles the slow descent of Germany into Nazi tyranny. One of the most striking features of the narrative is the fear that slowly descends on the German populace as they become terrified of ever expressing an opinion about Hitler and his police state even in the company of close family and friends.Yet Dodd and his family were utterly immune to such fear. Though they lived in a home that was owned by a Jewish banker; though they regularly hosted journalists who wrote critically of Hitler; though they drove by the home of Franz Von Papen \\u2013 the deputy Chancellor \\u2013\\u00a0 to show their support even after he had been placed under house arrest by Hitler for his Marburg speech of June, 1934; though Dodd openly snubbed Hitler every year by refusing to attend the Nazi Nuremberg rally where Hitler was celebrated as a god, Dodd never had anything to fear.\\u00a0He did not have to worry that the SA would ransack his Berlin home in the middle of the night. He did not have to fear that his daughter Martha, who even had an affair with Gestapo head Rudolf Diels, would be summarily shot for her increasing disillusion with Hitler\\u2019s regime. He did not have to fear that the SS would arrest him on his frequent walks through the Tiergarten for a speech he gave on that made subtle reference to Hitler\\u2019s growing assault on freedom. And he did not have fear that roaming bands of Nazi thugs would attack him for his protests to the German Foreign Minister against unprovoked attacks that threatened the lives of Americans.And why didn\\u2019t he fear? Because even a monster as evil as Hitler, arguably the most dangerous man that ever lived, wasn\\u2019t going to mess with the American Ambassador.In fact, one of the stories told in the book is the day that Dodd took a walk with French Ambassador\\u00a0Andr\\u00e9 Fran\\u00e7ois-Poncet\\u00a0in the Tiergarten when the latter told him he would not be surprised if he would be shot in the street by the SS.Dodd was astonished. It never occurred to him to ever worry so long as he was the American Ambassador, and indeed Hitler and the Nazis never harassed Western Ambassadors.It therefore matters that just 80 years later, a bunch of terrorist thugs can think they can murder an American Ambassador in full sight of the world without consequence. American diplomatic staff were once the safest people in the world, representatives of a superpower who would rain hell from the skies should you touch one of their diplomatic staff. But no more.The growing revelations from the Congressional hearings on Benghazi, that the Obama State Department watered down public statements on the attack in order to cleanse them of any mention of Al Qaida and terrorism, is a travesty and shows a lack of moral will to give evil its proper name.\\u00a0ABC News and Fox News reported this past Friday that the department\\u2019s talking points were revised a full 12 times to purge them of any mention of terrorism. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland asked the CIA to remove mention of their own security warnings about Benghazi.\\u00a0According to ABC News, the original paragraph read, \\u201cThe Agency has produced numerous pieces on the threat of extremists linked to Al Qaida in Benghazi and eastern Libya. These noted that, since April, there have been at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants, including the June attack against the British Ambassador\\u2019s convoy. We cannot rule out the individuals has previously surveilled the U.S. facilities, also contributing to the efficacy of the attacks.\\u201d\\u00a0But Nuland was concerned that the line \\u201ccould be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either?\\u201dI have earlier written how Ambassador Susan Rice was utterly inappropriate to be chosen as Secretary of State based on her efforts to disassociate the word \\u201cgenocide\\u201d from the Rwandan mass slaughters of 1994 so as not to commit the Clinton Administration to intervention.\\u00a0In a 2001 article published in The Atlantic, Samantha Power, author of the Pulitzer-Prize winning\\u00a0A Problem of Hell\\u00a0and arguably the world\\u2019s foremost voice against genocide and who currently serves on the National Security Council as an aide to President Obama, referred to Ambassador Susan Rice and her colleagues in the Clinton Administration as \\u201cBystanders to Genocide.\\u201d She quotes Rice in the 2002 book as saying,\\u00a0\\u201cIf we use the word \\u2018genocide\\u2019 and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November congressional election?\\u201d Rice\\u2019s subordination of a human tragedy of epic proportions to partisan politic interests mirrors the current allegations of denying a terror attack in Benghazi for political gain.Worse, the attempt to whitewash the Benghazi attacks as merely a protest that turned violent trivializes the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and the three Americans murdered with him and threatens to cheapen the life of every American diplomat currently serving in dangerous posts. We need to accept that the fear the United States once instilled in those with evil intent against our diplomatic staff has worn thin, and the only way to reintroduce that fear is to understand fully what happened in Benghazi and rain fire on the culprits so that this never happens again.Shmuley Boteach, whom\\u00a0The Washington Post\\u00a0calls \\u2018the most famous Rabbi in America,\\u2019 served as Rabbi to the students of Oxford University for 11 years where he created the\\u00a0Oxford L\\u2019Chaim Society,\\u00a0which hosted world leaders lecturing on values-based leadership.
