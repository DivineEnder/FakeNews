The captain of the ship reportedly admitted to being present in the waters illegally and claimed that his cargo was intended to refuel ships navigating in the area. The ship reportedly lacked any work permits to conduct its business.Vietnam\\u2019s\\u00a0An Ninh Th\\u1ee7 D\\u00f4\\u00a0newspaper reports\\u00a0the ships the\\u00a0Qiong Yangpu\\u00a0claims it was in the region to serve were also present in Vietnamese waters illegally. Vietnam\\u2019s state news agency\\u00a0reported that\\u00a0\\u201cthe captain of the vessel admitted the oil was to be sold to other Chinese boats which were fishing illegally in Vietnam\\u2019s waters.\\u201d The oil aboard the ship, meanwhile, remains \\u201cwithout clear origin,\\u201d leading some to question whether the ship\\u2019s crew was\\u00a0operating outside of the margins of Chinese law or acquired the oil through connections in Beijing.Singapore\\u2019s\\u00a0Straits Times describe the arrests\\u00a0as a \\u201crare move\\u201d on Vietnam\\u2019s part, as tensions between the two communist neighbors have run high for years since China imposed its \\u201cnine-dash line\\u201d border, usurping much of the South China Sea. China\\u2019s claims as presented by the nine-dash line overlap with those of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan, and have alarmed countries with claims close to, but not overlapping, with China\\u2019s, such as Indonesia.Vietnam claims parts of the highly contested Spratly and Paracel Islands where, two years ago, China began\\u00a0constructing a variety of research, surveillance, and military facilities. The Chinese government has imposed its claims in the region by sending its coast guard to keep Vietnamese and Filipino ships out of relevant areas both nations claim fall within their exclusive economic zones. The Chinese Coast Guard has, on multiple occasions, attacked Vietnamese fishing ships operating in the Paracel Islands, on some occasions sinking them. In October 2015, the head of the Quang Ngai regional Fisheries Association, Phan Huy Hoang, described China as becoming \\u201cmore aggressive and brutal\\u201d towards Vietnamese fishermen in recent memory.China\\u2019s actions towards Vietnam have turned public opinion against what was once considered a trustworthy ally, and the typically repressive Vietnamese government has allowed displays of discontent and protests against China\\u2019s intrusions in the region. It has also begun investing heavily in its military. In January, Vietnamese officials announced it would begin deploying its recently purchased fleet of Kilo-class submarines in the region. Vietnam\\u2019s military bought six of these models from Russia in the past two years.The arrest of the\\u00a0Qiong Yangpu crew\\u00a0is the latest such story regarding foreign governments\\u00a0detaining Chinese ships illegally present in their waters. At least three similar incident involving three different states occurred in March. The government of Indonesia arrested the crew of a trespassing Chinese ship and seized the vessel, but was forced to release the ship after Chinese Coast Guard boats began ramming it, forcing the Indonesian officials to choose between freeing the ship or letting it \\u2013 and all the evidence aboard \\u2013 sink. The government of Argentina sunk a Chinese ship illegally present in the South American nation\\u2019s waters last month after it began attacking Argentine Coast Guard vessels. The government of Taiwan, which China does not recognize as a state independent of China, also arrested\\u00a0the crew of a Chinese ship illegally present in its waters.Chinese state media appear not to have responded yet to the\\u00a0Qiong Yangpu\\u00a0incident; Monday\\u00a0is a public holiday in China. State news outlet\\u00a0Xinhua has, instead, published an editorial condemning the government of the Philippines for participating in a joint military exercise with the United States this week. The joint military exercise will be held near the nine-dash line border and will feature 10,000 soldiers, 8500 of them American. In addition to the joint forces, between 80-95 Australian troops are expected to observe, and Japan has sent two destroyers and a submarine to join the coalition, with a total of about 500 Japanese troops involved.\\u201cA provocation so fear-mongering and untimely as such is likely to boomerang on the initiators,\\u201d a scathing column in\\u00a0Xinhua\\u00a0warns the coalition, describing Filipino officials\\u2019 assertions that China is not the target of the exercise as a \\u201cmalicious misrepresentation\\u201d and warned that such exercises \\u201chave fanned fears and disturbed the tranquility of the South China Sea.\\u201d\", \"title\": \"South China Sea: Vietnam Seizes Trespassing Chinese Ship Carrying Mystery Oil\", \"source_id\": 2}"
