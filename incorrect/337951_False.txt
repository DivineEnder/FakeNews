It mixes a social atmosphere and top-level bridge.\\\",\\\"This year\\u2019s event was held Feb. 28-March 1 at the Royal Automobile Club.\\\",\\\"Ten teams played a round robin with 48 victory points available in each nine-board match. There were 30 victory points from the international match point score and 18 (two per deal) from board-a-match (win-loss) scoring.\\\",\\\"The winners were the England Open team: David Bakhshi, David Gold, Tony Forrester and Andy Robson. They finished almost one match ahead of the de Botton team (Janet de Botton, Artur Malinowski, Nick Sandqvist, Tom Townsend, Thor Erik Hoftaniska and Dror Padon).\\\",\\\"The diagramed deal occurred during the match between these teams.\\\",\\\"In the given auction, Robson (North) opened one club, which was a balanced hand with 11 to 14 or 18 to 19 points, or a 4-4-4-1 with four clubs, or natural with five-plus clubs. Forrester (South) responded one diamond, which showed four or more hearts. (He would have revealed longer diamonds first only with game-forcing values.) Two diamonds was a reverse, indicating four-plus diamonds, longer clubs and at least a good 17 high-card points. Four diamonds promised excellent trump support. Four no-trump was Roman Key Card Blackwood, the reply showing one key card (an ace or the diamond king).\\\",\\\"Malinowski (West) led a low spade against six diamonds. Forrester won with dummy\\u2019s ace, played a trump to his king, cashed his club jack, overtook his diamond jack with dummy\\u2019s ace (which drew trumps) and ran the clubs, discarding two spades and two hearts. He conceded one heart and claimed his contract.\\\",\\\"At the other table, after Hoftaniska (North) had opened one club and rebid two diamonds, Padon (South) raised only to three diamonds. When North continued with three no-trump, South jumped to five diamonds, no doubt hoping his partner would take this as showing strong diamonds, but North passed.\\\",\\\"The contract made with an overtrick, but the England Open team gained 13 imps and the 2 board-a-match points.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
