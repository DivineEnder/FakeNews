Hillary Rodham Clinton and other Democrats have called for efforts to stop what they call price gouging by drug makers. Senior House Democrats are forming a panel to explore possible legislation on drug pricing.\\\",\\\"Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said Tuesday that she would hold a daylong conference on Nov. 20 to consider ways of speeding up the discovery of innovative drug treatments while making them more affordable.\\\",\\\"In an invitation to the forum, the government said: \\u201cIn general, the development of new, innovative medicines has been good for both patients and our economy. However, the high and growing cost of drugs has created hardship for families, employers and states. Specialty medications represent only 1 percent of all prescriptions but, in 2014, these medications resulted in over 31 percent of all drug spending.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Burwell sent the invitation to pharmaceutical executives, patients\\u2019 advocates, doctors and hospital executives, employers, insurance carriers and state officials. Participants, she said, will discuss proposals to increase access to prescription drugs, reduce costs, encourage innovation and promote competition among makers of traditional drugs and biotechnology medicines.\\\",\\\"The agenda makes no mention of price controls, but the program is scheduled to begin with a panel on \\u201cthe impact of rising pharmaceutical costs.\\u201d The federal government pays some of those costs throughMedicareandMedicaid, the programs for older Americans, people with disabilities and those with low incomes.\\\",\\\"Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said the forum would focus on \\u201can incredibly important issue.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe have a broken market for drugs,\\u201d said Dr. Bach, a frequent critic of pricing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. \\u201cUnconstrained price increases are being translated into unaffordable out-of-pocket costs for patients. Patients are not taking medicines that would help them because we can\\u2019t figure out how to get drugs priced according to their value.\\u201d\\\",\\\"New drugs to treat cancer, including some that are highly effective, often cost more than $50,000 or even $100,000 a year. Effective new drugs to treat hepatitis C can cost up to $1,000 a pill, though in recent months purchasers have often been able to negotiate significant discounts.\\\",\\\"Consumer groups and many hospital executives have complained about recent large increases in the cost of some generic drugs that have been on the market for years.\\\",\\\"In his budget request in February, President Obama asked Congress to let Medicare officials negotiate prices with drug manufacturers \\u2014 a practice forbidden by current law. Republicans, though concerned about projected increases in Medicare spending, have resisted efforts to allow the government to negotiate or regulate drug prices.\\\",\\\"At the same time, Mr. Obama proposed a major new initiative to develop drugs tailored to the genetic characteristics of individual patients. The \\u201cprecision medicine\\u201d initiative, led by the National Institutes of Health, has received bipartisan support in Congress. If it succeeds, it could lead to many more high-cost medications, like those already available to treat some forms of cancer and cystic fibrosis.\\\",\\\"The pharmaceutical industry has opposed government price-setting for prescription drugs and has challenged the view that drugs fuel the growth of national health spending.\\\",\\\"\\u201cEven with new treatments and cures for hepatitis C, high cholesterol and cancer, spending on retail prescription medicines is projected to remain approximately 10 percent of U.S. health care spending through 2024, the same percentage as in 1960,\\u201d said Robert E. Zirkelbach, a spokesman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the lobby for drug makers. He added that in the last two decades, the death rate from cancer has fallen 22 percent, thanks in part to new medicines.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
