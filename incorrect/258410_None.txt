"{\"title\": \"Serial Liar Susan Rice Snubs Israel--Again\", \"content\": \"In 2009, during a critical debate at the UN General Assembly over the defamatory Goldstone Report, which accused Israel (falsely) of war crimes and crimes against humanity, Rice absented herself from proceedings, leaving a deputy to read the Obama administration\\u2019s rather weak statement of opposition. Her pressing appointment? Taping the Jon Stewart Show, during which she touted Obama\\u2019s policies of \\u201cengagement.\\u201d\\u00a0Rice was also absent from the UN Security Council in 2011 when the U.S. opposed Palestinian efforts to declare statehood at the United Nations, once more sending a deputy to do the hard work of standing up for America\\u2019s closest ally. Rice\\u2019s only defense is that she has a pattern of absenteeism\\u2013missing, among many other events, the critically important first UN Security Council meeting on Libya in February 2011.In addition, Rice has a history of dishonest spin on behalf of her boss. During the 2008 elections, she was trotted out to deny\\u2013against the plain evidence\\u2013that then-Senator Obama had pledged to meet with the leaders of hostile nations, including Iran, without preconditions. Obama\\u2019s own website at the time said that he supported \\u201cdirect presidential diplomacy with Iran without preconditions.\\u201d Rice blamed right-wing spin.If President Obama wins re-election, Rice is the likely to be the next Secretary of State\\u2013a post she coveted but that she had to yield in the post-primary deal-making between the Obama and Clinton campaigns. She has treated her duties at the UN with disdain as she runs out the clock to 2013. Yet her specific neglect of Israel at a critical and dangerous time also reflects the failing foreign policy of the Obama administration.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 258410}"
