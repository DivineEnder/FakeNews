A lower-ranking judge authorised a \\u201cwide ranging\\u201d inquiry forcing local authority social services staff to begin investigations.Justice Hayden said \\u201cflares of concern\\u201d for the boy\\u2019s wellbeing had been raised by a \\u201cwhole raft of multi-disciplinary agencies\\u201d, and that he couldn\\u2019t understand why social services had \\u201cdisregarded so summarily\\u201d those concerns.He said social services staff had \\u201cmoved into wholesale acceptance that [the boy] should be regarded as a girl\\u201d. He called on council to undertake a review of the \\u201csocial work response\\u201d to the case; a council spokesperson said a review was already underway.The judge considered evidence from boy\\u2019s parents, local authority social workers and a psychologist to make his ruling.In his ruling, Justice Hayden said that the boy\\u2019s mother \\u201ctold me that [he] was \\u2018living in stealth\\u2019 by which was meant, she explained, that he was living life entirely as a girl.\\u201cHe dressed, at all times, like a girl and, it transpired, had been registered at a new general practitioner\\u2019s as a girl.\\u201cI was also left in no doubt that [the mother] was absolutely convinced that [the boy] perceived himself as a girl.\\u201dJustice Hayden added that his \\u201coverwhelming impression\\u201d was that the mother \\u201cbelieves herself to be to fighting for [her son\\u2019s] right to express himself as a girl\\u201d.The woman had told him that the boy \\u201cexpressed disdain for his penis\\u201d, he said, adding: \\u201cI consider that [the mother] has caused significant emotional harm to [her son] in her active determination that he should be a girl.\\u201dJustice Hayden commented upon the fact that the boy had settled in well with his father and his father\\u2019s partner, actively choosing, with no pressure from either adult, to pursue interests typically seen as masculine.\\u201cI have been told that [the father] and his partner were shocked when they first saw [the boy] by the extent to which he appeared to be a girl, both in appearance and in mannerism,\\u201d said the judge. \\u201cHowever, what is striking is how well [the boy] has settled down.\\u201cI have noted from reports that [the boy] has become interested in Power Rangers, SpongeBob, superheroes and is constantly finding new interests \\u2026 It is striking that most of [the boy\\u2019s] interests are male-oriented.He concluded: \\u201cI am entirely satisfied, both on the basis of the reports and [the father\\u2019s] evidence at this hearing, that he has brought no pressure on [the boy] to pursue masculine interests. [The boy\\u2019s] interests and energy are entirely self-motivated.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2}"
