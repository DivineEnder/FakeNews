One thing I learned in my years in this world is communication is key and right now you have two sides, the police officers who aren\\u2019t necessarily communicating with the citizens; the citizens are afraid of the people that are protecting and serving them so there\\u2019s no communication on either side right now and, until that happens, unfortunately, I don\\u2019t know anything like this will get solved until the communication on both sides gets better.\\u201dFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 296759, \"title\": \"ESPN's Booger McFarland: We Need Communication Between Police and Citizens\"}"
