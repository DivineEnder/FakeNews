"{\"title\": \"Abolish Human Rights Act And Britain Is Like Putin's Russia Says EU\", \"content\": \"The Conservative Party fought the last general election on a manifesto which contained a pledge to abolish the Labour government\\u2019s Human Rights Act. Although backbench colleagues feared the policy had been quietly dropped after it was left out of The Queen\\u2019s Speech in May, at the June\\u00a0events commemorating\\u00a0the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta\\u00a0the Prime Minister reaffirmed the policy. On that occasion he declared it the duty of politicians to restore the \\u2018distorted\\u2019 reputation of human rights.Now, the Daily Mail reports,\\u00a0European Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans has \\u201cstrongly rebuked\\u201d the proposed reform, warning of \\u201calarming tendencies emerging\\u201d on the rule of law across Europe.\\u00a0He\\u00a0said it would be impossible to criticise Russia for human rights violations if the government\\u00a0honoured the manifesto pledge, saying:\\u201cYou can only challenge others if you are ready to be challenged yourself.\\u00a0I take issue with people in the UK who say \\u2018we don\\u2019t need a Court in Strasbourg to check what we\\u2019re doing\\u2019.\\u201cIf you take that position in London, the same position will be taken in Moscow or elsewhere. It only works if you\\u2019re prepared to be criticised.\\u201d\\nConservative defenders of the move have been vocal in their criticism of Timmermans\\u2019 somewhat hysterical warning.\\u00a0Justice Minister Dominic Raab\\u00a0said: \\u201cThis is an irresponsible and inaccurate caricature of our plans for reform.\\u00a0The idea that the UK\\u2019s flawed Human Rights Act has helped moderate Vladimir Putin\\u2019s behaviour is ridiculous.\\u201dIn fact the manifesto pledge was at pains to preempt Timmermans\\u2019 criticism. It read:We will scrap Labour\\u2019s Human Rights Act and introduce a British Bill of Rights which will restore common sense to the application of human rights in the UK.The Bill will remain faithful to the basic principles of human rights, which we signed up to in the original European Convention on Human Rights.It will protect basic rights, like the right to a fair trial, and the right to life, which are an essential part of a modern democratic society.But it will reverse the mission creep that has meant human rights law being used for more and more purposes, and often with little regard for the rights of wider society.Among other things the Bill will stop terrorists and other serious foreign criminals who pose a threat to our society from using spurious human rights arguments to prevent deportation.The government plans to demote\\u00a0the European Court of Human Rights to a mere advisory role, with the final say in any legal dispute resting with Britain\\u2019s Supreme Court. However, defending the Human Rights Act\\u00a0is one of the few issues uniting\\u00a0Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties.With a Parliamentary majority of just 12 MPs, the government may well have to work with the Human Rights Act for some time.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 134758}"
