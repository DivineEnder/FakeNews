Douglas Rombough, the program executive officer for rotary wing at U.S. Special Operations Command,   told National Defense magazine. \\u201cWe have to have a minimum of 200 knots capability. After you add all the things you like to add to the outside of that aircraft to make it shoot, move, communicate, with all the drag out there, we need to be proceeding to the objective at 200 knots or better.\\u201d\\n\\nHelicopters typically remain in service for 20 years.

As the magazine notes, \\u201cThe new joint multi-role aircraft will have to provide drastic improvements over that current capability. That includes increasing hover altitude by 150 percent, increasing payload by 40 percent, and doubling mission speed and endurance. Special operators also want to reduce acoustic detection by 50 percent and cut in half the aircraft\\u2019s turning radius.\\u201d  Nice. \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 218508}"
