"{\"title\": \"Former Abortionist: \\u2018Majority of Americans Don\\u2019t Know What Happens To a Child During Abortion\\u2019\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"I believe if most \\u201cpro-choice\\u201d people saw that the tiny person inside wasn\\u2019t a \\u201cblob of tissue,\\u201d but a baby with a beating heart at just 3 1/2 weeks from conception, they would think very differently about abortion.If they knew that abortionists used vacuums 20 times more powerful than a household vacuum cleaner to rip the limbs off bodies so they could extract them from the mother, or used scissors and forceps to cut and pull apart the torsos of living children and crush their skulls, or injected preborn babies with toxic chemicals that caused their little hearts to stop beating, I am convinced they would think very differently about abortion. Me? Even though I saw it all, I was in deep denial. My journey to becoming pro-life was a long one. \\u00a0So many people say they are pro-life or pro-choice, yet abortion doesn\\u2019t usually affect their lives directly. But when you\\u2019re an OB/GYN and you say you\\u2019re pro-choice, it becomes very real for you, because you have to decide whether you\\u2019re going to end nascent lives at the same time you\\u2019re helping other mothers bring new lives into the world. \\u00a0I used to tell myself a million excuses to justify what I did: \\u201cWe need the money.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not pro-abortion, I\\u2019m pro-woman.\\u201d \\u201cAbortion is only a small part of what I do as a doctor.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t until my young daughter was hit by a car and taken from me that it all changed. When I experienced the pain of burying my own child, I was forced to face the ugly truth about the darker side of my job. When I returned to my practice after Heather\\u2019s death, I tried to go about my business as usual. But before long, it was my turn to perform a second trimester abortion. As I started the procedure, I inserted a clamp and ripped out the baby\\u2019s arm.Then I paused for what seemed like forever. \\u00a0I just stared at the arm in the clamp. A procedure I had done over a hundred times before suddenly made me ill. At that moment, all the lies I\\u2019d told myself to feel better about this part of my practice disappeared. The only thing that mattered was the innocent child whose life I had just ended. That day marked the beginning of my journey from abortionist to pro-life advocate.I recently partnered with Live Action, an organization that has used the power of video for nearly a decade to change people\\u2019s hearts and minds about abortion. Together, we developed a series of groundbreaking videos that show people the truth about what an abortion does to a child in the womb \\u2013 and to her mother. Last week, we began publicly releasing these short videos online in a long-term campaign that is intended to reach millions of people and change their hearts and minds about a barbaric procedure that has strangely become accepted, commonplace, and even revered \\u2014 by a society that considers itself \\u201cprogressive.\\u201d In less than five days, they received over 10 million views.As a doctor, I wanted these videos to educate. Therefore, they aren\\u2019t sensationalized. They don\\u2019t use graphic photos of abortions. They\\u2019re just the cold, hard facts based on undisputed medical science. \\u00a0We use medical animations to show what happens inside the womb during each of the four most prevalent abortion procedures. I also describe the very real risks abortion poses to the mother \\u2014 something many abortionists either won\\u2019t reveal to their clients or leave hidden in the fine print of a consent form.I\\u2019ve been on both sides of this debate, and I know the tactics of the abortionists all too well. For too long, the abortion industry has relied on people not wanting to talk about abortion in polite company, which has allowed it to hide behind a veil of deceit and euphemisms like \\u201ctissue mass,\\u201d \\u201cclump of cells,\\u201d and \\u201cproduct of conception.\\u201d I say \\u201ceuphemisms\\u201d because I know that what\\u2019s actually being aborted is a baby with a beating heart, a developing brain, a face, and often, arms, legs, fingers, and toes \\u2014and a mother and father.My hope is that others are able to see what it took me far too long to recognize: the ugly truth of what abortion does to a preborn child and the realization that, no matter what you\\u2019ve believed about abortion before \\u2014 or what you\\u2019ve done \\u2014 it\\u2019s not too late to make a decision to protect the preborn.Dr. Anthony Levatino is an OB/GYN and former abortionist. He has been asked to testify before Congress numerous times as an expert on the issue of abortion. His videos can be seen at AbortionProcedures.com.\", \"article_id\": 121026}"
