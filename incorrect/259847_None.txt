Moreover, Melowese had voted on behalf of her sister who is in a coma, her brother, and her grandchild.After she was initially charged, Richardson expressed disbelief that she could be punished for her actions: \\u201cHave they never heard of a simple mistake? Have they never heard of overlooking? Mailing in a ballot [and] registering to vote at a precinct after you\\u2019ve forgotten that you mailed in a ballot?\\u201dThis was far from Ms. Richardson\\u2019s first experience with the judicial branch of the government. In July during her voter fraud sentencing, Judge Robert Ruehlman cited her criminal record for intimidation, assault, drunken driving, and theft. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve stolen, just like you steal from stores, just like you disrupt the justice system, just like you beat people up,\\u201d the judge said.Melowese was released Tuesday after her attorney David Singleton shared with Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters that she has bipolar disorder. Judge Ruehlman agreed to place Richardson on five years of probation. \\u201cJustice was done in this case today,\\u201d Singleton said.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 259847}"
