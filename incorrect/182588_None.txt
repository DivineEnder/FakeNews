Bannon in what was her first live interview on her Sweet Freedom book tour.Palin praised Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)\\u2014who is the top champion of American workers in Congress\\u2014saying that he is \\u201cso good on immigration.\\u201d She added that it is probably \\u201chis number one issue that he thinks is most impacting on the future of America.\\u201d\\u201cHe\\u2019s going to pick one candidate who\\u2019s strongest on that issue and that is probably the person he\\u2019ll give the most attention to,\\u201d Palin said. \\u201cAnd immigration is huge on my list.\\u201dBut Palin added that so is the \\u201cunderstanding of what the federal government\\u2019s role is to be in our lives and\\u2026 protecting our Constitution in order to rein in our government.\\u201dShe also said that \\u201ccharacter counts\\u201d and any person she endorses has to \\u201chave good character in order to understand and receive what it is our Constitution intended for us.\\u201d\\u201cThey can\\u2019t be so selfish as to interpret the Constitution as some living, breathing document that they\\u2014because they are so smart and elite and have some kind of degree with their name hanging up on the wall\\u2014[are] going to change\\u2026 in order to meet their own selfish priorities,\\u201d Palin said. \\u201cNo, our Founding Fathers knew what they were talking about\\u2026 they documented those elements of freedom\\u2026 that keep us free there in the Constitution, so I\\u2019m going to find somebody with good character who knows how to protect the Constitution and get us on the right track.\\u201dIn one of the most significant and earth-shattering op-eds\\u00a0of the 2014 midterm election cycle that rocked the established order in politics and the mainstream media, Palin, writing in Breitbart News on \\u201cbehalf of American workers and legal immigrants of all backgrounds,\\u201d called for President Barack Obama to be impeached for his amnesty agenda that undermined the rule of law. \\u00a0Nearly two years before a Reuters poll found that a majority of Americans feel like strangers in their own land, Palin wrote then that many Americans \\u201cnow feel like strangers in their own land\\u201d and \\u201cit\\u2019s the American worker who is forced to deal with Obama\\u2019s latest crisis with our hard-earned tax dollars while middle class wages decrease, sustainable jobs get more scarce, and communities become unrecognizable and bankrupted due to Obama\\u2019s flood of illegal immigration.\\u201dThere is no denying the significance of a potential Palin endorsement, especially in an election cycle in which the conventional rule books have been shredded.As Breitbart News has reported and documented, Palin\\u2019s influence was proven during the 2012 cycle\\u00a0\\u2013 as candidates Palin praised before Iowa and South Carolina voted won:She praised Rick Santorum in December in 2011 when Iowans seemed lukewarm about the field of Republican primary candidates. After Palin made her remarks on December 2 on Fox News\\u2019s Hannity, Santorum, who was at four percent in the polls in Iowa\\u00a0\\u2013\\u00a0barely above Jon Huntsman, who was not even competing in the state\\u00a0\\u2013\\u00a0started getting momentum and eventually won the caucus a month later. Though Santorum had gone \\u201call-in\\u201d in Iowa and planted his campaign exclusively in the state, voters were persuaded to consider his candidacy more seriously after Palin spoke kindly of him.Palin also has a significant amount of influence in South Carolina. As\\u00a0Breitbart News has noted, \\u201cher support of Nikki Haley in the 2010 primary ensured she won the Palmetto State\\u2019s gubernatorial election\\u00a0\\u2013\\u00a0and her positive comments about Newt Gingrich enabled him to win South Carolina\\u2019s presidential primary in 2012.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2}"
