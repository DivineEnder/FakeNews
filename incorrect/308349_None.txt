"{\"title\": \"Exclusive: O'Keefe Video Sting Exposes 'Bird-Dogging' -- Democrats' Effort to Incite Violence at Trump Rallies\", \"content\": \"The goal of \\u201cbird-dogging\\u201d: to create a sense of \\u201canarchy\\u201d around Donald Trump that would undermine his political support. Often, the tactic uses the most vulnerable people \\u2014 including the elderly and disabled \\u2014 to maximize shock value.O\\u2019Keefe\\u2019s extensive video investigation reveals that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) are involved in \\u201cbird-dogging\\u201d and other provocative tactics through a web of consultants led by Robert Creamer, a veteran Chicago activist and convicted felon who is thought to have planned Democrats\\u2019 political strategy during the push for Obamacare in 2009 and 2010.Creamer is also the co-founder of Democracy Partners, a consulting group that, according to Project Veritas videos, apparently contracts directly with the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, and that works with an array of super PACs and consultants to organize, film and publicize their provocations.Robert Creamer (Screenshot / Project Veritas)Creamer affirms on one video that Clinton is aware of \\u201call\\u201d of his work, and that Democracy Partners has a daily telephone call with the Clinton campaign to coordinate efforts.O\\u2019Keefe and his team also obtained hidden camera videos showing one of Creamer\\u2019s consultants, Scott Foval, describing \\u201cbird-dogging,\\u201d among other tactics, and taking credit for having instigated violence at several Republican events during the 2016 election cycle.Foval \\u2014 who praises Creamer as \\u201cdiabolical\\u201d \\u2014 explains how \\u201cbird-dogging\\u201d works: how they\\u00a0plan confrontations in advance, choose particular individuals to provoke, and maximize media coverage.FOVAL: So one of the things we do is we stage very authentic grassroots protests right in their faces at their own events. Like, we infiltrate. And then we get it on tape. And then, when our guys get beat up\\u00a0\\u2014Project Veritas: You mean authentic-seeming grassroots?FOVAL: No, authentic.PV: You mean \\u2014FOVAL: Protesters.PV: So like \\u2014 progressive, what we saw in Madison.FOVAL: We train up our people, wherever they are, to \\u2014 and I work with a network of groups, we train them up on how to get themselves into a situation on tape, on camera, that we can use later.PV: So some of this, so I probably know your work.FOVAL: I know you do. Everybody does. But \\u2014PV: You mean like a situation where it\\u2019s sort of like a \\u2014FOVAL: You remember the Iowa State Fair thing where Scott Walker grabbed the sign out of the dude\\u2019s hand and then the dude gets kind of roughed up right in front of the stage right there on camera?PV: Yeah.FOVAL: That was all us. The guy that got roughed up is my counterpart, who works for Bob [Creamer].PV: And that was like, storyboarded? Him getting roughed up like that?FOVAL: We scenarioed it.PV: And so you, like leant yourselves to that situation and it happened. A self-fulfilling prophecy.FOVAL: We not only leant ourselves, we planted multiple people in that front area around him and in the back to make sure there wasn\\u2019t just a action that happened up front, there was also a reaction that happened out back. So the cameras, when they saw it, saw double angles of stuff like, they saw what happened up front, and they saw the reaction of people out back.PV: That\\u2019s fucking brilliant. That\\u2019s brilliant.FOVAL: And then the reporters had people to talk to.Foval also tells Project Veritas\\u2019s undercover journalist that Republicans are less adept at such tactics because they obey rules: \\u201cThey have fewer guys willing to step out on the line for what they believe in. \\u2026 There is a level of adherence to rules on the other side that only when you\\u2019re at the very highest level, do you get over.\\u201dIn another video, Foval admits that his organization is responsible for an incident in Asheville, North Carolina in September, where an elderly woman was allegedly assaulted outside a Trump rally.In that incident, the 69-year-old woman, wearing an oxygen tank, heckled a visually impaired 73-year-old Trump supporter, then pursued him. She claimed he then punched her in the jaw, though she had no visible injury; his attorney claims she touched him on the shoulder first, and then fell to the ground as he turned around. The national media covered her claims widely, while largely ignoring his. Foval explains that the woman had been \\u201ctrained\\u201d as a part of his operation.Foval also explains how the operation is set up to allow the DNC and the Clinton campaign \\u201cplausible deniability\\u201d in the event that the true nature of the deliberate violence is discovered: \\u201cThe thing that\\u00a0we have to watch is making sure there\\u2019s a double-blind between the actual campaign and the actual DNC and what we\\u2019re doing. There\\u2019s a double-blind there, so that they can plausibly deny that they heard anything about it.\\u201dHe explains the flow of money in \\u201crapid response\\u201d operations: \\u201cThe campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, the Foval Group goes and executes the shit on the ground.\\u201dAnd Foval\\u00a0emphasizes that the goal of \\u201cbird-dogging\\u201d is to create a sense of \\u201canarchy\\u201d around Trump: \\u201dThe bird-dogging. The aggressive bird-dogging. What I call it is \\u2018conflict engagement.\\u2019 \\u2026 Conflict engagement in the lines at Trump rallies? We\\u2019re starting anarchy. And he needs to understand that we\\u2019re starting anarchy.\\u201dScott Foval (Project Veritas / Screenshot)In another video, Foval notes that the Clinton campaign and the DNC are involved, through a chain of contracts: \\u201cWe are contracted directly with the DNC and the campaign. I am contracted to [Robert Creamer] but I answer to the head of special events for the DNC and the head of special events and political for the campaign. Through Bob. We have certain people who do not get to talk to them, at all.\\u201dHe explains that Democracy Partners then provides material from the field to the campaign, the DNC, and a wide array of left-wing super PACs and organizations involved in the 2016 election effort:We have a clip deliverable that we have to deliver every day for our groups of clients who are involved in this project: AUFC; A4C, which is Alliance for Change; Alliance for Retired Americans, which is part of AFL-CIO \\u2014 they\\u2019re one of our partners on the AUFC stuff \\u2026 Depends on the issue. And then there\\u2019s the DNC, and the campaigns, and Priorities [USA]. Priorities is a big part of this, too. The campaigns and DNC cannot coordinate with Priorities, but I guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the Super PACs all talk to each other, and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication.He also explains how the campaign and the super PACs use consultants as intermediaries for communication, since federal law prevents them from coordinating directly. He calls the system the \\u201cPony Express,\\u201d linking the DNC through Robert Creamer, through Robert Creamer to Foval, and through Foval to Brad Woodhouse\\u2019s super-PAC, Americans United for Change:FOVAL: We\\u2019re consultants, so we\\u2019re not the official entity. And so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts. That\\u2019s why there\\u2019s Bob, who\\u2019s the primary there, and I\\u2019m a sub to him. And I\\u2019m also a primary to AUFC separately, that\\u2019s why.PV: So there\\u2019s like a Morse code between the DNC and that Super PACs.And you guys \\u2014FOVAL: It\\u2019s less of a Morse code than it is a text conversation that never ends. It\\u2019s like that. It\\u2019s kind of like an ongoing \\u201cPony Express.\\u201d It\\u2019s not as official as it could be, but that\\u2019s because the law doesn\\u2019t allow it to be.The videos obtained by O\\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas corroborate earlier evidence of a Democratic plan to use violent imagery against the Trump campaign. A DNC PowerPoint presentation from April released by Wikileaks includes a plan to cite \\u201cincidents of violence\\u201d to create the \\u201cdesired perception\\u201d that \\u201cTrump is dangerous and divisive, undermining our values and putting our security at risk.\\u201dThe \\u201cbird-dogging\\u201d carried out by Creamer and others would appear to be part of that effort.In one hidden camera video, filmed at Creamer\\u2019s Washington, D.C. office, Creamer explains that Hillary Clinton is aware of \\u201call\\u201d of his activities, directly or indirectly, and that Democracy Partners has a daily conference call with the Clinton campaign, as well as frequent calls with the White House.Wikileaks reveals that at least one \\u201cbird-dogging\\u201d operation was approved directly by Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton\\u2019s campaign manager. In an email dated July 4, 2015, Mook approved a plan \\u201cto bird dog\\u201d Donald Trump, meaning specifically to infiltrate volunteers into his campaign events and ask him questions about immigration.Mook e-mail (Wikileaks)\\u00a0Trump supporters have frequently been the victims of real, as opposed to staged, violence.In June, for instance, Trump supporters leaving a rally in San Jose were attacked, beaten and chased by left-wing mobs. One woman was pelted with eggs in full view of the national media. The mayor of San Jose blamed Trump for the violence.Last week, Hillary Clinton supporters attacked a man carrying a sign that read \\u201cBill Clinton is a Rapist\\u201d at rally in Las Vegas hosted by the Carpenters Union.Creamer, who is married to Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), is a Saul Alinsky acolyte who trained many of the key political figures in the Chicago clique that surrounds Barack Obama. He went to prison in 2006-7 for a check-kiting scheme, but was hired by Obama to train volunteers for his 2008 presidential campaign.In 2011, Creamer opened Democracy Partners together with other veteran left-wing organizers, including Heather Booth. Creamer\\u2019s occasional columns at the Huffington Post also provide talking points to left-wing activists throughout the country, and are circulated among key Democratic staff.(Full disclosure: the author ran against Schakowsky for Congress in 2010).Joel B.
