"{\"title\": \"Secretary Kerry Will Sign UN Arms Trade Treaty\", \"content\": \"As Breitbart News reported in March, the ATT hands the executive branch the power to work with other governments around the world to shut down portions of the U.S. import firearms market. Such shut downs will be possible by seizing on ambiguous terms and phrases within the ATT\\u2013like claiming certain classes of guns are \\u201cinappropriate\\u201d or claiming others endanger \\u201cwomen and children.\\u201d\\u00a0Moreover, because the treaty includes a focus on the movement of \\u201csmall arms [and] light weapons\\u201d across borders, it will require some degree of gun registration if it is to be effective. Without the ability to ascertain the origins of these weapons how will enforcing agents know who is moving them across borders?The Associated Press reports that \\u201cmore than 85 countries have signed the treaty, but it will not take effect until 50 nations have ratified it.\\u201dOn March 23, Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) introduced an amendment to keep the U.S. from entering into the treaty. Inhofe\\u2019s amendment passed by a vote of 53 to 46. (For a list of the 46 Senators who voted \\u201cYes\\u201d click HERE.)However, once the U.S. has officially signed the treaty it can be called up for future Senate votes to accept or reject a resolution of ratification.Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins\"}"
