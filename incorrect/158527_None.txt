"{\"title\": \"Conspiracy Theorists Begin to Blame Western Science for Zika Pandemic\", \"content\": \"The\\u00a0New York Times reports that multiple conspiracy theories blaming Western scientific advances for Zika \\u2013 and the thousands of cases of microcephaly in Brazilian infants \\u2013 have begun to grow in popularity. The lesser of these theories arose in Argentina, where a group of doctors alleged that Zika is no threat and that Brazil\\u2019s microcephaly cases are the product of widespread use of the larvicide\\u00a0pyriproxyfen. The theory is a tempting explanation, as the Zika virus does not cause any symptoms in 80 percent of its patients and, in the few cases where it does, causes only mild symptoms. Zika has become a threat almost exclusively to pregnant mothers, as it appears to cause the microcephaly defect in the unborn.Doctors have warned, however, that it may also trigger Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome in adults, a neurological condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves and causes severe pain, paralysis, and death. The link between Zika and Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 remains unclear.Both Brazilian authorities and the World Health Organization immediately rejected the claim that\\u00a0pyriproxyfen, and not Zika, is responsible for Brazil\\u2019s more than 4,000 microcephaly cases.\\u00a0\\u201cUnlike the relationship between the Zika virus and microcephaly, which has had its confirmation attested in tests that indicated the presence of the virus in samples of blood, tissue and amniotic fluid, the association between the use of pyriproxyfen and microcephaly has no scientific basis,\\u201d the Brazilian Health Ministry confirmed in a statement.With Zika back to being the suspected culprit, conspiracy theorists have begun to blame Western science for allegedly\\u00a0increasing Brazil\\u2019s mosquito population, making it easier for Zika to spread. The\\u00a0New York Times notes that the most popular conspiracy theory surrounding Zika is that the British corporation Oxitec spread Zika through genetically modified\\u00a0Aedes aegypti mosquitos, the species that carries the virus.These mosquitos also carry dengue, Chikungunya virus, and yellow fever, making them the subject of a 2012 Oxitec experiment in which\\u00a0Aedes aegypti males were rendered sterile and their lifespans decreased significantly. Flooding the local mosquito population with these males forced viable mates out of the competition for females; the females would then have larvae with extremely short lifespans. Some, the newspaper notes, \\u201csee it as a plot by global elites to depopulate the earth and install a \\u2018one-world government.'\\u201d The\\u00a0Times\\u00a0notes that \\u201cAmerican actor Mark Ruffalo was among those sounding the alarm, with a post on Monday that was shared nearly 500 times.\\u201dMuch of the conversation blaming Oxitec comes from Russia. Propaganda outlet Russia Today published a story this month claiming that some experts are \\u201craising questions\\u201d about the Oxitec experiment, likening\\u00a0the experiment to \\u201cthe plot of a Hollywood blockbuster.\\u201d \\u201cAt the time, concerns were raised about the release of GMMs without further studies into possible side effects,\\u201d\\u00a0RT says of the project, citing a British drama as evidence that \\u201csuggests it could be a deliberate plan to reduce the global population.\\u201dThe theory that the West is behind the Zika epidemic has not only hit Russian propaganda publications. Russian officials have begun suggesting that the United States created the Zika virus to use as a population control method.\\u00a0\\u201cWhy am I still worried about the Abkhazian coast, which houses the mosquito?\\u2026 somewhere the 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the place where this mosquito lives today is a military microbiology laboratory of the United States Army,\\u201d\\u00a0Gennady Onishchenko, Russia\\u2019s former chief sanitary doctor, said in an interview this week. \\u201cThe presence of American laboratories and the presence of the mosquito, I am concerned about in terms of deliberate interference in the natural course of epidemic process.\\u201d The scientific facility Onishchenko refers to is run by the Georgian government, though it was built by the U.S. Army, and there is no evidence of Zika-related projects underway there.Such theories have spread to Portuguese-language media\\u00a0and, of course, English-language outlets like\\u00a0Infowars,\\u00a0which ran a headline calling Zika a \\u201cbioweapon\\u201d and implicating\\u00a0Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in the epidemic.Contrary to online theories, the Oxitec experiment appears to have succeeded in the region of Brazil where it took place. \\u201cData collected by the city and Oxitec suggest the program has decreased the number of wild mosquitoes by more than 80\\u00a0percent in the treated neighborhoods,\\u201d the\\u00a0MIT Technology Review\\u00a0reports. The reduction in mosquito population in two neighborhoods reduced the number of cases of dengue \\u201cfrom\\u00a0133 in a year to only one.\\u201dThe World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the Oxitec experiment and others like it this week.The conspiracy theories surrounding Zika recall those spreading in 2014 about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. There, the\\u00a0Liberian Observer, one of the nation\\u2019s largest newspapers, ran a column claiming that the United States government had manufactured Ebola and the HIV as \\u201cproducts of the cold war,\\u201d citing \\u201creports\\u201d and a science fiction novel. This time around, Chris Brown became the celebrity to claim Ebola was a \\u201cform of population control,\\u201d the result of such hysteria being widespread attacks on Western medical volunteers working to save Ebola patients.\\u00a0Brazil has so far recorded over 4,000 cases of microcephaly, with the few infants undergoing testing confirmed to have been carrying Ebola before their deaths. Brazil remains the only country in the region with significant numbers of suspected Ebola cases to also see a surge in microcephaly cases.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 158527}"
