"{\"title\": \"Trump: Snowden 'really hurt us'\", \"content\": \"Donald Trump says the United States\\u2019 inability to get NSA leaker Edward Snowden back in the country to face charges is \\u201cpathetic.\\u201dTrump told \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d Monday morning that the information Snowden released has weakened U.S. relations with China, and his travels around the world have damaged the country\\u2019s relationships further.\\u201cHe\\u2019s a terrible guy who\\u2019s really set our country back. China\\u2019s now looking at us like \\u2026 we were hitting them hard on what they were doing, in terms of what they were taking from us, and now they are really going at it, they\\u2019re saying we\\u2019re far worse than they ever were,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cAnd he\\u2019s really hurt us in terms of relationship. And it really shows how weak our country\\u2019s been and has become when you cannot get this guy back.\\u201d( PHOTOS: Pols, pundits react to Snowden on the run)Trump also suggested that Snowden\\u2019s time abroad could have opened U.S. information to the countries hosting him, and retribution must be \\u201cswift and really strong\\u201d to prevent other leakers.\\u201cFor him to be ensconced in China, and then all of a sudden he gets out because they say, \\u2018Oh I\\u2019m sorry you sent in the wrong document, and we would have done it but you sent in the wrong document.\\u2019 And they got a lot of information out of this guy. This guy is a bad guy. And, you know, there is still a thing called execution,\\u201d Trump said.Amid reports Monday morning that Snowden was supposed to take off on a plane for Cuba, but he never showed, Trump said the U.S. needed to get him back.\\u201cNow nobody knows where he is, but we have to get him back and we have to get him back fast. They\\u2019re talking about it could take years, it could take months but maybe years: That would be pathetic,\\u201d Trump said.And Trump had a theory about why Snowden didn\\u2019t leave Russia as expected Monday.\\u201cHe\\u2019s revealing things that nobody thought possible, and I think he\\u2019s probably got stuff that\\u2019s far \\u2013 that\\u2019s maybe why he\\u2019s staying in Russia. Russia\\u2019s very smart, and they\\u2019re probably getting every possible thing out of him,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cThey say, \\u2018Hey wait a minute, let\\u2019s not send him to Ecuador or wherever he\\u2019s going. Let\\u2019s immediately \\u2014 let\\u2019s talk to him for a couple more days. This is good stuff.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 40528}"
