"{\"content\": \"{\\\"JERUSALEM \\u2014 In the absence of any prospect of peace with thePalestinians, Prime MinisterBenjamin NetanyahuofIsraelhas started a video war.\\\",\\\"His latest, and so far the most provocative, two-minute video in a recent series is titled\\u201cNo Jews.\\u201dIn the video, Mr. Netanyahu accuses thePalestinian leadershipof demanding a Jew-free Palestinian state by opposingIsraeli settlementsin theWest Bank. He adds, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a phrase for that: It\\u2019s called ethnic cleansing.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A storm of international and domesticcriticismfollowed the release of the video on Friday, with some calling Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s arguments divisive and delusional. TheState Department describedthe language in the video as \\u201cinappropriate and unhelpful\\u201d and said it had taken the issue directly to the Israeli government.\\\",\\\"But many have cheered for him, saying Mr. Netanyahu is exposing the hypocrisy of Israel\\u2019s detractors, whose concern for human rights, they feel, seems to apply only to the Palestinians.\\\",\\\"Days after the release of the video, Israelis and Palestinians were still debating the effects of Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s \\u201chasbara\\u201d offensive, using a Hebrew term for pro-Israeli advocacy. Was Mr. Netanyahu destroying Israel\\u2019s international relations, ties already strained over the continued settlement construction in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that much of the world considers illegitimate? Or was he a public relations genius, using the world stage to score points with his home audience?\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere is something ridiculous about Netanyahu\\u2019s claim against \\u2018ethnic cleansing of Jews,\\u2019\\u201dBen-Dror Yemini, a political columnist often critical of Israel\\u2019s opponents,wrotein Monday\\u2019s edition of the newspaperYediot Aharonot.\\\",\\\"Mr. Yemini wrote that population transfers were historically intended to ensure the right of self-determination and to establish nation states. He maintained that Mr. Netanyahu has turned that concept on its head. Israelis settling in the heart of Arab-populated areas of the West Bank were, he wrote, \\u201cthe antithesis of the idea of self-determination and a Jewish and democratic nation state, because instead of separation there is a mix-up of hostile populations.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Xavier Abu Eid, an adviser to thePalestine Liberation Organizationin the West Bank, said, \\u201cWe are not against people of any religion living in the state of Palestine.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He described Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s use of the \\u201creligion card\\u201d as dangerous, adding, \\u201cThere is a difference between settlers living in exclusive communities on stolen land and someone who is living in the country as a citizen like anybody else.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Abu Eid said that some American and Israeli Jews were already living in areas of the West Bank under Palestinian control. He said that his neighbors in Ramallah included Christians, Muslims, a Druse family from the Golan Heights and a Jewish woman.\\\",\\\"The Palestinian president,Mahmoud Abbas, in hisgreetinglate Sunday for Eid al-Adha, the Muslim holiday, accused Israel of its own ethnic cleansing. He has made that claim before,including at the United Nations.\\\",\\\"Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s latest video, recorded in English with versions that have Hebrew or Arabic subtitles, already has more than a million views betweenhis Facebook pageand theFacebook page of the Israeli prime minister\\u2019s office, and even more through other social networks and news media coverage.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe prime minister is twinning his powerful message with powerful technology to spread the truth farther and faster,\\u201d said David Keyes, Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s recently appointed foreign media adviser.\\\",\\\"Answering questions by WhatsApp, Mr. Keyes, who is credited for orchestrating the video campaign, said the eight videos produced so far had over 42 million views. He added that Mr. Netanyahu has been making the same points raised in the video for decades, including in his book,\\u201cA Durable Peace.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Many Israelis were baffled by the timing of the video, given that Israel and the United States are close to signinga significant new aid package.In response to this concern, Mr. Keyes said, \\u201cIs there a bad time to criticize ethnic cleansing?\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Keyes did not answer a question about the status the prime minister envisioned for Jews living in a future Palestinian state: as Palestinian citizens or Israeli citizens under military protection.\\\",\\\"Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said in an interview that Mr. Netanyahu had been using similar terminology to that in the video for over a year in official meetings with foreign diplomats. Ms. Hotovely described the West Bank as \\u201cthe tribal land of the Jewish people, the bible land.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cOur connection is much deeper than those who came later,\\u201d she said.\\\",\\\"In an August video, as Israelchargedthat Hamas had pilfered the funds of an international charity in Gaza, Mr. Netanyahuarguedthat he cared more about the Palestinians than their leaders did. The Palestine Liberation Organization\\u2019s department of culture and information countered with theirversionof that video, complete with canned laughter and images of Israeli forces brutalizing Palestinians, demolishing homes and bombing Gaza.\\\",\\\"Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s newest video took a dig at the world players that oppose Israel\\u2019s settlement activity, saying, \\u201cSome otherwise enlightened countries even promote this outrage.\\u201d A campaign adviser toDonald J.Trump, David Friedman,told the Haaretz newspaperthat the Obama administration \\u201cshould be ashamed of their misguided reaction\\u201d to the video.\\\",\\\"As Haaretznoted, the messages in the \\u201cethnic cleansing\\u201d video are identical to those proposed indocument written in 2009by Frank Luntz, an American political consultant who is identified with the Republican Party. Written for the Israel Project, a pro-Israel advocacy group, Mr. Luntz espoused those ideas as \\u201cthe best settlement argument.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Keyes said that Mr. Luntz had not been consulted for the Netanyahu videos. Mr. Luntz did not respond to questions sent by email about his work in Israel.\\\",\\\"Israeli analysts have described the videos as an attempt by Mr. Netanyahu to distract Israelis from his slipping popularity and thepolice inquiriesplaguing him and his family.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSometimes the English is meant for the Hebrew audience,\\u201d said Yoaz Hendel, a former director of communications in Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s office, noting that Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s speeches in Congress and the United Nations have often played well back home.\\\",\\\"Some have also questioned whether Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s predecessors should be considered guilty of ethnic cleansing. These include Israeli leaders such as Ariel Sharon, who destroyed all the settlements in Gaza in 2005, or Menachem Begin, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who evacuated the Sinai settlements as part of the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt.\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 348875, \"title\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu Draws Fire After Saying Palestinians Support \\u2018Ethnic Cleansing\\u2019\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
