"{\"title\": \"Putin exploits Europe\\u2019s divisions in bid to dominate gas supply \", \"content\": \"KARLSHAMN, Sweden\\u2014This small port town offers a textbook case of how Russian President Vladimir Putin has thwarted U.S. and European efforts to rein in Moscow\\u2019s most powerful source of leverage and cash: energy.Karlshamn\\u2019s local leaders in January opened its port to Russia\\u2019s state-owned energy company, PAO Gazprom, in defiance of Swedish national authorities alarmed by a growing Russian military presence in the Baltic Sea. A subcontractor for a Gazprom subsidiary is now allowed to store pipes here for an $11 billion undersea natural-gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, easing the path for a project opposed by Sweden\\u2019s national government, the European Union and the U.S.\\u201cWe are not afraid of the Russians,\\u201d said Per-Ola Mattsson, Karlshamn\\u2019s mayor, who supports the agreement. \\u201cBut in Stockholm, I think they are.\\u201dSweden is a prime example of Mr. Putin\\u2019s divide-and-conquer strategy as he attempts to maintain Russia\\u2019s status as an energy powerhouse and a geopolitical force in Europe. The Nordic country has reinstituted a military draft and moved troops to a strategic Baltic Sea island in response to Russian military moves, but it can\\u2019t stop Karlshamn from helping Gazprom because local governments in Sweden have strong authority over local affairs.The pipeline, called Nord Stream 2 and expected to be completed at the end of 2019, is a priority for Moscow, which depends on pipeline gas sales for more than 10% of its export revenues. It would double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream pipeline to Germany and allow Russia to bypass Ukraine to reach its most lucrative European markets.Nord Stream (existing)Nord Stream 2 (planned)VyborgfinlandNarvaBayswedenest.rus.GOTLANDlatviaKarlshamnBalticSealith.BEL.rus.Lubmin100 milesGreifswaldpoland100 kmger.VyborgNord Stream (existing)finlandNord Stream 2 (planned)Narva BaynorwayswedenestoniarussiaGOTLANDlatviaKarlshamndenmarkBalticSealithuaniaBELARUSrussiaLubminGreifswald100 miles100 kmpolandgermanyVyborgNord Stream (existing)finlandNord Stream 2 (planned)Narva BaynorwayswedenestoniarussiaGOTLANDlatviadenmarkKarlshamnBalticSealithuaniaBELARUSrussiaLubminGreifswald100 miles100 kmpolandgermanyVyborgNord Stream (existing)finlandNord Stream 2 (planned)Narva BayswedenestoniarussiaGOTLANDlatviaKarlshamnBalticSealithuaniaBELARUSrussiaLubminGreifswald100 milespolandgermany100 kmSource: Nord Stream 2U.S. and European authorities have worked against Nord Stream 2, saying it deepens Russia\\u2019s influence. The EU and the Obama administration said it would deprive Ukraine of economic leverage and a crucial source of income in the wake of Russia\\u2019s invasion there. The Trump administration\\u2019s position isn\\u2019t clear. The State Department didn\\u2019t respond to requests to comment.Moscow is moving forward by exploiting disjunction and competing priorities in the EU, which on Thursday indicated it couldn\\u2019t block the pipeline outright.German Chancellor \\n      Angela Merkel\\n       has been a driving force behind EU economic sanctions against Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, but she has also supported Nord Stream 2, calling it a commercial project. Germany, the largest importer of Gazprom\\u2019s gas, is shepherding the project through the EU despite opposition from more than a half-dozen members. Nord Stream 2 will make Germany the main hub for gas imports into Europe.European energy companies were blocked from helping to build it because of Polish antitrust claims but are actively trying to find a way to stay involved.European countries to Germany\\u2019s east such as Slovakia and Poland call Nord Stream 2 a political venture designed to increase Russia\\u2019s leverage. They worry about reduced income from Russian gas flows through their countries, as well as a recurrence of the 2009 natural-gas crisis, when Russia restricted gas flows in a dispute with Ukraine over energy payments.\\u201cIt is about politics and influence,\\u201d Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said of Nord Stream 2 at a conference in Munich in February.The Kremlin, Gazprom and Nord Stream 2 executives say the project has nothing to do with politics. The pipeline \\u201cisn\\u2019t directed against any of our partners,\\u201d Mr. Putin said at a meeting on March 22 with the leadership of German chemical group \\n        BASF SE\\n        .\\n       He said rising consumption and falling production in Europe made it an \\u201cabsolutely natural project\\u201d and that the pipeline is of \\u201ca purely commercial nature.\\u201dWhile EU members are debating, Russia is developing: About 700 kilometers of pipes, more than a quarter of the total needed for the project, have been shipped to ports in the Baltic Sea region, and 5 kilometers more are sent every day. The project\\u2019s onshore component in Russia is under construction.Building Nord Stream 2 would hand Mr. Putin an important victory in demonstrating the limits of Western efforts to restrain him economically. Despite U.S. sanctions that pushed Russia into a recession, Mr. Putin and Russian companies allied with him have secured funding for an enormous natural-gas project in the Arctic and sent oil-production levels to post-Soviet records.The EU has in recent years managed to curb the power of Gazprom to dictate gas prices. New regulations and pipelines allowed neighbors to share gas, and countries built plants to allow imports of liquefied natural gas. Gazprom has offered to change the way it does business in response to an EU antitrust case against the company. Europe is looking to the U.S., Australia and Africa for future gas imports.Still, Russia has cemented its grip on supplies to Europe anyway, largely through cheap pricing and readily available supplies. Last year, Gazprom said it exported record amounts of gas to the EU, accounting for more than one-third of imports.Even EU members who don\\u2019t rely on Russia for gas are unnerved, including Sweden. Leaders of this northern European nation of some 9.5 million say Russia\\u2019s moves to control Europe\\u2019s gas supplies coincide with Mr. Putin\\u2019s aggressive military moves in the Baltic Sea.Russia will hold large-scale military exercises near the Baltic states in September, which will take place at the same time as military drills by Western forces in Sweden. Russia is also building up military forces in the Kaliningrad exclave and has increased conventional and cyberespionage, Swedish officials say.In response, Sweden is sending a battle group of 300 troops, including a mechanized infantry and a tank company, to the Baltic Sea island of Gotland.Sweden isn\\u2019t a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but it is stepping up coordination with the military alliance.The pipeline became a divisive issue in Sweden when a subcontractor of Nord Stream 2 AG, which is wholly owned by Gazprom, had wanted to use two Swedish ports: one on Gotland and the other in Karlshamn.The defense ministry raised security concerns, and Gotland rejected the proposal.Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said in an interview that the government wanted legislative changes that would give central authorities power to decide on matters concerning national security at major infrastructure sites.\\u201cWe are against Nord Stream 2,\\u201d said Mr. Hultqvist, calling it \\u201ca problem from a European perspective.\\u201dKarlshamn, a 350-year-old port town of some 20,000 people, was gripped by debate. Allowing pipes to be stored in its harbor would bring around $10 million in revenues and 30 jobs, but it would also help Russia.\\u201cFor me, what is obviously not good for Sweden and the EU cannot in the same sentence be good for Karlshamn,\\u201d said Magnus G\\u00e4rdebring, leader of the local opposition.Mr. Mattsson, the mayor who supported the project, argued Karlshamn already services ships with Russian crews and stores Russian crude oil, so why reject the pipeline? His office received heated emails accusing him of being a Russian stooge, an aide said.\\u201cIf we have to stop business like this, do we have to stop all business that has to do with Russians?\\u201d Mr. Mattsson said. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t decide for Sweden and the European Union.\\u201dWrite to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.comAppeared in the Mar. 31, 2017, print edition as 'Russia Taps Political Splits.'\", \"source_id\": 22245, \"article_id\": 349452}"
