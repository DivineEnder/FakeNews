Al Qaeda had four major attacks against US interests. The attack on the embassies, the failed attack, the first one, on the World Trade Center, the attack on the Cole, and then 9/11, and it thrived, crescendo is 9/11. After which we decided to go after them. They were then driven out of their sanctuary, physically. We have not had a major attack on that scale from al Qaeda since.\\u201dHe added, \\u201cIn the end, can you do everything you want. you can put \\u2014 you can have the most wonderful social media experts to counter the message of ISIL.
