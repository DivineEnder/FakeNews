"{\"article_id\": 1391, \"title\": \"Of college hoops and lobbying dollars\", \"content\": \"Player statistics, conference loyalties and a preference for a particular mascot are all perfectly fine ways to fill in the slots of the March Madness brackets.The Center for Responsive Politics opted for the Washington way: money.Within days of the NCAA announcement of the 64 teams that would vie for the national basketball championship, the center put out a bracket sheet that awarded victories to the schools that spent the most on lobbying.The predicted winner of next week\\u2019s championship game, according to the center, was SUNY Binghamton, which spent $1.8 million lobbying Congress last year.Unfortunately for the center and the Bearcats, the team was sent packing by Duke University in the first round.Still, the exercise cast a spotlight on an often overlooked part of the lobbying world: higher education.It\\u2019s a big-dollar, high-stakes venue. Of the 64 colleges and universities that made it into the NCAA tournament, only nine reported spending no money on lobbying last year, the center found.Overall, higher education spent $75 million lobbying Congress last year for research grants, construction money, patent reform and a wide array of policy issues.Beyond paid lobbyists, universities and colleges have a host of other ways to get the attention of influential members of Congress.For starters, they can name buildings after them. How many corporate lobbyists wouldn\\u2019t love to have that chip to play?The University of Kansas campus is dotted with buildings named after former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who also helped win federal money for their construction.Higher education institutions also can provide a soft landing for former administration officials or lawmakers who are retired from politics, voluntarily or not.Former Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) is president of the University of Oklahoma. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala is president of the University of Miami.Universities are also teeming with would-be campaign backers, including influential local leaders whose endorsements matter, potential donors and students willing to do grass-roots work on the campaign trail.During the 2008 presidential campaign, Democrat Barack Obama received $22 million from donors working in education. Republican John McCain received $1.7 million.Universities and colleges can also be terrific backdrops for local media events, which give trustees, regents and advocates some exclusive time to pitch their own causes to the visiting politician.All that added access may help explain why higher education projects pop up so often in earmarks, the spending projects specifically targeted by House and Senate members.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
