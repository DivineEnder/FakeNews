According to court records obtained by Breitbart Texas, authorities raided\\u00a0a human stash house\\u00a0in late October.\\u00a0\\u00a033 illegal aliens were found inside. While questioning the ringleader of that group, a man named Manuel de Jesus \\u201cChuy\\u201d Rodriguez Loa, they learned that his boss, Pedro \\u201cJalisco\\u201d Flores Villanueva had another house with close to 40 people in the border city of Edinburg. The man also said that Jalisco was in charge of several other stash houses in the area.Border Patrol agents working with their local counterparts were able to track down Flores and pull him over for making a turn without signaling. During that traffic stop, agents arrested Flores and questioned him about two of his stash houses. Authorities also arrested his assistant Jose Luz Alfredo \\u201cGuero\\u201d Barco\\u00a0 and a woman who had just been smuggled. Inside the vehicle agents found\\u00a0cash and a ledger with the information of the people in the houses. The man gave permission to go into his houses where more arrests were carried out.During questioning by agents, Flores told them he had crossed the Rio Grande illegally from Reynosa using a raft in September and had begun to work for a human smuggling organization that operated in Edinburg. Flores identified his fellow smugglers as \\u201cChuy\\u201d, La Gata, El Raton, Alejandro \\u201cTiburon\\u201d Torres Sanchez, Carlos \\u201cKangrejo\\u201d Villa Garcia and Martin \\u201cLa Perra\\u201d Moreno Serrano. Most of the men have not been arrested and authorities have not yet been able to identify \\u201cLa Gata\\u201d and \\u201cEl Raton.\\u201dTiburon alone would transport about 35 illegal aliens per\\u00a0week for Flores, court records revealed. Records show that agents interviewed various women who were being held at the stash houses and while the documents do not make it clear, they point to a possible sexual abuse of the women. One of the women who is form Honduras said she was going to pay $2,000 to be illegally smuggled and crossed on October 21 along with 15 other illegal aliens.\\u00a0 Once across the woman was taken to a stash house run by Flores, however on one night \\u201cEl Guero\\u201d took her to a motel. Court records do not specify if the woman was sexually abused or coerced into sexual intercourse but she told agents that she was not mistreated.Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas you can follow him on\\u00a0Twitter\\u00a0and on\\u00a0Facebook.Human Smugglers\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 306209}"
