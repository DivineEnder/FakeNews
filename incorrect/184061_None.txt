"{\"article_id\": 184061, \"content\": \"A grieving family are fighting to prevent their grandfather being thrown out of his final resting place, after a Muslim family objected to their relative being buried next to a \\u201cnon-believer\\u201d.Mr Shadrack Smith, 89, was laid to rest last month in Leicestershire after over 400 people attended his funeral, including his eight children, 25 grandchildren and 40 great grandchildren. But since then Burbage Parish Council, which operates the grave yard, has received a complaint about his burial.Smith was described as a popular figure within in Romany community, and was buried in at the multi-faith cemetery in Lychgate Lane Cemetery. His family paid for \\u00a32500 for three plots, and he was buried facing towards his home, as is the tradition in his community. But this proved unacceptable to the so-far unnamed Muslim family, according to the Daily Mail.The\\u00a0Parish Council received the request from the Muslim family to have him exhumed shortly after, a move that his family say they will fight \\u201ctooth and nail\\u201d. Smith\\u2019s next of kin\\u00a0were warned of the threat to his grave just two weeks after his funeral.His daughter-in-law Tracey Smith 46, told the Mail: \\u201cThis whole thing has devastated our family. We were told when we bought the plots that it was a multi-faith cemetery and it is, but the council has been so unsupportive.\\u201cI feel for the Muslim family because they obviously thought they were going to only have other Muslim families buried around them, but that\\u2019s not our fault, or our mistake. We have been in the right, and yet the council has tried to bend over backwards to please the Muslim family.\\u201dShe added: \\u201cWe have been told we might have to exhume Shady if the council decide to side with the Muslim family. My mother-in-law found a plot which faced their home, which is a Romany tradition, and it was perfect.\\u201cSo we paid, but to then have the council trying to get us to move when we have done nothing wrong, it\\u2019s disgusting. We have not been able to grieve because of all this drama, and it\\u2019s been awful.\\u201dThe council said they wanted to come to an \\u201camicable solution\\u201d and had already suggested using one of the Smith family\\u2019s plots to create a \\u201csegregation\\u201d. They will rule tomorrow, but they do have the power to move his body\\u00a0without the family\\u2019s consent.\", \"title\": \"Grandfather's Body May Be Exhumed After Relatives Of Muslim Buried Next To Him Complain He Was Unbeliever\", \"source_id\": 2}"
