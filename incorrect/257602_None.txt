"{\"title\": \"Islamist Sect in Nigeria Grows More Deadly\", \"content\": \"(AP) Islamist sect in Nigeria grows more deadlyBy JON GAMBRELLAssociated PressJOHANNESBURGThe radical Islamist fighters gather around piles of weapons and ammunition they\\u2019ve stolen and shout praises to God as they shoot into the expanse of the African desert.Those depicted in this video don\\u2019t come from long-lawless Somalia, nor from al-Qaida North Africa branch. These extremists are from Boko Haram, the Islamist group in Nigeria that turned to wide-scale violence in 2009 over local grievances and largely focused their assaults in Maiduguri, the city where the sect started.Now, Boko Haram seems to be growing more violent with a record number of people killed this year and slowly internationalizing its stance, a possible danger for the rest of West Africa. More than 770 people have been killed in Boko Haram attacks so far this year, according to an Associated Press count, making 2012 the worst year of violence attributed to the group.Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan\\u2019s government has not found an effective response to Boko Haram, analysts say. Making matters worse, government soldiers in the last two months responded to Boko Haram attacks by opening fire in public places, killing dozens of civilians in two incidents. The shootings further alienated Nigeria\\u2019s Muslim population and have likely driven some toward supporting the sect, local residents say.Boko Haram, whose name means \\u201cWestern education is sacrilege\\u201d in the Hausa language of Nigeria\\u2019s Muslim north, grew out of a religious movement founded by Mohammed Yusuf. The name _ a moniker that stuck after Yusuf constantly used it as a refrain during his preaching _ means more than just rejecting Western education, science and other Western beliefs. Adherents also dismiss Western-style democracy, which Nigeria embraced in 1999 after decades of military rule. While the nation\\u2019s political and business elite have grown ever richer, poverty still crushes most of those living in the north and its young have few economic or educational opportunities. About 75 percent of the people in Nigeria\\u2019s northeast _ the home of Boko Haram _ live in absolute poverty on less than $1 a day, according to the country\\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.In 2009, rioting by Boko Haram set off a military crackdown that left 700 people dead in Maiduguri. Army tanks destroyed the sect\\u2019s Maiduguri mosque and Yusuf was killed in police custody. The group went underground, but reemerged about a year later, carrying out guerrilla-style shootings from the back of motorbikes and setting off small bombs.Over time Boko Haram has grown far more sophisticated, bombing the United Nations headquarters in Nigeria\\u2019s capital, Abuja, and launching massive, military-style assaults like one that killed at least 185 people in Kano in January. Soldiers have been deployed in the streets across northeast Nigeria but Boko Haram has repeatedly used suicide car bombers to attack churches and security posts.The sect has said it will stop its attacks only if the government strictly implements Shariah law and frees its imprisoned members. Officials in Nigeria\\u2019s presidency have given conflicting information about reaching out to the group. In August, presidential spokesman Reuben Abati told journalists that the government had opened \\u201cback channel\\u201d negotiations with Boko Haram. On Nov. 1, after a previously unknown, self-proclaimed Boko Haram leader said the group would be willing to hold talks in Saudi Arabia, Abati again told journalists that indirect talks had begun.However, Jonathan, in a November interview with journalists broadcast on state-run television and radio, denied any such talks had taken place.Abati did not respond to requests to clarify his earlier remarks.The sect\\u2019s apparent leader, Abubakar Shekau, appears to be even more hardline than Yusuf. Boko Haram has loose connections with al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Somalia\\u2019s al-Shabab, according to Western military officials and diplomats. In April, witnesses said they saw English-speaking militants they believed came from Nigeria in northern Mali, which fell into the hands of Islamists in the wake of a March coup in Mali\\u2019s capital.Army Gen. Carter Ham, the commander of the U.S. military\\u2019s Africa Command, said Monday that while Boko Haram appears focused on local issues it could become a greater worldwide threat if left unchecked. Ham said the group has already received training, money and weaponry from al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb as part of \\u201ca relationship that goes both ways.\\u201dHowever, Ham ruled out any U.S. military involvement and said a Nigerian military crackdown could only be used as \\u201cpart of a broader strategy.\\u201dMeanwhile, the killings and threats continue. In a video posted last week to an online jihadist forum, Shekau said killing police \\u201cis permissible\\u201d and called democracy \\u201ca disbelieving system,\\u201d while also applauding other Islamist insurgencies around the world.The Nigerian Islamists warned that they intend to maintain their violent campaign, ending their message with another video showing fighters standing beside Kalashnikov assault rifles and bullets. A fighter fired a heavy machine gun into the distance, while another used a rifle with a scope. A group of fighters also walked through the scrub of the desert, with one carrying a rocket-propelled grenade launcher over his shoulder.___Jon Gambrell can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 257602}"
