"{\"title\": \"Iran, Gulf monarchies seek to ease tension\", \"content\": \"Iran and the Gulf states, whose contest for power in the Middle East has been tipping toward open confrontation, are quietly trying to repair the damaged relationship as the U.S. takes a more confrontational stance toward Tehran.The longstanding rivalry flared last year when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shiite cleric and angry Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy, smashing its windows and setting the compound on fire. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain responded by severing diplomatic ties with Iran, and other Gulf states sided with Riyadh.Now, even as public rhetoric remains strident, signs of a tentative rapprochement have surfaced in recent low-profile meetings between Iranian and Gulf officials, including a visit by Iranian President \\n      Hassan Rouhani\\n       to Kuwait and Oman, and a recent agreement between Riyadh and Tehran to allow Iranians to join this year\\u2019s hajj pilgrimage to the Saudi city of Mecca. Iranians were excluded from last year\\u2019s hajj\\u2014a religious duty Muslims should fulfill once in their lifetimes\\u2014after talks with Saudi officials collapsed.The hajj deal \\u201cshows that there is hope that the relationship can become more pragmatic,\\u201d said \\n      Abdullah al-Shammary, \\n       a Riyadh-based political analyst and former Saudi diplomat. \\u201cNow is the time is to sit and talk.\\u201dBehind the steps toward better ties, say analysts and officials, is a new U.S. administration that has taken a more confrontational stance toward Tehran. President \\n      Donald Trump\\n       and his aides have vowed to reverse the Obama administration\\u2019s outreach to Iran\\u2014a shift America\\u2019s longtime Gulf allies have welcomed.\\u201cUnder Obama, Iran was under no pressure to make serious efforts to improve relations\\u201d with the Gulf, said \\n      Ibrahim Fraihat, \\n       a professor of conflict resolution at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies in Qatar. \\u201cIran has realized that has changed.\\u201dThe decline in oil prices has also created pressure to resolve differences. In November, Saudi Arabia dropped its demand that Iran slash its crude output to reach an OPEC deal aimed at limiting global production to prop up prices, now hovering around $50 a barrel\\u2014about half of where it was a few years ago.\\u201cIt seems that because of a lack of money, they have to sit around a table and talk to each other,\\u201d said \\n      Saeed Laylaz, \\n       an Iranian economist close to President Rouhani\\u2019s moderate political faction.In addition, Saudi Arabia has suffered a series of foreign policy setbacks. Riyadh is trying to extricate itself from its war in Yemen, a costly campaign that it waded into in part to check what it perceived as Iran\\u2019s influence in a neighboring country. And in Syria, Iran- and Russia-backed government forces late last year overwhelmed rebels the kingdom supported in Aleppo.\\u201cAleppo was a turning point, and the Saudis have been pragmatic about it,\\u2019\\u201d said a Western diplomat based in the Gulf. \\u201cThey said: \\u2018We lost. Let\\u2019s make the best of a bad situation.\\u2019\\u201dSaudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy, and Shiite-dominated Iran are still exchanging sharp words. \\u201cFor 35 years, we have extended our arm in friendship to the Iranians, and for 35 years we have gotten death and destruction in return,\\u201d Saudi Foreign Minister \\n      Adel al-Jubeir\\n       told a security conference in Germany last month. \\u201cThis cannot continue.\\u201dRiyadh and others in the Gulf accuse Iran of exploiting sectarian tensions to gain political influence across the Arab world and say Tehran\\u2019s recent ballistic missile test launch worries them.\\u201cIran is saying, privately and publicly, that they want to turn the page, they would like to have dialogue,\\u201d said \\n      Abdelaziz Aluwaisheg, \\n       assistant secretary-general for political affairs at the Gulf Cooperation Council, the umbrella body for the Gulf\\u2019s Arab states. \\u201cWhile they tell us that, they also continue these activities.\\u201dThe flurry of diplomatic activity began in January, with a visit by Kuwait\\u2019s foreign minister to Tehran on behalf of the GCC. As a condition for improved ties, the six-nation body has appealed to Tehran to end its interference in the region, including arming and supporting Shiite proxies, according to Western and Arab officials.Tehran says the Sunni Muslim monarchies have suppressed the rights of their Shiite populations, and fueled extremism through their support of Sunni rebel groups in Syria.A Rift in the GulfIran and Saudi Arabia, whose often troubled relationship had grown increasingly strained in recent years, are making tentative moves toward easing the tension.King Salman ascends to the Saudi throne.

Saudi Arabia leads a U.S.-backed Sunni Arab coalition there that is fighting to unseat the Houthi rebels, who practice an offshoot of Shiite Islam and are supported by Iran, with the aim of restoring to power ousted President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.In a sign that Saudi Arabia is softening its stance toward some Iranian allies, Mr. al-Jubeir last month became the first Saudi foreign minister in more than two decades to visit Iraq, a Shiite-majority country where Iran has extensive influence.In November, Riyadh supported a deal that elevated to the Lebanese presidency a Christian ally of the militant and political group Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy.Mr. Rouhani\\u2019s deputy chief of staff, in a \\n        Twitter\\n        \\n       message during the Iranian president\\u2019s visit to the Gulf last month, welcomed the diplomatic opening, but warned it may not last.\\u201cOpportunity passes like a cloud,\\u201d he wrote in Arabic, the language of the Gulf states, instead of his native Farsi. \\u201cTherefore make good use of good opportunities.\\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   An earlier version of the timeline video and slideshow in this article incorrectly stated that Iranian protesters ransacked the Saudi embassy in Riyadh on Jan. 2, 2016.
