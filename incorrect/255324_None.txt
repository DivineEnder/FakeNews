"{\"title\": \"'Hate Groups' Spread Across America...Or Maybe Not\", \"content\": \"The UK\\u00a0Daily Mail\\u00a0reports on:\\u00a0\\u201cThe pockets of hatred spread across America: California has the most hate groups, followed by Florida and New York.\\u201dThere\\u2019s a great deal to question about this analysis, beginning with the fact that way down at the bottom of the article, we are told the count of \\u201chate groups\\u201d\\u00a0declined\\u00a0by 17 percent between 2013 and 2014, bringing it to the lowest level since 2005. That would make the attention-grabbing headline assertion the opposite of what the report actually says \\u2013 the number of hate groups is declining, not increasing.That\\u2019s assuming the report should be taken at face value, which it should not, seeing as how it originates from the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has a history of irresponsibly declaring its political opponents as \\u201chate groups.\\u201d Most infamously, a previous map of \\u201chate groups\\u201d from the SPLC led a disturbed man named Floyd Lee Corkins to launch a gun assault on the Family Research Council in Washington D.C., packing a hundred rounds of ammo and a bag of Chick-fil-A sandwiches, which he intended to stuff in the mouths of his slain victims. Fortunately, he was stopped by the FRC\\u2019s heroic building manager, who disarmed Corkins after taking a bullet.For much of the Left, \\u201chate\\u201d equals\\u00a0dissent.\\u00a0Even if the effort to identify \\u201chate groups\\u201d could be purged of all political bias, it\\u2019s still a highly subjective classification, especially when the point of creating a \\u201chate map\\u201d is to convince residents of certain areas that they have a serious problem requiring vigilance, possible legal action\\u2026 and of course, generous donations to the groups that draw hate maps.The SPLC totals cited by the\\u00a0Daily Mail\\u00a0include \\u201c72 Ku Klux Klan groups, 142 neo-Nazi groups, 115 White Nationalist groups, 119 racist skinhead groups, 21 Christian identity groups, 37 neo-confederate groups, 113 black separatist groups, and 165 general hate groups.\\u201dForgive the skepticism, but there would seem to be\\u00a0an awful lot of subjective wiggle room in the category of \\u201cgeneral hate groups.\\u201d The SPLC does a lot of mouth-breathing about how organized political resistance to Barack Obama, and government power in general, constitute \\u201chatred\\u201d and \\u201cextremism\\u201d \\u2013 which are not actually synonymous, although the report labors mightily to connect the terms. The SPLC predictably can\\u2019t seem to find much \\u201cextremism\\u201d on the Left, but they rail endlessly against \\u201cpatriot\\u201d groups and conservatives. They even\\u00a0relate the false anecdote about Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) speaking to a David Duke group, which would make the Southern Poverty Law Center a hate group under its own definition. Hopefully they\\u2019ll have the intellectual integrity to update their hate map with the location of their own headquarters.On the other hand, a certain ideology noted for its willingness to express hatred through violence is left completely out of the discussion. Where are the Islamists? The SPLC document doesn\\u2019t mention Islam at all, although it does complain about \\u201cIslamophobia\\u201d a couple of times.Muslims are mentioned solely in the context of the \\u201cradical right\\u201d supposedly feeling paranoid hatred for them, as in this passage from the beginning of the report: \\u201cOn the one hand, the advance of same-sex marriage, racial and religious diversity, and intolerance toward those with openly racist views has made life more difficult for those on the extreme right. On the other, the highly successful infiltration into the political mainstream of many radical-right ideas about Muslims, immigrants, black people and others have stolen much of the fire of the extremists, as more prominent figures co-opt these parts of their program.\\u201dThe Southern Poverty Law Center evidently doesn\\u2019t think violent jihad and Islamist supremacism qualify groups for inclusion on their hate map, but supporting legislation to ban\\u00a0sharia\\u00a0law does. That\\u2019s a particularly obvious bit of political maneuvering in light of the entire section devoted to \\u201canti-LBGT\\u201d groups, which the SPLC interprets to mean everyone opposed to gay marriage \\u2013 but not radical Islamists inclined to view homosexuality as a capital offense.Even if the number is accepted without skepticism, and with all due respect to the noble ideal that one\\u00a0is too many,\\u00a0is 784 hate groups in an Internet-dwelling nation of 300 million an alarmingly large number? Launching such a group would seem to be easier than ever \\u2013 you just need a free website, and a few knuckleheads to read it \\u2013 while the media endlessly feeds us messages about how racism is worse than ever, but the number of hate groups declined considerably. That sounds like encouraging news.It\\u2019s evidently meant to be surprising that hippie California has the most \\u201chate groups,\\u201d but that\\u2019s not really so hard to understand, given both the size and population density of the states ranked high on the list, and the fact that they tend to be ground zero for mass immigration cultural conflicts \\u2013 Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania round out the top five. Assimilation takes time, which is one of the many reasons unrestrained immigration is a bad idea.While the article says efforts were made to exclude \\u201chate groups\\u201d that boiled down to one angry jerk with a website, the size of the groups, virulence of their rhetoric, and potential for criminal activity are more relevant than the sheer number of groups. A group of four jihadis serious about conducting \\u201clone wolf\\u201d terror attacks is far more troubling than a group of twenty skinheads who spend their free time\\u00a0writing ugly crap on a web forum.The SPLC concedes that appearing on its map does not \\u201cimply a group advocates or engages in violence or other criminal activity,\\u201d so even with its political shenanigans aside, it\\u2019s hard to avoid concluding that the point of the map is to turn the number of \\u201chate groups\\u201d into a more alarming factoid than it should be.That\\u2019s not surprising for an interest group that solicits donations and media attention by promoting itself as a watchdog of hatred. (If you\\u2019re wondering why the SPLC would put out a report that says the situation is improving, rest assured they include plenty of speculation about how the situation is actually getting worse\\u00a0no matter what its own map says, because those clever haters have supposedly found ways to hide from the watchdogs.) Hatred, like beauty, lies in the eye of the beholder, and those who have a vested interest in sussing out \\u201chate\\u201d are likely to behold plenty of it.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 255324}"
