"{\"title\": \"Wayne Brady in for Radio-TV gig\", \"content\": \"It surprised some when comedian Louis C.K. decided to pull out as the headline performer at April\\u2019s Radio-TV Correspondents Association dinner and CNN\\u2019s Peter Hamby reported on Twitter that Wayne Brady has been picked to replace him. RTCA Chair Jay McMichael (from CNN) confirmed the news in an email to POLITICO.C.K. changed his mind about performing at the dinner (\\u201cHe just didn\\u2019t want to do it anymore,\\u201d it was reported at the time) in the wake of some negative response to his more raunchy material. Fox News Greta van Susteren said she would boycott the dinner if C.K. performed.Brady is a much more tame performer, having become a household name for his work on the sketch show, \\u201cWhose Line Is It Anyway?\\u201d and he currently hosts the game show, \\u201cLet\\u2019s Make a Deal.\\u201d Dave Chappelle even once featured Brady in a skit poking fun at Brady\\u2019s squeaky clean performances.C.K. explained his decision to pull out of the dinner to The Wrap.\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t going to stand there and defend something I didn\\u2019t really feel like doing anyway \\u2026 I wasn\\u2019t that excited about it, I didn\\u2019t want to cause them problems, I didn\\u2019t think it was what they invited when they hired me. And I didn\\u2019t think about it much. It was like one morning I woke up, I heard there was static. I\\u2019m in production, so I have no reason to be in conflict with anybody right now.\\u201dIn a release announcing the Brady news, the RTCA called Brady \\u201cone of the most versatile performers in show business today.\\u201d\\u201cFresh off three nights of sold out shows at The Kennedy Center, we are thrilled that Wayne Brady will return to DC as the featured speaker for this year\\u2019s RTCA Dinner\\u201d said McMichael. \\u201cThis is an evening you\\u2019ll want to experience.
