"{\"content\": \"{\\\"WASHINGTON \\u2014  After more than a decade of wrenching national debate over the intrusiveness of government intelligence agencies, a bipartisan wave of support has gathered to sharply limit the federal government\\u2019s sweeps of phone and Internet records.\\\",\\\"On Thursday, a bill that would overhaul thePatriot Actand curtail the so-called metadata surveillance exposed by Edward J. Snowden was overwhelmingly passed by the House Judiciary Committee and was heading to almost certain passage in that chamber this month.\\\",\\\"An identical bill in the Senate \\u2014 introduced with the support of five Republicans \\u2014 is gaining support over the objection of SenatorMitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who is facing the prospect of his first policy defeat since ascending this year to majority leader.\\\",\\\"The push for reform is the strongest demonstration yet of a decade-long shift from a singular focus on national security at the expense of civil liberties to a new balance in the post-Snowden era.\\\",\\\"Under thebipartisan bills in the House and Senate, thePatriot Actwould be changed to prohibit bulk collection, and sweeps that had operated under the guise of so-called National Security Letters issued by the F.B.I. would end. The data would instead be stored by the phone companies themselves, and could be accessed by intelligence agencies only after approval of the secretForeign Intelligence Surveillance Actcourt.\\\",\\\"The legislation would also create a panel of experts to advise the FISA court on privacy, civil liberties, and technology matters, while requiring the declassification of all significant FISA court opinions.\\\",\\\"The debate has resulted in a highly unusual alliance of House Speaker John A. Boehner, the White House, theTea Partyand a bipartisan majority in the House. They are in opposition to Mr. McConnell, his Intelligence Committee chairman, and a small group of defense hawks. In addition, two Republican presidential candidates in the Senate, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, have made it clear they will not accept a straight extension of the current Patriot Act.\\\",\\\"Unlike last year, when a similar bill passed the House overwhelmingly but failed in the Senate, this year\\u2019s USA Freedom Act was drafted in delicate negotiations among the House Judiciary Committee, House Intelligence Committee, House Republican leaders and supporters in the Senate. The Senate, now in Republican control, includes four freshmen who supported the bill in the House last year.\\\",\\\"The act, which expires June 1, is up for its first reauthorization since the revelations about bulk data collection. That impending deadline, coupled with an increase of support among members of both parties, pressure from technology companies and a push from the White House have combined to make changes to the provisions more likely.\\\",\\\"The overhaul bill passed the Judiciary Committee 25 to 2, uniting the likes of politicians who rarely agree, like Representatives Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, and Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. An identical measure, by Senators Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, was unveiled Tuesday, a week after Mr. McConnell proposed a blanket five-year extension of the Patriot Act passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s listening to America,\\u201d Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, said of Mr. McConnell. \\u201cThe seminal question is how much liberty are we going to give up for security? People are on the brink. They\\u2019re scared out of their wits.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But Mr. McConnell holds powerful levers as the Senate leader that could halt the momentum or eventually alter the legislation.\\\",\\\"For the moment, Mr. McConnell and Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and Intelligence Committee chairman, seem to be increasingly isolated.\\\",\\\"The Snowden disclosures, along with data breaches at Sony Pictures, Target and the insurance giant Anthem, have unsettled voters and empowered those in Congress arguing for greater civil liberties protection \\u2014 who a few years ago \\u201ccould have met in a couple of phone booths,\\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.\\\",\\\"That has proponents of the metadata collection straining to gain support. \\u201cI think people are reacting to a program they don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Mr. Burr said. Asked about turning back the momentum against him, he conceded, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a big task.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Snowden\\u2019s disclosures prompted a public backlash that ultimately convinced President Obama to back an end to that part of the program. But since the president declared an end to\\u201cbulk metadata program as it currently exists\\u201din January 2014, little has changed, Intelligence Committee members said.\\\",\\\"Lawmakers on the Intelligence Committee pushed for changes in the legislation to allow intelligence agents to continue to track suspected foreign terrorists when they enter the United States, even though at that point they are supposed to get a warrant. Agencies could continue their surveillance for 72 hours while they obtain legal authority.\\\",\\\"The Intelligence Committee also insisted on a new procedure to use the Patriot Act to sweep up data in an emergency, but that information would have to be destroyed if the FISA court subsequently denies the request.\\\",\\\"Mostly, though, the committee insisted the bill steer clear of the amendments of theForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, added in 2008, which legalized warrantless surveillance so long as the target is a noncitizen abroad. The current legislative effort in Congress would not stop surveillance of noncitizens overseas.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI believe that the work of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee has produced a very good package,\\u201d Mr. Boehner said just before the Judiciary Committee vote.\\\",\\\"The government would still be able to conduct some bulk data collection. The N.S.A. has used a section of the law that created the FISA court for vast sweeps of phone and email data. Judiciary Committee members from both parties sought to end that data-collection avenue as well, but leaders of the committee beat that effort back, saying the Republican leadership would torpedo the bill if it passed.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf the perfect defeats the good, then bad prevails,\\u201d said Representative James Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, an author of the Patriot Act who is now leading efforts to change it.\\\",\\\"Mr. McConnell\\u2019s allies are trying to build support. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas who voted for a similar bill last year as a House member, met with freshman senators on Thursday to try to sway them to the leader\\u2019s side.\\\",\\\"Along with Mr. Cotton, four other Republican Senate freshmen supported last year\\u2019s failed House bill.\\\",\\\"Besides Mr. Lee, the Senate USA Freedom Act has four other Republican co-sponsors, including Mr. Cruz.\\\",\\\"Another White House hopeful, Mr. Paul, does not think the bill goes far enough.\\\",\\\"Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said, \\u201cAfter 9/11 I have been a supporter of the Patriot Act.\\u201d But he added, \\u201cAt the end of the day you have to look at what you can craft with the current majority.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A strong bipartisan House vote, expected as early as mid-May, \\u201cwill send a strong message to the Senate that in the House, both sides of the aisle want reforms,\\u201d said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\\\",\\\"Facing a tight deadline, Mr. McConnell is also likely to bring his alternative bill to the Senate floor soon. It is unclear whether he would have the votes for his measure, although it is possible that with a slew of amendments, the Senate could produce a bill on the floor that could be melded with the House version.\\\"}\", \"title\": \"Patriot Act Faces Revisions Backed by Both Parties\"}"
