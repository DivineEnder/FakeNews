The kids are in bed, and you have a fabulous and perfectly chilled Italian white in the fridge. It\\u2019s been a rough day with the meetings. And you just want something simple but good to cook, a just-for-one meal that won\\u2019t result in a mess and leftovers so that you can go watch \\u201cBillions.\\u201d What would you do?\\\",\\\"Well. You couldfry an eggand put it on some leftovers, or get fancy with it and make a Guy Kibbee, what some call anegg-in-a-hole. You could steam up a small pot of rice and eat it with butter and soy sauce, or knock down apeanut butter sandwich with pickles, or hot sauce, or good jam, or kimchi. Not so great with that chilled Italian white, but who\\u2019s watching?\\\",\\\"You could make Toby Cecchini\\u2019s excellentrecipe for a tuna salad compos\\u00e9e. You could make a wee version of Mark Bittman\\u2019srecipe for pasta with olive oil, garlic and pepperoncini. You couldbake a potatoand dress it up fine. Or fry a single Italian sausage over some chard and, if you can find any, rhubarb, as inMelissa Clark\\u2019s recipe.\\\",\\\"Or you could cut yourself a break for once in your life and order in some well-done spicy orange beef with fried rice and an egg roll and call yourself good. That\\u2019s an outstanding dinner for one, particularly if you eat it out of the foam container while drinking your wine out of a jelly jar and reading our politics team onthe latest from the campaign trail.\\\",\\\"And for the rest of you? This could be the week to take an early slide from work one day to try Brett Anderson\\u2019s adaptation of thepot roast recipeGavin Kaysen makes at Spoon and Stable in Minneapolis. Or to makethree-cup chicken. Or toroast salmon under a glaze of mustard and brown sugar. Or to make Melissa\\u2019srecipe for baked cheesy pasta casserole with wild mushrooms.\\\",\\\"Other ideas for what to cook this week can be found on ourCookingsite and apps.
