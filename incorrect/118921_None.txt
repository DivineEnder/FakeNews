"{\"title\": \"JFK Would Have Rejected the Iran Deal\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Kennedy believed in confronting the enemies of the United States and the evil of communism. He believed in diplomacy, too, and took that optimism to the Vienna summit in June 1961, where he met with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.\\u00a0Kennedy later recalled of that meeting: \\u201cHe beat the hell out of me.\\u201d The Soviet leader\\u2019s impression of Kennedy\\u2019s weakness may have led directly to both the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis.Unlike President Barack Obama\\u2013who seems to be perpetually surprised by his repeated failures\\u2013Kennedy learned from his mistakes.\\u00a0In the confrontation over Cuba, Kennedy made it clear to the Soviets that he was prepared to go to war, and that they had miscalculated badly. He also rallied support from the Organization for American States\\u2013the group before which Secretary of State John Kerry embarrassed himself this week.Kennedy avoided war during the Cuban Missile Crisis precisely because he had learned that the Soviets could not be trusted, and that they would exploit any opportunity to threaten the U.S., even at the risk of nuclear conflict. In standing up to them, he restored a balance of power and set the stage for the real d\\u00e9tente that would happen decades later, once the Soviets realized they could not defeat the U.S.\\u2013or, crucially, its allies.President Obama has cast these lessons aside\\u2013or, perhaps more likely, never learned them in the first place, given his administration\\u2019s disregard for the lessons of history, of which the failure of Obamacare is only the latest example.\\u00a0Instead, Obama has left America\\u2019s most crucial regional allies\\u2013Israel and\\u00a0Saudi Arabia\\u2013to fend for themselves, while ignoring Iran\\u2019s repeated violations of binding UN Security Council resolutions.The latter point is extremely important. An international consensus already exists\\u00a0that Iran must not be permitted\\u00a0to enrich uranium at all. President Obama rose to power on the argument that George W. Bush had flouted the UN and international law. Now he is about to do the same.\\u00a0Kennedy would not have wasted such an invaluable diplomatic advantage. He would have made the UN resolutions the basis for greater pressure.President Ronald Reagan, who admired Kennedy, learned from his example. As Reagan\\u2019s former Secretary of State, George P. Schultz, recalled in a Wall Street Journal\\u00a0op-ed today, one of his rules for negotiating with totalitarian regimes was to remember: \\u201cThe guy who is anxious for a deal will get his head handed to him.\\u201d\\u00a0Like Kennedy, Reagan also placed human rights at the center of his agenda, and never let the Soviets forget it.In contrast, President Obama is about to reach a deal with Iran that ignores the regime\\u2019s treatment of its own people, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its role in the murder of over 100,000 civilians in Syria.\\u00a0Kennedy would have rejected this deal. He\\u00a0was not a perfect president, but he grew in the presidency. Not so\\u00a0Obama, who wants a political victory in Geneva\\u2013forgetting that Obamacare was once a political victory, too.\\u00a0\", \"article_id\": 118921}"
