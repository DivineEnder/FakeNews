"{\"content\": \"We could hear the spit-take all the way from Arizona. That\\u2019s the home of Zuhdi Jasser, who founded the American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD) and the Muslim Reform Movement. Both groups embrace a \\u201cseparation of mosque and state\\u201d and stand against the Islamist victimization agenda pushed by CAIR.For that, CAIR repeatedly has called Jasser names in attempts to discredit and silence him. It tried to block his appointment to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in 2012 and tried unsuccessfully to have him ousted two years later.Saylor\\u2019s comments about embracing debate came during a news conference to unveilCAIR\\u2019s latest report on groups it says are pushing \\u201cIslamophobia\\u201d in the United States, along with their funders. The report includes the AIFD among organizations \\u201cwhose primary reason for existence is to promote prejudice against or hatred of Islam and Muslims.\\u201dWhile simultaneously calling for more empowered Muslim voices, CAIR accuses Jasser, a Muslim, of promoting hatred and prejudice against his faith because he disagrees with CAIR politically. For example, following terrorist attacks like the slaughter at Orlando\\u2019s Pulse nightclub, or last November\\u2019s multi-pronged attacks in Paris, Jasser will talk about the radical Islamist ideology that drives the violence. CAIR, on the other hand, insists it has nothing to do with religion.Rather than welcoming \\u201cthe full spectrum of views,\\u201d as Saylor claimed, CAIR wants to \\u201cmarginalize debate,\\u201d Jasser said in an interview. \\u201cThey simply want to continue their sense that Islam has a PR problem, and it\\u2019s not a reform issue, that it needs to happen in the separation of mosque and state. The Islamists don\\u2019t ever want to recognize they are Islamists or that they do try to collectivize our community into a political movement. Because once they did that, they\\u2019d have to recognize that there are diverse voices that reject Islamism and their Islamist platform.\\u201dIt happened to him again last week. Jasser spoke in Birmingham, Ala., about curbing Islamist extremism and the terrorism done in its name. \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s not all Islam that\\u2019s the problem, but there\\u2019s a problem in the house of Islam that needs to be addressed,\\u201d Jasser said.A local television station turned to CAIR and a local mosque for reaction. \\u201cThey said he\\u2019s a part of the problem and is only spreading Islamophobia,\\u201d the story said.CAIR\\u2019s report, done in collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley\\u2019s Center for Race and Gender, also includes the Investigative Project on Terrorism among 33 \\u201cinner core\\u201d organizations that, like AIFD, exist to gin up hatred of Muslims and Islam. IPT \\u201cclaims to investigate the activities and finances of radical terrorist groups, but makes all of Islam culpable,\\u201d the report said.No supporting evidence is provided.It is a false claim. In fact, IPT frequently cites Muslims who oppose Islamism, ranging from liberal UK reformist Maajid Nawaz to Jasser, an American Navy veteran and physician. But we also have exposed many of CAIR\\u2019s skeletons and emphasized its roots in a Hamas-support network in the United States created by the Muslim Brotherhood. We also frequently showcase radicalism exhibited by CAIR officials.Saylor\\u2019s statement about embracing debate echoes a recommendation in CAIR\\u2019s formal report: \\u201cEmpowering a diverse range of legitimate voices to persuasively contribute, particularly in the news media, to the views of Islam and American Muslims within public dialogue.\\u201d [Emphasis added.]CAIR, the statement implies, reserves the right to tell the public which voices qualify as \\u201clegitimate.\\u201d CAIR\\u2019s stated objective, therefore, is at odds with its own definition of how debate can occur.Saylor\\u2019s full statement further exposes the shallow nature of the claim CAIR wants \\u201cmore empowered voices.\\u201cOur major holiday, Eid, is a topic of significant debate,\\u201d he said Monday. \\u201cWhen is it going to happen \\u2013 because it\\u2019s based on a moon cycle? So if we can have these kind of healthy debates we want all of those voices to be trained and go out and speak to the public at large.\\u201dFirst, debate is limited to \\u201csimple practices of certain dietary requirements, or prayer or calendar issues,\\u201d Jasser said. \\u201cNone of the diversity that they\\u2019re talking about is related to core issues of universal human rights.\\u201dSecond, CAIR must ensure those engaged in debate are \\u201ctrained\\u201d to participate.\\u201cThat\\u2019s the hypocrisy,\\u201d Jasser said.When CAIR officials speak of diversity, Jasser said, they\\u2019re referring to ethnic/national background. Muslim Americans come from all over the world, from the Middle East and Asia.\\u201cIslam is an idea. It\\u2019s not a race,\\u201d he said, so true diversity includes different views about the faith and its application in modern life.\\u201cWhen it comes to intellectual diversity, they\\u2019re completely missing in action,\\u201d Jasser said.CAIR equates criticism of scholars or certain Islamist dogma with hate, he said. \\u201cThey, with self-righteous indignation, refuse to accept the fact that somebody can love the community and love their faith and still be very critical of what is normatively felt to be Islamic law. That is un-American. Imagine somebody telling some of them that they are not good Americans because they disagree with this policy or that policy.\\u201dCAIR largely has ignored the Muslim Reform Movement and has not commented on the specific principles its members enumerated.The Muslim Reform Movement issued a public Declaration of its principles. Among them:We support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by United Nations member states in 1948.We reject interpretations of Islam that call for any violence, social injustice and politicized Islam. Facing the threat of terrorism, intolerance, and social injustice in the name of Islam, we have reflected on how we can transform our communities based on three principles: peace, human rights and secular governance.\\u2026We are for secular governance, democracy and liberty. We are against political movements in the name of religion. We separate mosque and state. We are loyal to the nations in which we live. We reject the idea of the Islamic state. There is no need for an Islamic caliphate. We oppose institutionalized sharia. Sharia is manmade.To be true to its own call, CAIR needs to embrace these ideals or publicly explain why it will not. That might lead to an outcome Saylor said with a straight face that he wants \\u2013 \\u201cMore empowered voices\\u201d and \\u201csignificant, healthy debates going on among ourselves every year, every day.\\u201dNow that would be a news conference worth watching.This article originally appeared at the Investigative Project on Terrorism.\", \"article_id\": 294369, \"title\": \"CAIR Hilarity: We Welcome 'Significant, Healthy Debates' Among Muslims\", \"source_id\": 2}"
