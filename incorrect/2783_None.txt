"{\"title\": \"Biden was at Senate, too\", \"content\": \"Bunning Criticizes McConnell on Reelection    A cold war is brewing between Kentucky\\u2019s two senators, as the irascible Jim Bunning has fired a brushback pitch at Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.On a conference call with Kentucky reporters, Bunning, a Hall of Fame pitcher, accused McConnell of undermining his reelection campaign \\u2014 and he took umbrage at McConnell\\u2019s insistence that he wasn\\u2019t aware of Bunning\\u2019s future plans.\\u201cWe thoroughly discussed my candidacy for the Senate ... and [I] gave him every indication I was going to run again,\\u201d Bunning said, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. \\u201cHe knew very well what my intentions were.\\u201dAs the Republican leader, McConnell has reason to be concerned about Bunning\\u2019s political prospects. He has raised only $150,000 in campaign cash as of Dec. 31 \\u2014 far less than other senators facing competitive reelections.But Bunning said on the conference call that he didn\\u2019t raise money out of deference to McConnell, who faced his own competitive race in 2008.\\u201cFor two years, Sen. McConnell had a broom out and swept the state of Kentucky,\\u201d Bunning said.\\u2014 Josh KraushaarBiden Was at Senate, TooThis won\\u2019t make the headlines, but Vice President Joe Biden was also in the Capitol Tuesday while President Barack Obama dominated the Hill scene.And his visit was very un-Bidenesque: 19 minutes with Senate Democrats and he was out of there.The reality is that Biden isn\\u2019t even supposed to be attending the weekly Senate lunches \\u2014 a break from the tradition set by Vice President Dick Cheney, who spent every Tuesday afternoon with Senate Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he doesn\\u2019t want Biden in legislative strategy lunches, so Biden was just stopping by to say hello.Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) called it \\u201ca very positive, upbeat meeting. He talked about all the challenges we face and working together.\\u201d\\u201cHe only spoke for nine minutes. That\\u2019s amazingly short for Joe Biden,\\u201d one colleague said.\\u2014 John BresnahanMembers Reappointed to Rangel InvestigationHouse leaders have reappointed four members to an investigative subcommittee probing Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee \\u2014 the first formal sign that Rangel\\u2019s ethics troubles have extended into the 111th Congress.Reps. Gene Green (D-Texas), Bobby Scott (D-Va.), Jo Bonner (R-Ala.) and Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) were reappointed to the panel. Green is the former chairman of the ethics committee but stepped down at the start of the 111th Congress. Scott and Hastings also left the panel. Bonner is the top Republican on the committee.The investigative subcommittee makes recommendations to the full ethics committee. The presence of the three former ethics members on the investigative subcommittee signals that they had agreed to complete the Rangel probe before rotating off the panel.Rangel is under scrutiny for a number of issues related to his personal finances, including his fundraising work on behalf of the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York. Rangel has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\\u2014John Bresnahan\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 2783}"
