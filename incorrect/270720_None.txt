Joe Biden, was sent to poison the well. Host Jake Tapper asked, \\u201cThe NAACP had a convention in the last week, and they passed a resolution saying that elements of the Tea Party are racist. Do you think elements of the Tea Party are racist?\\u201d\\nThe presidential reply is as follows:\\n\\nWell, the truth is that at least elements that were involved in some of the Tea Party folks expressed racist views, you saw that on television. But, I don\\u2019t think \\u2014 I don\\u2019t \\u2014 I wouldn\\u2019t characterize the Tea Party as racist.\\nThere are individuals who are either members of or on the periphery of some of their things, their \\u2014 their protests \\u2014 that have expressed really unfortunate comments. And, again, it was all over TV, all over your network, you know? A black Congressman walking up the stairs of the Capitol.\\n\\n\\nBut, I don\\u2019t believe, the president doesn\\u2019t believe that the Tea Party is, uh, is a racist organization.   I don\\u2019t believe that. Very conservative.   Very different views on government and a whole lot of things.   But it is not a racist organization.\\nThe day before, on  Geraldo at Large, New Black Panther Party leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, in more blunt language, likewise endorsed the NAACP:\\n\\n\\u201cA black man, really, or a black leader cannot be a racist\\u2026 I have the right to use different language\\u2026 We endorse fully the NAACP resolution.\\u201d\\nObama\\u2019s mentor, Saul Alinsky would describe his disciple as a \\u201crealistic radical,\\u201d while denouncing Shabazz as a \\u201crhetorical radical.\\u201d\\n \\nThe failed attempt by radicals and their propagandist water-carriers to demonize the Tea Party recalls a 1972 incident at Tulane University in which Saul Alinsky himself instructed students in how to disrupt a Vietnam speech by then UN representative, George H.W. Bush. Alinsky told them to dress as Ku Klux Klan, cheer and wave \\u2018K.K.K. Supports Bush\\u2019 signs.\\nDavid Horowitz  writes:\\n\\nLenin once said that the purpose of a political argument is not to refute your opponent \\u201cbut to wipe him from the face of the earth.\\u201d\\nTherefore seize on any weapon, in this case a symbol of one of the greatest evil that any Americans were ever associated with, and use it to obliterate everything good America ever did. If America\\u2019s cause in Vietnam is the Ku Klux Klan, then its cause is evil and America is evil.\\nD\\u00e9j\\u00e0 vu\\u2026\\nAs with contemporary  Soros-paid stooges, Obama, the New Black Panthers, the Congressional Black Caucus, or NAACP don\\u2019t care about the facts of the Tea Party movement. Smearing the Tea Party as \\u201cracist\\u201d is a political weapon, intended to demand its members be \\u2018wiped from the face of the earth,\\u2019 or, at least, to neutralize any influence they can have on domestic politics.\\nBiden\\u2019s implicit endorsement of the NAACP\\u2019s \\u201cracist\\u201d resolution is practiced in the art of deception-by-equivocation, mis-communication. Mr. Shabazz\\u2019s in-artful declaration is intentional shock and awe rhetoric.\\nRegardless, the true meaning and important historical value of the very word \\u2018racism\\u2019 is in  swift decline.   The abuse of the word has been freely accepted and projected by the unscrupulous Cry-Wolf Left. With the help of the compliant media, it has brandished this weapon successfully for decades. It is impossible for it to resist another round.\\nLeftists\\u2019 irrational \\u201cRacism!\\u201d shibboleth \\u2014 destroyed by Andrew Breitbart\\u2019s $100K United Negro College Fund reward for proof of (planted) \\u201celements that were involved in some of the Tea Party folks\\u2019 expressions of racist views\\u2026 all over TV\\u201d \\u2014 is shamefully now a presidential talking point.\\nAlinsky would be proud of this Big Lie. But, his tactics now boomerang on radicals more often than not:\\nRule#4: Make opponents live up to their own book of rules.\\nRule #11: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, polarize it. Don\\u2019t try to attack abstract corporations or bureaucracies. Identify a responsible individual. Ignore attempts to shift or spread the blame.\\nThe Left\\u2019s brazenly attempted \\u201cracist\\u201d smear against the American diversity that defines the Tea Party is resulting in failure. Of course, results don\\u2019t really matter to these radicals, because their ends justify their means.\\nDoes it even matter to radicals \\u2014 whose morals are not governed by either truth, or common sense, but instead by a crusade for collective salvation?   No.\\nDavid Horowitz elaborates:\\n\\nThe radical organizer, Alinsky explains, \\u201cdoes not have a \\ufb01xed truth \\u2013 truth to him is relative and changing;  everything to him is relative and changing. He is a political relativist.\\u201d And that will do it. Being a radical in the service of the higher good is a license to do anything that is required to achieve that good.\\nIncluding lie, cheat, steal, assault, or worse.\\nWhich is why, ultimately, this racist gambit remains an extremely dangerous distraction for all good Americans while their government is rapidly shredding our Constitution, the rule of law in favor of the rule of men, selling and ultimately chaining us into serfdom.\\nWith the American economy on the rocks, unemployment approaching depression levels, foreclosures and bankruptcies on the rise, trillions of devalued dollars being printed, millions of gallons of oil poisoning the Gulf, and American prestige abroad being systematically diminished, America faces dire times.\\nRadical tactics, now on full display, hammer a long-war counter-revolution down upon what\\u2019s left of the free world. Good people dread the catastrophic fallout of the radical conflict, and whether or not they will be able pick up the pieces of the devastation.\\nAnd that\\u2019s just the way the chaotic Left likes it.\"}"
