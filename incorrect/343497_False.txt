Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. played many roles on the American stage: leader, orator, preacher, protester, exemplar, conscience, symbol, martyr.\\\",\\\"He almost played a role on the American screen, too: United States senator from Georgia.\\\",\\\"It wasfront-page newsin The New York Times of Oct. 20, 1961, thatOtto Preminger, the producer and director of \\u201cAdvise and Consent,\\u201d had signed Dr. King for a role in the movie. He was to appear in the cliffhanger scene when the Senate votes on the controversial nomination of the conciliatory Robert Leffingwell (Henry Fonda), accused of having once belonged to a Communist cell, as secretary of state. Mr. Preminger would not say which way Senator King would vote on the Leffingwell matter.\\\",\\\"More than just a front-page story, the casting of Dr. King seemed to be a done deal.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt is a short role, of course, and while I know people will think of it as a publicity gimmick, it is nothing of the sort,\\u201d Mr. Preminger toldA. H. Weilerof The Times, suggesting by his denial that it waseverythingof the sort. (He had previously castJoseph N. Welch, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy\\u2019s foe in the Army-McCarthy hearings, as Judge Weaver in \\u201cAnatomy of a Murder.\\u201d Also afront-page story. Also definitely not a publicity gimmick.)\\\",\\\"About \\u201cAdvise and Consent,\\u201d Mr. Preminger said:\\\",\\\"At the time \\u201cAdvise and Consent\\u201d was filmed, there had been no African-American senator since the 1880s. It wasn\\u2019t until 1966 thatEdward W. Brooke III, the Republican attorney general of Massachusetts,earned the distinctionof being the first to be elected by popular vote \\u2014 though he personally had no use for being characterized as the \\u201cfirst this, first that.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Weiler, the motion picture editor of The Times, was not about to take Mr. Preminger\\u2019s word at face value on his latest cameo casting coup. Confirmation came fromWyatt Tee Walker, executive director of theSouthern Christian Leadership Conference, of which Dr. King was president. The $5,000 fee that Dr. King was to be paid would be contributed to the organization, David J. Garrow wrote in \\u201cBearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Weiler also reached out toAllen Drury, who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel on which the movie was based while he was working in the Washington bureau of The Times. \\u201cI think it is a very interesting piece of casting to have Dr. King in the picture,\\u201d Mr. Drury said.\\\",\\\"The trouble was: No one seemed to have asked Dr. King, who could not be reached at his Atlanta quarters while Mr. Weiler was doing his reporting. (In 1961, long before cellphones and laptops, frequent travelers like Dr. King were often genuinely incommunicado.)\\\",\\\"Our \\u201cwalk-back\\u201d \\u2014 as such articles are now called \\u2014 ran the next day. On arriving in New York, Dr. King told The Times that while \\u201cwell-meaning associates of mine felt that a positive contribution might be made by my appearance,\\u201d he himself felt such a role would \\u201cnot be of any significance in advancing civil rights.\\u201d He had neither formally agreed to appear in the film, he said, nor signed any agreement to that effect.\\\",\\\"Both sides to the negotiation chalked it up amicably as a mutual misunderstanding. However, Mr. Garrow wrote in his book that Dr. King had in fact consented to the plan but then had \\u201clittle patience for the controversy\\u201d once the casting choice was disclosed. Truly, in the year of the Freedom Riders, he had bigger things to do.\\\",\\\"Never daunted, Mr. Preminger invited former Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York to play a United States senator in the movie \\u201cRosebud\\u201d in 1974. Once again, he madefront-page newsin The Times. Not that he was seeking the publicity, of course.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
