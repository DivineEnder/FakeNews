"{\"title\": \"US to Provide Military Support to Syrian Opposition\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, said President Obama had decided on direct US military support, but refused to say what exactly the United States would provide. \\u201cThis is going to be different in both scope and scale in terms of what we are providing,\\u201d Rhodes explained. Over the last two years, 93,000 people have been killed in Syria, but that wasn\\u2019t the trigger for action \\u2013 150 people killed in apparent sarin attacks was the trigger.Speaker of the House John Boehner has expressed cautious support of Obama\\u2019s action, with his spokesman Brendan Buck stating, \\u201cIt is long past time to bring the Assad regime\\u2019s bloodshed in Syria to an end. As President Obama examines his options, it is our hope he will properly consult with Congress before taking any action.\\u201dSenator Rand Paul (R-KY) was more forthcoming in a speech on Thursday to the Faith and Freedom Coalition Road to Majority Conference in Washington, DC. Paul said, \\u201cThe Senate is attempting to arm the rebel forces in Syria, many of whom are al Qaeda or affiliates. They do so out of a misguided attempt to stop the violence in Syria. Instead their actions will bring more violence and more persecution of Christians, who have long been protected in Syria.\\u201dPaul is correct that Syrian rebels have been linked with al Qaeda. In April, Syrian Jabhat al Nusra Front chief Abou Mohamed al-Joulani pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda leader Sheikh Ayman al-Zawahri. As Peter Bergen wrote at CNN.com, \\u201cal-Nusra is widely regarded as the most effective fighting force in Syria, and its thousands of fighters are the most disciplined of the forces opposing Assad.\\u201dThe Syrian regime, meanwhile, is allied with the Iranian mullahs. Instability in Syria has threatened the Syrian borders with Israel and Turkey as well.It is difficult to ascertain the United States\\u2019 strategic interests in Syria. Should the rebels win, America may face yet another Islamic state, following in the footsteps of Tunisia, Egypt, and the transitioning-to-Islamism Turkey. Should Assad win, America will have a black mark on its resume, and Iran will have won a massive propaganda victory.Ben Shapiro is Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the New York Times bestseller \\u201cBullies: How the Left\\u2019s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America\\u201d\\u00a0(Threshold Editions, January 8, 2013).\", \"article_id\": 225537}"
