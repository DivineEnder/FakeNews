"{\"title\": \"'Blood Moon' Eclipse on Holy Monday Sparks Prophecies of 'Rapture'\", \"content\": \"The series of four blood-red eclipses has sparked several conspiracy theories and amateur prophecies. A book by the popular evangelical Pastor John Hagee, Four Blood Moons: Something Is About to Change, suggests that the lunar eclipses may be a sign from God. One\\u00a0website, Red Moon Rapture, predicts the Second Coming of Jesus, noting that \\u201cJesus declared the Sun, Moon and the Stars would give signs before his 2nd coming.\\u201dBlood is symbolically linked to both Easter and Passover. Christians associate blood with the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ\\u2013which are both celebrated as part of Holy Week, which begins today. Jews recall the blood of the sacrificial lamb, sprinkled on the doorposts of the Hebrew slaves\\u2019 houses in Egypt to save their firstborn from the Tenth Plague. The moon typically appears red for the duration of a total lunar eclipse.However, Space.com reassures the faithful that the \\u201cfour blood moons\\u201d are probably not a sign of an impending Apocalypse. \\u201cSo while a tetrad of total lunar eclipses is somewhat rare, it is not extraordinarily so, and probably nothing to make a fuss about.\\u00a0After all, the only thing that happens during a lunar eclipse is that the moon spends a couple of hours passing through the Earth\\u2019s shadow, hardly something to be concerned about.\\u201dPhoto: Heribert Proepper/AP\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 137524}"
