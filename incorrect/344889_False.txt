"{\"title\": \"For Transgender New Yorkers, a Center of Their Own in the Bronx\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Eli Berry cannot go to stores or restaurants without being asked if he is a man or a woman. A mall security guard once demanded that he show identification to use a public men\\u2019s room.\\\",\\\"But soon Mr. Berry will have a space of his own: a center for transgender people.\\\",\\\"The Bronx Trans Collective, the new drop-in center near Yankee Stadium, will aim to bring together people who are often overlooked or disconnected even in New York City, which is considered to be the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement. The center will help transgender people get surgeries, hormone treatments, mental health counseling and assistance with legal name changes and job searches, among other services. It will also host regular support groups, youth counseling, meditation and yoga classes and cookouts on its back terrace.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe center is important for me because it is going to give me convenience, safety and a sense of community,\\u201d said Mr. Berry, 28, a Consolidated Edison worker who plans to stop by the center every week.\\\",\\\"The Bronx Trans Collective will be the city\\u2019s first major multiservice center dedicated specifically to transgender people, offering programs and services that were previously scattered across different sites. It is the result of a partnership betweenCouncilman Ritchie Torres, a Bronx Democrat,and a coalition of six community organizations to address what many see as scant attention to the needs of transgender people, especially in poor and minority neighborhoods outside Manhattan.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTransgender New Yorkers of color living in poverty face a level of discrimination most of us will never know,\\u201d Mr. Torres said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re creating a model for the rest of the city to follow.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The Bronx center will open next month, at a time when the challenges and the concerns faced by transgender people have gained national attention. Though they have traditionally been part of the larger gay rights movement \\u2014 often identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \\u2014 transgender people and their advocates have pointed out that their needs tend to be different because their experience is primarily about gender identity, while the others focus on sexual orientation.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhen you talk about L.G.B.T., the T is often left off, or lowercase \\u2014 it\\u2019s not really included,\\u201d said Mister Cris, the executive director ofCommunity Kinship Life, an advocacy group based in the Bronx that is part of the coalition. \\u201cThis will be putting the T back into the forefront of the services of the community.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, signed anexecutive orderthis month to allow people to use a single-sex bathroom or a locker room consistent with the gender they identify with at public parks, city agency offices and other municipal properties. One of his administration\\u2019s signature programs, the municipal identification card known asIDNYC, already allows people to designate their own gender.\\\",\\\"Mr. de Blasio, who established a commission on gender equity last year, said in his State of the City address last month that the IDNYC card had provided a transgender woman with the identification required to pick up her nephews from school.\\\",\\\"Though an accurate count is difficult to establish, city officials estimate that there are roughly 25,000 transgender residents across the five boroughs. Many live in the Bronx, where services can be limited or not well publicized. Some transgender people said they would go to a center in Manhattan to find out about services in the Bronx.\\\",\\\"Alisha King, 31, a single mother in the Bronx, used to take two trains to a Manhattan clinic for hormone therapy and mental health counseling. But with the help of Community Kinship Life, she was able to find treatments closer to home last year. Ms. King said the Bronx center would bring more opportunities.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m excited,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe need a safe space \\u2014 a nonjudgmental space \\u2014 where we can be ourselves and get to know each other.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Though the center will focus primarily on reaching residents of the borough, it will serve anyone who walks in, its organizers said.\\\",\\\"The Bronx Trans Collective will be housed in a basement office at 937 Summit Avenue, which typically rents for about $1,200 a month. For the center\\u2019s first year, the space is being donated \\u2014 along with utilities and some computer equipment \\u2014 by the building\\u2019s managing agent, Community Outreach Consulting Firm, which is affiliated with theBronx Parent Housing Network.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m a community member, and I believe in equality for all people,\\u201d said Victor Rivera, the chief executive of both organizations, who is a friend of Mr. Torres\\u2019.\\\",\\\"Mr. Torres allocated $20,000 in city funds to finance the center\\u2019s start-up costs, and other organizations in the coalition also chipped in.The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Centerprovided desks, tables and chairs.Destination Tomorrowpaid $600 for the intercom security system. The Internet and phone bills will be split among the groups. In addition toCommunity Kinship Life, the other coalition members are Islan Nettles Community Project,Princess Janae PlaceandTranslatina Network.\\\",\\\"Sean Coleman, the executive director of Destination Tomorrow, said the organizations were aiming to raise at least $65,000 to pay for operations, as well as to supply meals and MetroCards to people who use the center. So far, the members of the coalition have worked well together, he said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe all understand this is bigger than us,\\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \\u201cThere won\\u2019t be any fighting. We understand what\\u2019s at stake. How often do we get this opportunity?\\u201d\\\",\\\"D\\u2019Jamel Young, 29, a massage therapist who lives in the Bronx, says he plans to go to the center for as many services as possible to cut down on travel and to save time and money.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s frustrating and discouraging because you feel like, \\u2018Oh, what next?\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt becomes tedious, and it can get very expensive going to different locations.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The new center, Mr. Young added, is a way of recognizing \\u201cthat trans lives matter.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 344889}"
