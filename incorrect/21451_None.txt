"{\"title\": \"Florida's other winner: robo-polling\", \"content\": \"Rick Scott, the surprise winner of Florida\\u2019s Republican gubernatorial primary, and Joe Miller, the obscure GOP candidate poised to unseat Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, weren\\u2019t the only political newcomers to score major upsets this week.While not on the ballot, another group of often-maligned politicos also won big on Tuesday: automated pollsters, whose numbers in Florida correctly predicted that Scott would overcome state Attorney General Bill McCollum to claim the GOP nomination.Even as several white-shoe polling outfits, including Mason-Dixon and Quinnipiac University, pegged McCollum as the late-breaking favorite, the Democratic-aligned firm Public Policy Polling and the Republican-friendly Susquehanna Polling and Research gave Scott an upper hand. In a survey released Sunday, PPP gave Scott a 7-point lead, while a Susquehanna poll conducted a week earlier put Scott two points ahead.Scott ended up winning by just three points \\u2014 and in coming out on top, he stunned political insiders in Florida and Washington who were prepared to announce his time of death after a spate of ominous polling that was viewed as authoritative. And even if they were off on Scott\\u2019s margin, the Republican\\u2019s victory also is vindication for so-called robo-polls, which have flooded the campaign world this year despite persistent reservations about their reliability among the more traditional practitioners of the polling priesthood.PPP director Tom Jensen pointed to a few areas where the firm\\u2019s approach broke with its more conventional counterparts \\u2014 though he explained carefully: \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to run out there and say, \\u2018PPP\\u2019s better than Mason-Dixon.\\u2019\\u201d\\u201cI do just think that we anticipated a higher-turnout primary than the last two Republican primaries in Florida had seen,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe saw a Republican electorate that\\u2019s much more conservative than previous Florida primary electorates. The electorates that voted for John McCain in 2008 and Charlie Crist in 2006 were very different than what we saw last night.\\u201dThe nature of the turnout may also have been an issue in Alaska, where the few public polls conducted on the Murkowski-Miller race all shared a common trait: they all had Murkowski winning handily.The final results in Florida also bucked a raft of internal polling conducted in recent weeks for the McCollum campaign and its Florida allies. A Florida Chamber of Commerce poll, taken by McLaughlin & Associates, showed McCollum up by a powerful, 12-point margin as recently as August 12. A second survey, conducted for the Florida Medical Association by the Tarrance Group, gave McCollum a more modest, 4-point lead on the same date.Scott\\u2019s ultimate victory was the second big win in a month for PPP, which also nailed Colorado\\u2019s Democratic Senate primary in its final test of the race. On Aug. 9, the day before that election, PPP gave Sen. Michael Bennet a 6-point lead over challenger Andrew Romanoff; Bennet won by 8 percent.  The more traditional pollsters, who used the more expensive and trusted method of live telephone interviews to conduct their surveys, rejected the notion that their numbers this week had been flawed \\u2014 and offered data to back them up. Mason-Dixon pollster Brad Coker, whose survey gave McCollum a 9-point lead late last week, argued that the shift in Scott\\u2019s favor genuinely occurred after Mason-Dixon was out of the field.CORRECTION:  Corrected by: MJ Lee @ 08/26/2010 11:01 AM\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified Ipsos Public Affairs, rather than Susquehanna, as the second robo-polling firm active in Florida.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 21451}"
