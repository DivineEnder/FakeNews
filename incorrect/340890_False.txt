"{\"content\": \"{\\\"BOONE, Iowa \\u2014  The first person SenatorBernie Sandersof Vermont met when he climbed out of a Dodge Journey here on a recent Saturday morning was Caleb Humphrey. It was for good reason.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSenator, this week alone Caleb made 2,016 calls,\\u201d a campaign organizer said, introducing Mr. Humphrey.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOh, my God,\\u201d Mr. Sanders said, looking genuinely shocked. \\u201cThank you very much for that.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As Mr. Sanders walked into the hall for another packed rally, Mr. Humphrey, a 30-year-old Army veteran, explained why he had made so many calls urging Iowans to come to the event.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI haven\\u2019t felt anything like this in the three years I have been out of the Army,\\u201d he said of Mr. Sanders\\u2019s unlikely and rising campaign for the Democratic nomination. \\u201cI feel a part of something.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Support for Mr. Sanders has surged around the country, and he has drawn crowds that are the envy of other candidates. But it is Mr. Sanders\\u2019s footprint in Iowa, that most critical of early states, where that expansion matters most. A new Des Moines Register poll shows that Mr. Sanders now trails Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, by only seven points in Iowa, where he will return for another campaign sweep on Thursday.\\\",\\\"The Sanders campaign made its first hire here on May 18, an advance director with a history in student organizing. A field organizer came on next, followed by an administrative staff member, all in the campaign\\u2019s one office in Des Moines. Then, as Mr. Sanders became a national phenomenon over the summer, his Iowa operation bloomed.\\\",\\\"It now has 53 people on staff, with a \\u201crobust hiring plan\\u201d made possible by Mr. Sanders\\u2019s fund-raising success with small donors, according to his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver. This past weekend alone, he said, the campaign\\u2019s 1,700 volunteers marched out of 15 campaign offices throughout the state to knock on 17,000 doors and make 10,000 phone calls.\\\",\\\"They call it Bern-Storming.\\\",\\\"Mr. Sanders also has a growing presence in other primary states, and is putting staff in Nevada. But for a Vermont independent senator with radical political roots, no experience in national politics and little establishment backing, the key has been attracting more than 140,000 volunteers who have registered online.\\\",\\\"Mr. Sanders and his campaign say their main logistical challenge now is building an infrastructure that matches the momentum seen in polls and rallies.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe had assumed there would be a more gradual ramp-up,\\u201d Mr. Weaver said.\\\",\\\"In Iowa, the campaign is hiring professionals to coordinate volunteers and their canvassing activities, but also to better build what Mr. Weaver called a \\u201cgeographically diverse\\u201d base of support in the state. Already attracting young voters, the campaign is confident that older voters will also gravitate toward Mr. Sanders as they learn more about the 73-year-old\\u2019s positions on access to cheaper prescription drugs and onSocial Security.\\\",\\\"While Mrs. Clinton has an impressive Iowa organization, Mr. Weaver said that had not meant all the talent was locked up. With so many veterans of past Democratic campaigns available, there is a \\u201cwhole cadre of people who are not in the Clinton world,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"And the campaign has inherited some key operatives who worked for President Obama. Scott Goodstein, the founder ofRevolution Messaging, which is handling the digital operation for the Sanders campaign, ran social media efforts for Mr. Obama\\u2019s 2008 campaign. Zack Exley, who joined the campaign in August, also did work for Mr. Obama\\u2019s 2008 campaign. And the president\\u2019s former site architect and videographer are also on board.\\\",\\\"That is not to say the campaign\\u2019s field operatives sell themselves short. Mention the lack of a figure like David Plouffe, the organizing force behind Mr. Obama\\u2019s campaigns, and Pete D\\u2019Alessandro, the campaign\\u2019s Iowa director, says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s me!\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. D\\u2019Alessandro, the campaign\\u2019s second hire in the state and a former organizer for former Gov. Chet Culver, said the major crowds out West had energized volunteers in Iowa, who watched feeds of the events at campaign pizza parties.\\\",\\\"He added that larger events in nearby states also expanded the volunteer base, and that the campaign had asked supporters in Madison, Wis., where Mr. Sanders drew a crowd of 10,000, to come knock on doors in Dubuque.\\\",\\\"\\u201cMore foot soldiers,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"When Mr. Sanders showed up for the opening of his campaign headquarters in Marion, Iowa, the response was so large that organizers added another speech, said Matt Burge, a volunteer who collected cards on which supporters committed to caucus for Mr. Sanders.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSeeing his momentum grow and grow makes it a lot easier\\u201d to get commitments, he said.\\\",\\\"The crowds have become such a point of pride for the Sanders campaign that when Mr. Weaver spoke to a reporter in the vestibule of an intimate meeting with union members in Clinton, he half apologized for its size. \\u201cI\\u2019m told that this is how they used to do events before the Bernie Sanders phenomenon,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Supporters at Sanders events around the country say they learn about them from Facebook, the candidate\\u2019s own website or Reddit, where Mr. Sanders announced his bid on the Sanders for President message board, which now has 95,000 followers.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe\\u2019re in communication\\u201d with the campaign, said Aidan King, 23, a co-founder of the Reddit page who works in a Vermont-based winery. He said campaign had given the page a heads-up about the Madison event because it was its first test for drawing a big crowd.\\\",\\\"The Reddit page administrators responded by disseminating information on how to R.S.V.P. for the event with the Sanders campaign and then provided a forum to organize transportation.\\\",\\\"That is an enthusiasm that Mr. Sanders \\u2014 the self-styled substance candidate \\u2014 is using as his principal talking point on the trail. And no matter where he goes, the crowds only help him generate more interest in Iowa. And in Iowa, he and his campaign make sure they get what they need from the crowds.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe bad news is,\\u201d Mr. Sanders told supporters in Marion, \\u201cI got your name.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 340890, \"title\": \"As Crowds for Bernie Sanders Grow, the Biggest Impact Comes in Iowa\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
