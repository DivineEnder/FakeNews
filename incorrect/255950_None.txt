This is all 50 states and in ways that are very hard to see.\\u201dHe made those comments as the FBI arrested three men in Brooklyn, New York\\u00a0for attempting to provide support to ISIS.Comey said his agency is investigating suspected ISIS supporters who reside in all 50 states.\\u201cThose people exist in every state. I have homegrown violent extremist investigations in every single state. Until a few weeks ago there was 49 states. Alaska had none which I couldn\\u2019t quite figure out. But Alaska has now joined the group so we have investigations of people in various stages of radicalizing in all 50 states,\\u201d Comey said.\\u201cISIL in particular is putting out a siren song with their slick propaganda through social media,\\u201d the FBI Director\\u00a0added.In describing the jihadist group\\u2019s message, Comey said, \\u201cTroubled soul, come to the caliphate, you will live a life of glory, these are the apocalyptic end times, you will find a life of meaning here, fighting for our so-called caliphate. And if you can\\u2019t come, kill somebody where you are.\\u201dThe FBI director noted that the message \\u201cresonates with troubled souls, people seeking meaning in some horribly misguided way.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 255950}"
