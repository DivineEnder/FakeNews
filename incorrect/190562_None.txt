"{\"title\": \"Limbaugh Responds to Critics of His 'Family Guy' Appearance\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"***UPDATE: Commenter Shinsnake says it so much better than I do:   \\u201cIt\\u2019s a matter of democratizing the entertainment industry, not owning it and locking out liberals. Besides, anytime you can put a conservative up against a liberal viewpoint, the conservative is going to win out. It\\u2019s just nature. Staying away from these mediums is the very reason this problem even existed. Just entering into the the arena, conservatives have already won.\\u201dOver at  Radio Equalizer, Brian Maloney interviews Rush Limbaugh over the criticism surrounding his decision to appear on this Sunday\\u2019s episode of \\u201cFamily Guy,\\u201d or as his critics describe it, \\u201cthat disgusting program.\\u201d Below are a couple of snips from the interview, but you\\u2019ll want to read the whole thing:\\n\\n[youtube lO9igpkyqa0& nolink]\\n\\u2014\\u2013  This is my third Family Guy but first as the star. Seth MacFarlane doesn\\u2019t hate me. Or Andrew Breitbart, who he met on Maher\\u2019s show and really liked. \\u2026Seth was among the FIRST to reach out to me in Hawaii when I had that heart scare. I am not helping the Hollywood Left. His show is going to be on the air regardless what I do.BUT, the better way to look at this is that they bent for me. I did not bend to them. It\\u2019s not as though I endorse or support libs on this show. The other way around. A huge lib character becomes a conservative.When a little of this controversy erupted yesterday over why \\u2014 Rush or no Rush \\u2014 Big Hollywood was  promoting a \\u201cFamily Guy\\u201d episode,  I jumped into the fray and wrote:\\n\\nKeep in mind that Big Hollywood is not out to eradicate Leftist thought, but to stop the blacklisting of conservatives and conservative ideas and to editorially fight back against a left-wing pop culture wave.What MacFarlane\\u2019s doing fits exactly into our template. He\\u2019s entitled to his opinion, worked very hard to reach the top of the most difficult business there is to succeed in, and in turn uses that forum to further his own agenda \\u2014 that\\u2019s how it\\u2019s supposed to work. But at the same time he doesn\\u2019t completely shut us out.If everyone in Hollywood had MacFarlane\\u2019s attitude, I might be out of a job.Andrew and I both met MacFarlane after the taping of Bill Maher\\u2019s show last Friday night and he\\u2019s a genuinely  likable guy. Obviously Rush is quite fond of him, as well. But it goes beyond that. How many many liberals working at MacFarlane\\u2019s level in the world of entertainment  would hand their audience over to a Rush Limbaugh,  who\\u2019s not only the  left\\u2019s arch-arch-nemesis but THE most effective communicator on the planet for  our ideas?As far as the \\u201cdisgusting program\\u201d criticism, as someone who hasn\\u2019t watched scripted television since those bastards at Fox took Al Bundy off the air, I\\u2019ve never seen an episode and can\\u2019t speak to that. Certainly I\\u2019ve seen clips that in my opinion went too far for broadcast television, but that\\u2019s  a failure  on the network\\u2019s part. Guys like MacFarlane are always going to push the envelope. It\\u2019s up to Fox to  make sure the baby-drinking-horse-semen gags are seen only  on  the DVD. And again, as a worshiper of \\u201cThe Hangover\\u201d my only objection is that it happened on television.As far as  \\u201cFamily Guy\\u2019s\\u201d McCain-Palin-Nazi  gags,  Rush Limbaugh\\u2019s gonna be on!\", \"article_id\": 190562}"
