"{\"title\": \"Mika Brzezinski: Everything Seems 'Concocted' to Protect Hillary\", \"content\": \"Tuesday on MSNBC\\u2019s \\u201cMorning Joe,\\u201d host Mika Brzezinski discussed the latest developments in the FBI\\u2019s investigation into presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state.Brzezinski\\u00a0noted an interview Clinton conducted with NBC over the weekend, which they only allowed her to be interviewed for five minutes. That gave off an appearance that everything was \\u201cvery concocted\\u201d to protect Clinton.\\u201cThat is like everything here,\\u201d Brzezinski said. \\u201cEverything seems very concocted to protect her. And boy would I like her to be doing well right now. But Mark Halperin, tell me what you see in this. Are they trying to move this along? Are they trying to get this over with? Are they trying to even coordinate it and control it? Even everything \\u2013 we know Clinton is meeting with Loretta Lynch in private, or all of a sudden meeting with the FBI on a Saturday morning, Fourth of July weekend for three-and-a-half hours. Did they ask for it? Are they trying to move it along? What do we know? And how are we supposed to assume everything is above board here?\\u201d\\u201cWe don\\u2019t know some basic things that we often know about investigations at this stage,\\u201d Halperin replied. \\u201cFor one thing, is she subject to recall? A lot of times with high-profile witnesses like this, David Kendall, Hillary Clinton\\u2019s lawyer may have negotiated to say you get one crack at her, one time to sit with her and take as long as you want but that\\u2019s it. We don\\u2019t know whether she\\u2019s coming back or not. We also don\\u2019t know if prosecutors really looking for a crime here or run influence and say we investigated and there\\u2019s no crime at all. Prosecutors generally when they investigate a case want an indictment. That\\u2019s what they do. We don\\u2019t know what their mind-set is towards this. Everyone I talk to in Clinton world seems very relaxed about where things stand.\\u201dFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 163186}"
