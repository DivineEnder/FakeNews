"{\"title\": \"Tommy DiMassimo, Man Who Rushed Donald Trump, Is More Buffoon than Bully\", \"content\": \"DiMassimo went from playing a sick kid on the once-popular police parody TV-show\\u00a0Reno 911,\\u00a0to a sadistic social justice warrior who makes low-budget rap videos about brutal cops.\\u201cI have to bully the bully,\\u201d DiMassimo, 22, of\\u00a0Fairborn, Ohio\\u00a0said,\\u00a0describing his determination to attack Trump. But\\u00a0DiMassimo hurtling a barricade to dive past disciplined Secret Service agents wasn\\u2019t a profile in bravery; it was the latest attempt for glory by a\\u00a0serial attention-seeker.When he\\u2019s not stomping on the America flag on left-wing college campuses,\\u00a0DiMassimo is burning the Confederate flag in front of 500 contained pro-Confederacy demonstrators.\\u00a0If DiMassimo is trying to \\u201cbully the bully,\\u201d he\\u2019s doing it wrong.Being a brave \\u201cbully\\u201d would mean\\u00a0DiMassimo signing up for the Chicago Police Department and donning a uniform worn by men and women who patrol a city where black and brown men murder\\u00a0each other with regularity.Being a brave \\u201cbully\\u201d would mean\\u00a0DiMassimo holding a hunger strike in front of Ohio\\u2019s Planned Parenthood headquarters, where tens of thousands of\\u00a0black and Hispanic babies are aborted every year.Being a brave \\u201cbully\\u201d would mean\\u00a0DiMassimo placing\\u00a0his digital camera in the face of all the powerful liberal Hollywood writers, producers, and financiers who routinely marginalize minorities, excluding them from acting, producing, directing jobs.Alas, I suspect that\\u00a0Tommy DiMassimo won\\u2019t take my advice. And that\\u2019s a real shame, too.He\\u2019s so blinded by his ambition to be a bully that he hasn\\u2019t realized that he\\u2019s a buffoon.Follow\\u00a0Jerome Hudson\\u00a0on Twitter\\u00a0@jeromeehudson.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 292197}"
