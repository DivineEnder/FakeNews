What may happen is that from time to time, some may seize a chance to escape, or a deal may be done with one particular local faction that is holding some of the hostages. Over the course of a few months or years they may begin to reappear.\\u00a0Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.\\u00a0Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart.com.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 194379}"
