"{\"title\": \"16 killed in Suicide Bombing in Russia\", \"content\": \"(AP) 16 killed in suicide bombing in Russia\\u2019s southBy VLADIMIR ISACHENKOVAssociated PressMOSCOWA suicide bomber struck a busy railway station in southern Russia on Sunday, killing herself and at least 15 others and wounding scores more, officials said, in a stark reminder of the threat Russia is facing as it prepares to host February\\u2019s Olympics in Sochi.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in Volgograd, but it came several months after Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov called for new attacks against civilian targets in Russia, including the Sochi Games.Suicide bombings have rocked Russia for years, but many have been contained to the Caucasus, the center of an insurgency seeking an Islamist state in the region. Until recently Volgograd was not a typical target, but the city formerly known as Stalingrad has now been struck twice in two months _ suggesting militants may be using the transportation hub as a renewed way of showing their reach outside their restive region.Volgograd, which borders the Caucasus, is 900 kilometers (550 miles) south of Moscow and about 650 kilometers (400 miles) northeast of Sochi, a Black Sea resort flanked by the North Caucasus Mountains.The bombing highlights the daunting security challenge Russia will face in fulfilling its pledge to make the Sochi Games the \\u201csafest Olympics in history.\\u201d The government has deployed tens of thousands of soldiers, police and other security personnel to protect the games.Through the day, officials issued conflicting statements on casualties. Officials said that the suspected bomber was a woman, but late Sunday the Interfax news agency quoted an unidentified law enforcement officer as saying footage taken by surveillance cameras indicated that the bomber was a man. There was no immediate confirmation of that claim from any official sources.The bomber detonated her explosives in front of a metal detector just beyond the station\\u2019s main entrance when a police sergeant became suspicious and rushed forward to check her ID, officials said. The officer was killed by the blast, and several other policemen were wounded.Markin said that security controls prevented a far greater number of casualties at the station, which was packed with people at a time when several trains were delayed.Markin said 13 people and the bomber were killed on the spot, and the regional government said two other people later died at a hospital. About 40 were hospitalized, many in grave condition.The Interfax news agency reported that the suspected bomber\\u2019s head was found at the site of explosion, which would allow security agencies to quickly identify her.Lifenews.ru, a Russian news portal that reportedly has close links to security agencies, said the attacker appeared to have been a woman whose two successive rebel husbands had been killed by Russian security forces in the Caucasus.Female suicide bombers, many of whom were widows or sisters of rebels, have mounted numerous attacks in Russia. They often have been referred to as \\u201cblack widows.\\u201dIn October, a female suicide bomber blew herself up on a city bus in Volgograd, killing six people and injuring about 30. Officials said that attacker came from the province of Dagestan, which has become the center of the Islamist insurgency that has spread across the region after two separatist wars in Chechnya.As in Sunday\\u2019s blast, her bomb was rigged with shrapnel that caused severe injuries.Chechnya has become more stable under the grip of its Moscow-backed strongman, who incorporated many of the former rebels into his feared security force. But in Dagestan, the province between Chechnya and the Caspian Sea, Islamic insurgents who declared an intention to carve out an Islamic state in the region mount near daily attacks on police and other officials.Rights groups say that authorities\\u2019 tough response involving arbitrary arrests, torture and killings of terror suspects has fueled the rebellion.The Kremlin replaced Dagestan\\u2019s provincial chief earlier this year, and the new leader abandoned his predecessor\\u2019s attempts at reconciliation and his efforts to persuade some of the rebels to surrender in exchange for amnesty.Security camera images broadcast by Rossiya 24 television, showed Sunday\\u2019s moment of explosion, a bright orange flash inside the station behind the massive main gate followed by plumes of smoke.Another witness, Roman Lobachev, told Rossiya television that he was putting his bags on a belt for screening when he heard the sound of an explosion. \\u201cI heard a bang and felt as if something hit me on the head,\\u201d said Lobachev who survived the attack with minor injuries.The bombing followed Friday\\u2019s explosion in the city of Pyatigorsk in southern Russian, where a car rigged with explosives blew up on a street, killing three.Following Sunday\\u2019s explosion, the Interior Ministry ordered police to beef up patrols at railway stations and other transport facilities across Russia.Russia in past years has seen a series of terror attacks on buses, trains and airplanes, some carried out by suicide bombers.Twin bombings on the Moscow subway in March 2010 by female suicide bombers killed 40 people and wounded more than 120. In January 2011, a male suicide bomber struck Moscow\\u2019s Domodedovo Airport, killing 37 people and injuring more than 180.Umarov, who had claimed responsibility for the 2010 and 2011 bombings, ordered a halt to attacks on civilian targets during the mass street protests against President Vladimir Putin in the winter of 2011-12. He reversed that order in July, urging his men to \\u201cdo their utmost to derail\\u201d the Sochi Olympics which he described as \\u201csatanic dances on the bones of our ancestors.\\u201dA group calling itself Anonymous Caucasus said in a statement Friday on the Caucasus rebel web site, kavkazcenter.com, that it would launch cyber-attacks to avenge Russia\\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the 19th century expulsion of Chirkassians, one of the ethnic groups in the Caucasus.Phone and email messages to the International Olympic Committee were not returned immediately. In the past, the IOC has repeatedly said security at the games was the responsibility of the host country and that it had full confidence in Russian security plans for Sochi.In preparation for the Sochi games, Russian authorities have introduced some of the most extensive identity checks and sweeping security measures ever seen at an international sports event.Anyone wanting to attend the games that open on Feb. 7 will have to buy a ticket online from the organizers and obtain a \\u201cspectator pass\\u201d for access. Doing so will require providing passport details and contacts that will allow the authorities to screen all visitors and check their identities upon arrival.The security zone created around Sochi stretches approximately 100 kilometers (60 miles) along the Black Sea coast and up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) inland. Russian forces include special troops to patrol the forested mountains towering over the resort, drones to keep constant watch over Olympic facilities and speed boats to patrol the coast.The security plan includes a ban on cars from outside the zone from a month before the games begin until a month after they end.____Associated Press writer Steve Wilson contributed to this report from London.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 262153}"
