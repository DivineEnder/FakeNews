Weidenfeld would later work at the BBC and go on to co-found the publishing firm Weidenfeld & Nicholson.The publisher just recently financed the resettling of 42 Syrian Christian families into Warsaw, Poland, who all made it safely to Europe. The operation was carried out in total secrecy, as identifying the refugees\\u2019 names may threaten their family members remaining in Syria. Furthermore, 200 more Syrian Christian refugee families are expected to receive safe passage to Poland in the next few months, Weidenfeld said.Weidenfeld, who feels\\u00a0he has a \\u201cdebt to repay,\\u201d told The Times of Israel,\\u00a0\\u201cWe have been deeply moved by the plight of Christians in conflict-torn Middle East countries, and we are supporting the transfer of Christian families to safe havens where they can lead normal lives.\\u201dAdditionally, the Jewish National Fund\\u2013a pro-Israel organization\\u2013has stepped in to help finance the Christian rescue operations, according to the report.
