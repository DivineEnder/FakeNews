"{\"title\": \"The Hunt for bin Laden: The Iraq Connection?\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Full article at the Telegraph.This is a bit byzantine, but here\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gleaning from various articles, including this fresh one:1.  2003:  Enhanced Interrogation of Khalid Sheikh Mohammad Results in the Nom De Guerre of bin Ladin\\u2019s Courier.Enhanced interrogation techniques did not, however, produce the real  name of the courier \\u2014 at least not this earlier; it seems to have  happened later.This is giving the pansy liberals and McCain \\u201cWe\\u2019re better than this\\u201d types the pretext to deny the usefulness of such techniques:\\n\\nYes, because he did give the guy up:  he gave you the nom de guerre.Further,  I can think of a rather obvious possibility as to why he didn\\u2019t give the real name up:  He never knew it. Bin Ladin told him the codename; why would KSM need to know more than  that?  The most important practice in any covert organization is  compartmentalization of information \\u2014 the famous \\u201cneed to know.\\u201dIf KSM\\u2019s job only requires that he know the codename of bin Ladin\\u2019s  courier, in order to make contact with and identify him \\u2014 why would bin  Ladin tell him his real name?  Why would he tell him his family name  and place of origin?  None of this is necessary, and it a covert  organization it would be secret.And yes, secrets are kept from other members of any covert organization.   Terrorist groups are specifically built in the \\u201ccell structure,\\u201d such  that no cell knows much at all about any other cell, so if the members of one cell are captured their ability to give information about other cells is drastically limited.In a cell structure, the superior cell \\u2014 bin Ladin \\u2014 would know the  identity of the leader of the subordinate cell (KSM), and would be able  to contact him at will.But this is not reciprocal. The whole point is that KSM doesn\\u2019t  know how to contact or where to find bin Ladin.  So if KSM gets  captured, bin Ladin is still safe.And this would apply to his couriers \\u2014 why would bin Ladin instruct KSM  on the precise identity of a crucial cut-out who could be followed back  to bin Ladin should his real identity ever be discovered?But sure, stupid liberals:  Let\\u2019s just assume KSM knew all of this but  wouldn\\u2019t break on it.  He broke on almost everything else \\u2014 the nom de  guerre of the courier, other terrorist operatives \\u2014 but this one thing  he wouldn\\u2019t tell.Let\\u2019s just assume that. Because when you assume, you make a GENIUS out of ME and YOU.It is my belief the interrogations that led to the nom de guerre occurrecd in the \\u201cblack sites\\u201d of Poland and/or Romania.  I am pointing  that out because we have heard two stories\\u2013 that the information  originated in the \\u201cblack sites,\\u201d and that the information originated at  Guatanmo.  I think now the answer is both things happened \\u2014 this piece, the nom de guerre came from the \\u201cblack sites\\u201d interrogations of KSM.  The next piece, which I\\u2019m coming to, came from Guantanamo.2.  2004:  Enhanced Interrogation of al-Qahtani Confirms the Nom De Geure of bin Ladin\\u2019s Courier.I\\u2019m actually sort of guessing on this part, but it seems reasonable.   Here\\u2019s the new information from the Telegraph article, based on  WikiLeaks:\\n\\n\\u201cDetainee [al-Qahtani] received computer training from al-Qaeda member  Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in preparation for his mission to the US,\\u201d  according to the file, dated 30 October 2008.Did al-Qahtani reveal the man\\u2019s real name, or just that he was very  important in the bin Ladin command structure?  And did he confirm that  he was bin Ladin\\u2019s courier?Not quite sure yet \\u2014 it appears the answers are \\u201cNo, he didn\\u2019t reveal  the real name\\u201d (that is still later), probably because he didn\\u2019t know  it, but yes, he revealed this al-Kuwaiti was absolutely crucial, and  yes, he probably confirmed he was bin Ladin\\u2019s courier.  (Assuming he  even knew that\\u2013 perhaps he didn\\u2019t.  But our analysts knew that from  KSM.)And Qhatani did get the enhanced treatment:\\n\\nBut in January 2009, Susan Crawford, then chief of the U.S. military  commissions  under President George W. Bush,  rejected the proposed   prosecution of  Qahtani because of what had been done to him in  interrogations at Guantanamo. \\u201cHis treatment met the legal definition of  torture,\\u201d Crawford told the Washington Post\\u2019s Bob Woodward.Thusfar we have the nom de guerre revealed by enhanced interrogation and further confirmed by enhanced interrogation.  No real name yet \\u2014 that\\u2019s next.3.  2006 (?):  Enhanced Interrogation of an Al Qaeda Captured in Iraq, Ghul, Produces the Real Name of the Courier.Finally, the real name.  We get this, I think, in 2006.  How?  Well first of all from an al Qaeda captured in Iraq.Iraq.  Huh.  Who\\u2019d\\u2019ve thought that Iraq would end up being so crucial to  getting bin Ladin, who of course had nothing to do with Iraq and Iraq  had nothing to do with him?Further, this particular guy gets enhanced interrogations, it seems \\u2014 apparently, he\\u2019s interrogated by the CIA in Pakistan, which I\\u2019m taking as code for \\u201c\\u2018outside the jurisdiction of the United States so wink, wink.\\u201d\\n\\nThe picture that emerges from al-Qahtani\\u2019s Guantanamo file supports  statements given in the last 24 hours by US officials, who named Ghul as  the \\u201clinchpin\\u201d in the intelligence operation to find bin Laden.So far, the entirety of the case is put together by a team commanded  then by Bush.  Before Obama was a gleam in Chris Matthews\\u2019 eye, our  nation and its operatives, under Bush\\u2019s command, had used enhanced  interrogation on at least two men and almost certainly a third, that  third captured in Bush\\u2019s unnecessary war in Iraq, which as it turns out, was pretty damn necessary.We now have his real name \\u2014 and can begin the gruntwork/brainwork of  figuring out where he likely is.  We probably start with his hometown, of course \\u2014 that\\u2019s likely.  Criminals like to operate close to home.Full article at Ace of Spades HQ.\", \"article_id\": 266197}"
