But you have to wonder whether Obama & Co. has been caught napping. If there is a country in the Arab world where trying to shape events is a vital American interest, it\\u2019s Syria. For starters, the brutal regime is the linchpin to Iran\\u2019s growing influence in the region and a key transit point for weapons and insurgents heading to Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Successfully nurturing a friendly opposition in Syria could change the dynamics of the region and cut off at least three of Iran\\u2019s tentacles. Now that would really advance the cause of peace. Yet, in the one place where an active American role seems more than justified, Obama is acting like a deer caught in the headlights. Odd, isn\\u2019t it?\\n\\nSyrian forces surround protesting eastern townBy Khaled Yacoub OweisAMMAN (Reuters) \\u2013 Syrian tanks surrounded a town near the border with Iraq\\u2019s Sunni heartland on Sunday after tens of thousands, emboldened by defections among security forces, took to the streets there denouncing President Bashar al-Assad, residents said.Assad, from the minority Alawite sect, has sent troops in to towns across the country to try to end four months of protests against his rule. But activists say discontent is growing within the mostly Sunni army rank and file.Killings, mostly carried out by ultra loyalist units, are leading to limited defections within the military, which is controlled by mostly Alawite officers who ultimately answer to Assad\\u2019s feared brother Maher, activists say.Syria\\u2019s fractured opposition is also taking steps to unite, forming a 25-member National Salvation Council composed of Islamists, liberals and independents at a meeting in Istanbul on Saturday and agreeing to work toward a democratic vision.More than 1,400 civilians have been killed since the protests began in March, human rights organizations say.Some 1,000 troops and security forces backed by tanks and helicopters surrounded Albu Kamal overnight, a poor eastern border crossing with Iraq, a day after Military Intelligence agents there killed five protesters, including a 14 year old boy, residents said.The killings drove thousands into the streets, overwhelming soldiers and secret police. Residents said around 100 Air Force Intelligence personnel and the crew of at least four armored vehicles joined the protesters.\\u201cThe protesters returned several army personnel carriers today as a sign of good will. The regime knows it will meet tough resistance if it attacks Albu Kamal, and that Iraqi tribes on the other side of the border will rush to help their brethren,\\u201d said one activist in the region, who declined to be named for fear of arrest.Another activist said: \\u201cThe whole of Albu Kamal went to the streets after the killings. Several armored personnel carriers moved into the center of the town to stop them, but ended joining sides with the human wave.\\u201d###\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 265497}"
