"{\"article_id\": 337110, \"title\": \"President of New York City Police Union Faces Internal Opposition\", \"content\": \"{\\\"The head of the union for New York City\\u2019s police lieutenants laid out ideas for repairing a rift with MayorBill de Blasio. The leader of the sergeants union planned a trip to Texas to talk to black clergy members and offer suggestions for mending the police-civilian divide.\\\",\\\"AndPatrick J. Lynch, the fiery president of the Patrolmen\\u2019s Benevolent Association, found himself beating back an emerging insurgent campaign against his leadership, which erupted into a shouting match at a union luncheon in Queens on Tuesday.\\\",\\\"For weeks, leaders of the city\\u2019s five police unions have stood together, with Mr. Lynch as their public voice, after thekillings of two patrol officersin Brooklyn last month. They maintained that show of unity even as officers across the city engaged in anunofficial work slowdownthat drove arrests and summonses down and sent a message to the mayor and police management.\\\",\\\"But as the gears of the department have cranked back to life, the union leaders, it seems, are no longer on the same page.\\\",\\\"Still locked in a stalemate with the mayor, they are finding it more difficult to devise solutions than it was to articulate shared grievances over a perceived lack of support from City Hall.\\\",\\\"Mr. de Blasio, for his part, has more vigorously aligned himself with the police, just as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, is set to make criminal justice reform and officer safety central themes of his second term in Albany. Mr. Cuomo and his staff met with city police union leaders on Tuesday.\\\",\\\"On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio conceded that City Hall \\u201ccan do a better job communicating and listening and deepening the understanding of what our officers need.\\u201d He also criticized the small number of protesters who in demonstrations last month over police practices had suggested harming officers, calling such comments \\u201cquite sick.\\u201d\\\",\\\"His remarks on Wednesday came as Mr. Lynch, whomost directly attacked the mayorafter the killings of the officers, found himself lashing out at some within his own ranks during the union lunch, held at the catering hall Antun\\u2019s in the Queens Village neighborhood.\\\",\\\"\\u201cA few agitators bent on their own selfish agendas were simply attempting to use legitimate complaints about City Hall to try to repair their own weakened and damaged credibility,\\u201d Mr. Lynch said of the incident, adding he would \\u201cnot be distracted by sideshows.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In the same statement, Mr. Lynch, for the first time, said the Police Department was reinstituting \\u201cquota policies and retaliation against police officers who fail to meet them,\\u201d an accusation that appeared designed to distract attention from the strife among his members.William J. Bratton, the police commissioner, said on Monday that the department had no productivity quotas.\\\",\\\"Mr. Lynch, 51, is seeking his fifth four-year term as head of the union that represents 23,000 rank-and-file officers.\\\",\\\"He faced a similar scene in 2011, when a delegate from a Bronx precinct stood up at a meeting and read a statement criticizing what the delegate characterized as Mr. Lynch\\u2019s lack of support for officers indicted after a three-year inquiry by Bronx prosecutors into ticket fixing. The delegate suggested Mr. Lynch consider stepping aside.\\\",\\\"Mr. Lynch ran unopposed in that election. So far, no challenger has come forward this time, either.\\\",\\\"But a union official, who requested anonymity in order to discuss the challengers\\u2019 election plans before they were publicly announced, said a slate of candidates would be announced in the coming days. \\u201cWe\\u2019re the insurgents, I guess, until the time comes when we\\u2019re ready to announce,\\u201d the official said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re running. It\\u2019s happening. Lynch knows it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The shouting on Tuesday came after a delegate with more than 20 years on the force, from the 75th Precinct in Brooklyn, challenged Mr. Lynch toward the end of the two-hour gathering, Michael Hernandez, a trustee, said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhy are we at war with the mayor?\\u201d the delegate asked, as Mr. Hernandez recalled. \\u201cAre we getting anything out of it?\\u201d\\\",\\\"At that point, a shouting match ensued between dozens of supporters and opponents of Mr. Lynch.\\\",\\\"Union officials said those who spoke out included Mr. Hernandez and another trustee from the Bronx, Joseph Anthony. Both men are under indictment in theticket-fixing scandal. Brian Fusco and John Giangrasso, union trustees from Brooklyn, were also involved in the disagreement.\\\",\\\"None of the men would confirm if they were formally running against Mr. Lynch.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThese guys are no profiles in courage,\\u201d Al O\\u2019Leary, a spokesman for the union, said after Tuesday\\u2019s meeting of roughly 400 delegates.\\\",\\\"Mr. Hernandez said Mr. Lynch had lost touch with street officers. \\u201cPatty Lynch is a scripted actor,\\u201d he said. \\u201cCops are thirsty for change in leadership.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As Mr. Lynch contended with discord in his own ranks, the head of the union for city police lieutenants, Louis Turco, sent a three-page letter to the mayor in which he focused on officer safety. He implored the mayor to use his bully pulpit to denounce resisting arrest, which he said was a central element in the deaths of Eric Garner on Staten Island and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. \\u2014 deaths he said could have been avoided if each had complied with the police.\\\",\\\"In his letter, Mr. Turco also urged Mr. de Blasio to aggressively fight spurious legal claims against officers, and to lobby to fix what he called an inequity in disability pensions for a growing number of officers.\\\",\\\"Edward D. Mullins, the head of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, has said he would offer his own solutions to the mayor. He said would travel to Dallas on Thursday to speak at a forum on criminal justice and racial reconciliation atthe Potter\\u2019s House, a 30,000-member church led byBishop T. D. Jakes.\\\",\\\"Mr. Mullins said his goal was to speak about \\u201cthe N.Y.P.D. as a model\\u201d for policing in the country.\\\",\\\"Mr. de Blasio struck his most emphatic tones to date on Wednesday. He acknowledged the safety concerns that rank-and-file officers have been expressing, although he made clear he would not abandon the policing reforms he has promoted.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey have a lot of valid issues that need to be addressed,\\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, \\u201cand this administration will systemically address these issues.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
