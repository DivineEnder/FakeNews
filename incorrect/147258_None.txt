The tugboat, owned by Kirby Inland, was making its way for the Intracoastal Waterway. Kirby Inland claims it had broadcast its position at the time of the collision.\\u00a0A court document filed by Kirby Inland allegedly said, \\u201cWhile the Summer Wind knew of the Miss Susan\\u2019s position, at no time did it attempt to adjust its speed or heading to avoid the vessel. The collision occurred, among other reasons, due to the Summer Wind\\u2019s excessive, unreasonable speed\\u2026and/or by the dangerous or unseaworthy condition of the Summer Wind.\\u201dKirby Inland has demanded $10 million in damages from Sea Galaxy, according to the AP.\\u00a0But Sea Galaxy does not believe it is liable for those damages.
