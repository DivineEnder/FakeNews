"{\"article_id\": 95009, \"title\": \"Newt advised Freddie until takeover\", \"content\": \"GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich\\u2019s $30,000-a-month consulting gig with Freddie Mac only ended after the housing meltdown forced the federal government to take over the failing mortgage giant.Gingrich, who has come under fire this week for work he did during the subprime mortgage crisis, served as a consultant to Freddie Mac until September 2008 when the U.S. Treasury took control of the government-sponsored entity, his spokesman R.C. Hammond confirmed to POLITICO Thursday.Bloomberg News reported earlier this week that Freddie Mac paid Gingrich between $1.6 million and $1.8 million in consulting fees from two contracts. Gingrich\\u2019s first contract was run out of Freddie Mac\\u2019s government relations department and lasted from mid-1999 to 2002.Gingrich\\u2019s second contract, which lasted from 2006 until September 2008, put him in the position to offer top officials strategic advice. It was an unusual arrangement because it was handled directly by Senior Vice President of External Relations Hollis McLoughlin\\u2019s office. McLoughlin, who is still at Freddie Mac, is a member of Freddie Mac\\u2019s management committee and reports directly to Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Office Jerry Weiss.Gingrich did not register as a federal lobbyist under either of these agreements. The Gingrich Group was paid $30,000 a month for a total of $600,000 for Gingrich\\u2019s work during the second contract.One former Freddie Mac official said that the mortgage giant hoped, \\u201cbut it never came to fruition that Newt might be convinced to publish something, somewhere that would argue the benefits of the GSE model.\\u201dAnother source confirmed that Gingrich was hired to help defuse Republican critiques of the GSE model.The Georgia Republican has faced strong criticism, including from fellow Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann, for blaming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for the housing crisis on the campaign trail.Gingrich has downplayed his involvement with the mortgage giant, saying he can\\u2019t remember specifics of 12 years ago, according to news reports.But Gingrich was working for Freddie Mac up until three years ago when the it collapsed and all outside contracts, including its relationship with The Gingrich Group, as the Federal Housing Finance Agency was put in charge as its conservator.Gingrich targeted Democrats in 2008 at the height of the housing crisis saying they should return Freddie Mac campaign contributions.Last month at a Republican debate, Gingrich blamed Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Mass.) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), co-sponsor of the Wall Street regulatory reform bill, for causing the subprime mortgage crisis and should go to jail.\\u201cGo back and look at the lobbyists he was close to at, at Freddie Mac,\\u201d Gingrich said.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
