"{\"title\": \"NYT Reporter: 'Free Speech Aside,' Why Would Anyone Hold a Conference Critical of Islam?\", \"content\": \"By some sad alchemy, free speech, protected by the First Amendment, transforms into \\u201chate speech\\u201d once a reporter decides it\\u2019s Double-Plus-Ungood.Rukmini Callimachi expressed the classic dilemma of liberals who are forced by thwarted gunmen to confront the arguments that edge, in a horrifying manner, to the left of media consensus. Followers are expected to retweet \\u201cGeller, Unfiltered\\u201d in shocked silence.Callimachi, a journalist who has long reported on \\u201cradical\\u201d Islam, frowns at Geller\\u2019s speech. Retweets do not equal endorsements, except when they do.You mean, inflicting sharia law on America? When did Geller suppress someone else\\u2019s free speech? This user quickly protected his Twitter account, but we have screenshots.\\u201cIdiots\\u201d to be shot at? Unlike the Baltimore rioters,\\u00a0who wrecked 200 businesses, of course.A Muslim residing in Texas is alarmed by the response to gunmen trying to slaughter attendees of the conference. America must be shamed for its inexplicable, baffling bigotry which mysteriously bloomed after the September 11 jihadist\\u00a0terror attacks, the Fort Hood jihad terror, the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France, the mass Pakistani rapes of British girls \\u2014 and now the attempted assault on the Mohammed Art Exhibit and Contest. Memo to the West: Submit to \\u201cpeace and tolerance\\u201d so we can stop alarming Muslims who try to shoot up our conferences \\u2014 excuse me, enrich us with diversity.As a Christian, Callimachi finds \\u201cPiss Christ\\u201d deeply offensive. Strangely, she restrained herself from trying to kill the so-called artist. Since all cultures are equal, this is a great mystery.@JimmyTusheets @bumatari @k_mcq Not at all. As a Christian I found it deeply offensive.\\u2014 Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) May 4, 2015Since \\u201cPiss Christ\\u201d is a crucifix submerged in urine, it\\u2019s not as horrible as a cartoon, you see. \\u201cMocking Christians is one thing,\\u201d as Callimachi says. You cross a line when you dare criticize Islam. (Viciously attacking Catholics is supported by the New York Times.)@robtr2 @redsteeze Mocking Christians is 1 thing. Show me the cartoon mocking Christ.\\u2014 Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) May 4, 2015@KingShamus @kjbreazeale @FishPlantEat And fyi, the NYT has never published the cartoons of Mohammed. Not because we can't (we can) /2\\u2014 Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) May 4, 2015@OFWHAP @faithindoubt Not in the business of gratuitously offending religious minorities. /2\\u2014 Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) May 4, 2015No one who disagrees with Islam\\u2019s tenets and would prefer not to be shot to death for attending a conference can object to the fate liberals have in mind for them. After all, there were these guys, like, 80 years ago who burned crosses. Therefore, you\\u2019re a moral inferior..@rcallimachi @johnr732002 @bumatari You still claim that \\\"hate speech\\\" is not protected in the USA. Looking forward to proof, thx\\u2014 Katie McHugh (@k_mcq) May 4, 2015@k_mcq @johnr732002 @bumatari Please look up cross burnings\\u2014 Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) May 4, 2015.@rcallimachi @bumatari Drawing Mahomet, talking about it is equivalent to joining the KKK. Thanks for clarification. Fascinating\\u2026\\u2014 Katie McHugh (@k_mcq) May 4, 2015@k_mcq @bumatari Is the only way you know how to debate is by misquoting other ppl Katie? You asked a Q abt hate speech. I answered. U twist\\u2014 Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) May 4, 2015.@rcallimachi You said hate speech is not protected in America. Is that the only way you can debate, by dismissing some speech as 'hate'?\\u2014 Katie McHugh (@k_mcq) May 4, 2015Please agree with the mainstream media, or you will be un-personed. Have a nice day.@duderman67 That is not what my Tweet said. Please read and understand and don't misquote, or I will need to block you\\u2014 Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) May 4, 2015Email Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.
