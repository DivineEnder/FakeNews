"{\"title\": \"Shadow Campaign: Handful of Activists Responsible for Anti-Limbaugh Crusade\", \"content\": \"Apparently these activists are full-timers who use social media (Facebook, Twiter) to intimidate any small local business that advertises during Limbaugh\\u2019s show on their local station. These activists go so far as to pose as local customers when the truth is that 80 percent of the complaints about Limbaugh come from a state different from the one the business is located in. The big story \\u2014 and what we have learned \\u2014 is that virtually all the negativity around him over the last two years has stemmed from very small number of people in social media. We have found that 70% of the attacks are coming from just 10 people. Ten people around America \\u2013 and we know who they are \\u2014 sit at their computers all day sending out tweets, then use computer technology to amplify them. \\u202680% of the attacks come from a different state than where the business exists. It\\u2019s really amplified when you look at it that way. A small business in New York is getting letters, Facebook posts and tweets supposedly from customers boycotting their business \\u2014 when it\\u2019s all coming from a person who actually lives in Nevada. It\\u2019s the biggest bunch of nonsense I\\u2019ve ever come across. We\\u2019re definitely going to do a big job of telling the truth.The Left is genius at this kind of propaganda. It\\u2019s exactly what the mainstream media does but on a more tightly focused scale. The idea is to manufacture a reality that doesn\\u2019t exist. Regardless of public\\u2019s real opinion on, say, gun control, the MSM will coordinate with every cable news network, network newscast, website, and print outlet to fabricate a reality meant to convince 100 Senators and 435 Representatives that all Americans care about is having their 2nd Amendment civil rights taken away from them. From the looks of it, 10 dedicated activists are doing the same to Limbaugh\\u2019s advertisers: coordinating a campaign to fabricate a reality that says doing business with Limbaugh is bad for business instead of good.Follow\\u00a0 John Nolte on Twitter:\\u00a0@NolteNC\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 152280}"
