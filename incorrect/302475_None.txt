"{\"title\": \"Hillary Clinton\\u2019s Private Emails About Israel\", \"content\": \"I\\u2019ve written in the past about the State Department\\u2019s email dump of Hillary Clinton\\u2019s communications from her private server. The former secretary of state received a veritable trove of advice and information about Israel from her closest advisers. Curiously, it was mostly negative and hostile to Israel. It behooves Hillary to explain the emails and why they are mostly of a negative nature.Here are some examples.Martin Indyk was advising Clinton during her time as Secretary of State. In 2007, Indyk\\u2019s Brookings Institution, a purportedly objective non-partisan government think tank, opened up a branch in Qatar, a country that is virulently anti-Israel and which currently serves as Hamas\\u2019 main financial backer.\\u00a0Seven years later it was revealed that Indyk\\u2019s relationship with Qatar had progressed to the point that Qatar had given $14.8 million dollars to Indyk\\u2019s institute. This phenomenon of foreign governments purchasing political influence via think tanks in Washington has been well attested to in the past.Keep in mind that in the background of this concealed, blatant conflict of interest, Indyk was one of the top diplomats assigned to formulating policy and negotiating a two-state solution in Israel. The bombshell revelations of the Qatari donations compromised Indyk immensely and Netanyahu\\u2019s government responded by saying that Indyk could not be trusted. Nonetheless, during Clinton\\u2019s time as Secretary of State, Indyk had her ear when it came to Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Indyk\\u2019s emails to Clinton show a Qatari-inspired anti-Israel bias. He talks about the need to look, not at Netanyahu\\u2019s politics, but his \\u201cpsychology.\\u201d He writes to Clinton\\u2019s advisors of Netanyahu: \\u201c[A]t heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit.\\u201dIndyk attacks Netanyahu over and over as having \\u201cinflated demands\\u201d and lacking the willingness to risk Israel\\u2019s security with a West Bank that would likely become yet another Hamastan. He writes nothing of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas\\u2019s continual incitement and his calls for the murder of Israelis or the need to outlaw terrorist groups.Indyk also describes how world opinion can be used against Netanyahu, writing, \\u201cIf Israel doesn\\u2019t make a serious move, it will further delegitimize its standing internationally.\\u201d He also describes how the US can use the fear of a potential nuclear Iran to force Israel to sign a deal with the Palestinians, because \\u201cBibi needs President Obama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran.\\u201dThen there is Jake Sullivan, who currently serves as a top foreign policy advisor for Hillary\\u2019s campaign and who was Clinton\\u2019s deputy chief of staff while she was Secretary of State. Sullivan has also been revealed to harbor anti-Israel views. In one heavily redacted email to Clinton regarding talks with Netanyahu, Sullivan\\u2019s subject line reads \\u201cdealing with Netanyahu.\\u201d There is often a cavalier attitude in how many of Hillary\\u2019s subordinates refer to the Prime Minister of Israel. His name rarely comes with any titles reflecting his status as an elected leader. Rather, he\\u2019s usually just \\u201cNetanyahu.\\u201dThen there is, of course, Sidney Blumenthal, of whom I have written much in the past, especially about his anti-Semitic son Max, who recently celebrated the death of, and defamed, Elie Wiesel, prompting Hillary Clinton to disavow him, something for which she deserves great credit.Sidney Blumenthal sent Hillary an anti-Semitic article entitled, \\u201cThe preemptive strike on Jodi Rudoren\\u201d that claims the Jewish lobby \\u201csought to influence media coverage in a variety of sometimes heavy-handed ways\\u201d and says \\u201cthe pressure from these groups is relentless.\\u201d This column was retweeted by Max Blumenthal. And Hillary found the article important enough to forward it to Sullivan and her deputy assistant Secretary of State Phillipe Reines. She\\u00a0writes to them, \\u201cHad you seen this?\\u201d Sullivan responds to the anti-Semitic article, \\u201cI hadn\\u2019t. Interesting.\\u201d Reines, on the other hand, seems to have been so disgusted by this intolerant article that he surprisingly shoots back to Hillary, \\u201cMy people control the banks too.\\u201d It appears Reines was letting Hillary know that this article was deeply biased and on a par with other well known libels against the Jewish people.Jake Sullivan has also shown himself to be a fan of Peter Beinart, whom I have debated several times and someone who justified terrorist attacks against Israelis and demanded that America punish Israel for electing Netanyahu. Beinart, in one of our debates, compared the world\\u2019s foremost Jewish philanthropist and the principal sponsor of Birthright, Sheldon Adelson, to the terrorist leaders of Iran.Beinart\\u2019s writings are blatantly anti-Israel and he has become infamous in the Jewish community for his calls for a complete boycott of Judea and Samaria in the hopes of forcing Israel to withdraw and allow terrorist Hamas to fill the vacuum. The fact that Hamas or Islamic State would inevitably overthrow Abbas\\u2019s weak government, as happened in Gaza, does not weigh in Beinart\\u2019s demands that Israel be punished if it does not accede to his demands.Unfortunately, it isn\\u2019t just Sullivan. It seems that Hillary Clinton herself is a fan of Peter Beinart.After Sid Blumenthal sent Hillary an anti-Israel column by Beinart, Hillary forwarded it to Sullivan, writing, \\u201cPls read so we can discuss.\\u201d In response, Sullivan writes \\u201cFascinating.\\u201dWhen Blumenthal sent Hillary an article by his son Max filled with his usual anti-Israel drivel, Clinton forwarded the article to Sullivan with the message, \\u201cInteresting reading.\\u201dSullivan responds, \\u201cThis is really fascinating. Does Beinart get into all of this?\\u201d Hillary responds, \\u201cYes.\\u201dSullivan\\u2019s response to another Israel-hating Max Blumenthal article is to call it \\u201cfascinating\\u201d and try and compare the ideas it contains with the writings of Israel critic Peter Beinart. Of course, it was Bill Clinton himself who wrote a wild endorsement of Beinart\\u2019s book The Crisis of Zionism, in which Beinart charges Israel with everything from racism to apartheid-like conditions.I have every desire to treat Hillary Clinton fairly when it comes to Israel and, as I wrote above, she deserves credit for finally disavowing the demented anti-Semitism of Max Blumenthal, even though he is the son of her foremost advisor.But it\\u2019s important to note that when former senior adviser to President Barack Obama Dennis Ross wrote his tell-all book Doomed to Succeed: The U.S.-Israel Relationship from Truman to Obama, he described a faction within the White House that saw Israel as \\u201cmore of a problem\\u201d than a partner. Since Hillary describes herself as someone who was a great friend to Israel in the Obama administration, it is imperative that she publicly clarify her position on Israel vis-a-vis some of her advisors whose opinions on Israel are deeply hostile.\\u201cAmerica\\u2019s Rabbi,\\u201d Shmuley Boteach, whom The Washington Post calls \\u201cthe most famous rabbi in America,\\u201d is Executive Director of The World Values Network, which promotes universal values in politics and culture,\\u00a0and is the international best-selling author of 30 books, including his forthcoming, \\u201cThe Israel Warriors Handbook.\\u201d Follow him on Twitter @RabbiShmuley.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 302475}"
