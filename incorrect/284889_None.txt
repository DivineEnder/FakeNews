"{\"title\": \"The Redolent Whiff of Soviet Propaganda: Anne Barnard's New York Times Agitprop on Imam Feisal Rauf\", \"content\": \"After reading a studious account of Imam Feisal Rauf\\u2019s Malaysian activities by my journalist colleague Alyssa Lappen, and listening to an interview of the courageous investigative reporter Steven Emerson, who has compiled recorded evidence of Rauf\\u2019s Islamic radicalism based upon hours of audio taped lectures and statements,  I read Anne Barnard\\u2019s New York Times piece, entitled \\u201cBalancing Act for Imam in Muslim Center Furor.\\u201dReading Ms. Barnard\\u2019s story reminded me of Arthur Koestler\\u2019s description in  \\u201cThe God That Failed\\u201d of working for the Soviet Agitprop EKKI as a  \\u201cdelegate of the Revolutionary Proletarian Writers of Germany.\\u201d Koestler was a brilliant writer, but before qualifying for this particular writing assignment, he had gradually learned from his willing Communist  indoctrination,\\n\\nExtraordinarily well-paid for rather minimal effort, Koestler described how it was:\\n\\n Similarly, you will not find a word of criticism of the irredentist Islamic societies Feisal Rauf frequents in Ms. Barnard\\u2019s hagiography of the \\u201cpeacemaking, moderate imam.\\u201d Instead, Ann Bernard and those of her ilk consciously champion the Sharia-based Islamic totalitarianism embraced by the Muslim Brotherhood ideologue, Imam Rauf.  Koestler\\u2019s story, contrastingly, is a brutally honest, wrenching mea culpa which concludes with insights thus far unattainable by doctrinaire, willfully blind cultural relativist journalists such as Barnard. Her work epitomizes the journalism that has failed.Arthur Koestler\\u2019s experiences, and reflections upon them, are critically relevant to the present age.  Anne Barnard and an entire generation of like-minded journalists, so enamored of Islamic totalitarianism, ignore Koestler\\u2019s insights on Communist totalitarianism at great peril to our most fundamental freedoms. Will she, and they, continue on in the ignominious path of the New York Times\\u2019 own \\u201cPulitzer Prize-winning\\u201d shill for Communist totalitarianism, the utterly mendacious Walter Duranty, who despite first hand knowledge to the contrary, denied the genocidal famine the Soviets deliberately orchestrated in the Ukraine, and unlike Koestler never recanted those reports?What follows is Koestler\\u2019s own eyewitness account of the images he saw during the Ukrainian famine, and his indoctrinated mindset at that time:\\n\\n \\n\\n\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 284889}"
