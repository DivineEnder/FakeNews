After pressing his case with a Tesla manager, he was told the company would pay part of the cost \\u2014 as long as he signed a nondisclosure agreement.\\\",\\\"Neither the equipment breakdown nor the confidentiality demand turned out to be an isolated case. And now they have Tesla Motors on the defensive.\\\",\\\"After the nation\\u2019s top auto safety regulator raised questions about reports of suspension problems with the Model S, Tesla declaredin a blog poston Friday that the suspension system had no safety defects. But what set the case apart from other auto safety episodes was the introduction of a nondisclosure agreement into the relationship between car owner and automaker \\u2014 an unusual practice by an unconventional company whose founder, Elon Musk, has roots in Silicon Valley, not Detroit.\\\",\\\"The company acknowledged having had car owners sign such agreements, and said it did so to protect itself from potential lawsuits after performing a repair at a discount or at no charge.\\\",\\\"But the practice has raised concerns that it could prevent owners from reporting safety problems to theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which called Tesla\\u2019s use of such agreements \\u201ctroublesome,\\u201d and told the company not to use terms that dissuade people from reporting safety concerns to the agency.\\\",\\\"On Friday, a Tesla spokeswoman said in an email that \\u201cto remove any doubt,\\u201d the automaker would modify the language of the documents to make clear that the goal \\u201cis to benefit customers, while not harming us for doing a good deed.\\u201d She did not elaborate on how it would be changed.\\\",\\\"The safety agency said in a statement that the changes were satisfactory, without elaborating. It described its review of the Model S suspension as \\u201ca routine data collection,\\u201d adding that it had not found any safety issues so far and that Tesla was cooperating.\\\",\\\"In agreements like the one Mr. Cordaro signed, Tesla refers to the repairs as a \\u201cgesture of good will,\\u201d made without \\u201cany admission of liability or wrongdoing or acceptance of any facts.\\u201d\\\",\\\"That statement alone is uncontroversial. It is standard legalese protecting Tesla from admitting any wrongdoing by way of making a repair, said David Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University and a former director of the Federal Trade Commission\\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection.\\\",\\\"But he said two other provisions in the contract were problematic in that they seemed to muzzle consumers: asking car owners to waive the right to future legal action and to keep the entire incident confidential.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou agree to keep confidential our provision of the good will, the terms of this agreement and the incidents or claims leading or related to our provision of the good will,\\u201d the Tesla document said.\\\",\\\"Tesla said it was \\u201cpreposterous\\u201d to suggest that it was trying to prevent owners from reporting safety problems to N.H.T.S.A. or any other government agency. But Mr. Vladeck said that distinction was unimportant. \\u201cMost reasonable consumers would interpret this as a provision prohibiting them from talking to anyone, including government or lawyers or anybody else,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Tesla was founded in 2003 with the idea of establishing battery-powered cars as a viable emissions-free replacement for the internal combustion engine, and challenging many auto industry conventions. It sells cars directly to customers without franchised dealers, a practice that has led to legal battles in several states.\\\",\\\"The company is also building a gigantic battery factory in Nevada and often announces news in Twitter posts by Mr. Musk.\\\",\\\"The use of nondisclosure agreements with customers appears to be highly unusual in the auto industry. Ford, General Motors and Toyota all said they did not have customers sign confidentiality agreements in exchange for fixing cars that have broken down.\\\",\\\"Joan Claybrook, a former head of N.H.T.S.A., said requiring customers to keep quiet about repairs aroused suspicion. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know why they\\u2019d do that,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt makes it seem like they want to cover something up.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey,introduced legislationin Congress in April that would prevent companies from including nondisclosure clauses in consumer contracts. California, where Tesla is based, enacteda similar law in 2014.\\\",\\\"News of Mr. Cordaro\\u2019s breakdown and the nondisclosure agreement he signed was trumpeted by auto bloggers tracking suspension problems in the Model S, a luxury sedan whose pricing starts at about $70,000.\\\",\\\"The N.H.T.S.A. website lists 33 complaints received since October about suspension failures in the car, Tesla\\u2019s top-selling model.\\\",\\\"Mr. Cordaro, an auto enthusiast who used to make hot rod cars, said Friday that he did not think the agreement barred him from talking to the safety agency or anyone else about the breakdown his car suffered in late April. When he reviewed it, Mr. Cordaro concluded that \\u201cit was basically toothless,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt only keeps me from talking about the costs and filing a lawsuit.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In fact, he posted a short video on YouTube showing the broken ball joint from his car.\\\",\\\"Once his car was repaired and returned, he filed details of his suspension issue with the safety agency, and a few weeks later got the broken ball joint from Tesla and sent it on to N.H.T.S.A.\\\",\\\"But he was nevertheless upset with how Tesla has dealt with what he thinks could pose a serious safety concern. \\u201cIf it had happened on the highway, it could have been catastrophic,\\u201d Mr. Cordaro, 61, said by phone while driving his Model S.\\\",\\\"The owner of a vending machine company in Connellsville, Pa., about 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, he said he was a Tesla fan and had already put down deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts when they come out in a year or so. \\u201cI just want them to look into this and do the right thing,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Mr. Cordaro said he was further annoyed because Tesla, in its blog post about the Model S suspension and confidentiality agreements, suggested his breakdown had resulted from hard driving.\\\",\\\"The company said he lived on a long dirt road and noted that his car was \\u201ccaked with mud\\u201d when it was picked up \\u2014 information that Mr. Cordaro called \\u201ca fabrication.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t out four-wheeling in the car,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI live on an asphalt road and have maybe driven on dirt roads 10 times.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A Tesla spokeswoman said the company was looking into the matter.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
