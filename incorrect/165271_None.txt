"{\"title\": \"Leading British Entrepreneur Backs Brexit In Mega Mailshot\", \"content\": \"Asking readers to \\u201clisten to real people and entrepreneurs who create wealth, not heads of big institutions whose cushy lives will be disrupted by change,\\u201d Mr. Hargreaves warns that much of the \\u2018stay\\u2019 campaign\\u2019s scaremongering is by \\u201cinterests who benefit from remaining.\\u201dHe goes on to point out that \\u201cmany so\\u2013called \\u2018independent organisations\\u2019 accept payment from Brussels.\\u201dMr. Hargreaves dispels one of the most frequent talking points of the \\u2018remain\\u2019 campaign and asks readers to consider how the EU affects them personally:\\u201cA spurious argument suggests the loss of jobs; this is ludicrous. We buy more from the EU than they buy from us. It would be financial suicide for them to impose trade barriers.\\u201cAsk yourself, does the EU benefit you or make your life evermore complicated? It certainly adds a huge amount to your grocery bill.\\u201dMr. Hargreaves writes that, on Twitter, he has been issuing a reason to leave the EU daily (@PkhPeter), rounding off the letter with ten reasons to support Brexit and an invitation to \\u201cbecome part of the family\\u201d of people supporting the Leave.EU campaign.Referendum: we need facts not pontification by politicians and academics. During the next 3 months I intend to produce them by daily tweets.\\u2014 Peter Hargreaves (@PkhPeter) March 21, 2016Andy Wigmore, Head of Communications at Leave.EU said:\\u201cPeter Hargreaves, who founded a brokerage worth billions of pounds in a spare bedroom in Bristol, is a true entrepreneur.\\u201cWe distributed his appeal for voters to embrace the once in a lifetime opportunity which Brexit represents to twenty-three million households today, and we think it\\u2019s going to carry a lot more weight with the public than the timid scare stories being peddled by the bland corporate managers and clapped out politicians lining up behind the In campaign.\\u201dAs the only campaign so far to have delivered pro-Brexit literature on a countrywide scale, co-chairman Arron Banks hopes Mr. Hargreaves\\u2019 letter will guarantee Leave.EU designation as the referendum\\u2019s official \\u2018out\\u2019 campaign.Breitbart London reported last week on Mr Hargreaves\\u2019 appearance on BBC Radio 4\\u2019s Today programme where, speaking in a personal capacity, he compared Brexit to Singapore\\u2019s independence from Malaysia in 1965, saying:\\u201cWhen Singapore became independent from Malaysia, that little insecurity that they were no longer part of Malaysia, it was an inspiration. I honestly think that would be good for us too.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 165271}"
