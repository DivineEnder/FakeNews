"{\"article_id\": 197119, \"title\": \"Jacqui Lewis: Carson Is 'A Non-Threatening Black Body'\", \"content\": \"Rev. Dr. Jacqui Lewis, the Senior Minister of Middle Collegiate Church argued Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson is a \\u201cnon-threatening black body\\u201d on Saturday\\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\\u2019s \\u201cMelissa Harris-Perry.\\u201dLewis stated, \\u201cI\\u00a0would say this read on to the black body thing. You know, this is a black body that can be read on to with all of this evangelical fervor, non-threatening black body, non-angry black body, speak \\u2014 sharing our values black body. So, I would really love to hear Dr. Carson talk\\u00a0about Black Lives Matter and see how many people would stay supportive of him then.\\u201dEarlier, Lewis said, \\u201ca simple answer doesn\\u2019t work for African-American folks. I think we understand our faith is a really important part of our lives, and we know that there\\u2019s something about personal transformation, but I think the black church, and I think most black Christians, no matter Evangelical or progressive, understand the transformation isn\\u2019t just an individual transaction. We would say we\\u2019re not saved until everybody\\u2019s saved. So, the transformation of systems, the eradication of poverty, housing, healthcare, all those kinds of things, that justice pocket of faith, I think is really important for black folks. And here\\u2019s \\u2014 just to sort say a little more about the Ben Carson phenomenon, I think his narrative, I mean, as a young black person, he was my hero. I think all of us are captivated by this story like Paul, you know, I used to be violent, I was blind, and now I can see, but there\\u2019s something that is missing if the narrative doesn\\u2019t continue to evolve to where individual responsibility can\\u2019t be the only answer and that there has to be some corporate responsibility as a part of our faith.\\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"source_id\": 2}"
