"{\"title\": \"How \\u2018South Park\\u2019 Perfectly Captures Our Era of Outrage\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 342748, \"content\": \"{\\\"If \\u201cSouth Park\\u201d were a person, it would be old enough to vote, though it probably wouldn\\u2019t. That scabrous cartoon has been a one-stop shop for anti-partisan satire and blasphemy on Comedy Central since 1997.\\\",\\\"Few comedies can stay first-rate for that long. (Sorry, Homer.) Early in the current season, the show\\u2019s 19th, the creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem to wonder how well the show\\u2019s offend-at-all-costs ethos has aged. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like I\\u2019m a relic,\\u201d a recurring character says. \\u201cSometimes I feel like I\\u2019ve outstayed my welcome.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The character in question is a white restaurant owner who believes he is Chinese and speaks in a grossly stereotyped Asian accent. Maybe, that meta-lament seemed to suggest, the show had started punching down in its later years.\\\",\\\"Yet this fall \\u201cSouth Park\\u201d has gone and revitalized itself, by telling a more ambitious, serialized story and by asserting that it takes an outrageous comedy to capture an era of outrage.\\\",\\\"This season, which airs its finale on Wednesday, is built around an extended satire of political correctness. South Park, Colo., is taken over by a new school principal \\u2014 named, aptly, P. C. Principal \\u2014 and his crew of like-minded, jacked-up frat bros, who believe that being p.c. \\u201cmeans you love nothing more than beer, working out and the feeling that you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression!\\u201d They meet microaggression with macroaggression, bullying kids and adults who, say, refer to the transgender reality star Caitlyn Jenner as anything less than \\u201cstunning and brave.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But the season also targeted the rise of Donald J. Trump, a phenomenon who has thrived on a resentment of things p.c., just this week crowing that his plan to ban Muslims from the United States was \\u201cprobably not politically correct.\\u201d A longtime character, Mr. Garrison, begins a White House bid on a familiar-sounding platform of xenophobia against Canadians (recurring boogeymen of \\u201cSouth Park,\\u201d going back to the \\u201cBlame Canada\\u201d number from the 1999 movie musical). Canada, in turn, has elected its own Trump-like figure, with disastrous results. \\u201cWe thought it was funny,\\u201d one Canadian laments. \\u201cNobody really thought he\\u2019d ever be president!\\u201d\\\",\\\"In reality, Canada has a prime minister. But \\u201cSouth Park\\u201d has never cared much about political fine points so much as comedy that deflates zealots and defends the offensive, like an American Charlie Hebdo. It was ahead of the curve in asserting a right to depict the Prophet Muhammad, who appeared in a 2001 episode (though Comedy Central squelched later attempts).\\\",\\\"Now, it was as if our culture had been shining an Eric Cartman-shaped Bat-signal and \\u201cSouth Park\\u201d answered. You could see the news from college campuses \\u2014 safe spaces, trigger warnings \\u2014 and conclude that America was more radically leftist than ever. You could read a dispatch from the Republican primary \\u2014 border walls, refugee panic \\u2014 and conclude that it was more reactionary than ever. The country is deeply polarized, and between two poles is precisely where the quasi-libertarian \\u201cSouth Park\\u201d most likes to swing.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSouth Park\\u201d used to be so anti-continuity \\u2014 its episodes are often written days before airing \\u2014 that the show would kill the same character, Kenny McCormick, every week. By shifting toward serial stories, Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone have been able to make more complex arguments this season: acknowledging, for instance, that sometimes outrage culture has a basis in actual outrages. An episode on police brutality posits both that South Park\\u2019s cops are needed to keep the peace and that many of them joined the force to have carte blanche to beat up minorities.\\\",\\\"And where past \\u201cSouth Park\\u201d satires once looked at single issues, this season is sketching something like a grand \\u2014 if messy \\u2014 unified theory of anger, inequality and disillusionment in 2015 America.\\\",\\\"Even as the p.c. wars rage, the town of South Park is being gentrified: It\\u2019s attracted a Whole Foods and built Sodosopa (South of Downtown South Park), an enclave of hipster eateries and condos built literally around the house of the dirt-poor McCormick family. The townspeople are delighted, until they realize many of them can\\u2019t afford to join the few, the smug, the artisanal. Under the town\\u2019s chichi new facade is a familiar slurry of resentment (of the privileged, of immigrants, of elites) and fear (of terrorism, of crime, of economically falling).\\\",\\\"And all that, in the \\u201cSouth Park\\u201d worldview, drives people to a self-pitying narcissism that extends to politics but also goes beyond it. In the season\\u2019s darkest episode, \\u201cSafe Space,\\u201d the townspeople assign a single child to filter every negative comment from their social media, to protect their self-esteem from all manner of \\u201c-shaming.\\u201d\\\",\\\"After the boy nearly dies from the strain of filtering the entire Internet\\u2019s hate, an allegorical figure named Reality \\u2014 wearing a silent-movie villain\\u2019s cape and mustache \\u2014 shows up to scold South Parkers with a lecture that sums up this season\\u2019s Swiftian brimstone morality: \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry the world isn\\u2019t one big liberal-arts college campus! We eat too much. We take our spoiled lives for granted. Feel a little bad about it sometimes.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Affected by his words, the citizens are moved to action: They take Reality to the town square and hang him.\\\",\\\"It\\u2019s not exactly subtle, nor is the show\\u2019s argument entirely focused; the season-ending arc has involved a tangent about deceptive online advertising. (The finale may be more timely. Only a week after the terrorist shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., the episode promises a story on how \\u201cthe citizens of South Park feel safer armed\\u201d; a teaser video has Cartman getting in an armed standoff with his mother at bedtime.)\\\",\\\"And by making P. C. Principal and friends white dudes, the show sidesteps the fact that \\u201cpolitically correct\\u201d is often a label lobbedbywhite dudes at women and minorities who\\u2019ve faced actual prejudice. Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone anticipate this criticism too, having Cartman tell his schoolmate Kyle, with atypical self-awareness: \\u201cWe\\u2019re two privileged straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.\\u201d\\\",\\\"This product of two white guys does have a different vantage point from many of today\\u2019s best comedies dealing with identity issues, from \\u201cblack-ish\\u201d to \\u201cMaster of None.\\u201d But in a way, its project and theirs are the same: to deal with tensions by prescribing more conversation, even if it\\u2019s uncomfortable, not less.\\\"}\"}"
