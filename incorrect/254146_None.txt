On Sunday, Ebert played a piece by Bach that she had practiced over and over during her imprisonment \\u2014 on an imaginary violin, because the communist authorities refused to let her have a real one.Merkel also paid tribute to those who helped bring down the wall, calling its collapse an example of the human yearning for freedom.\\u201cIt was about reclaiming freedom, about being citizens, not subjects,\\u201d Merkel said at the main memorial site for the wall on Bernauer Strasse.The protests that forced East German authorities to relax travel restrictions for their citizens were spurred by changes that had already taken place elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Merkel said the wall\\u2019s collapse should be regarded as a sign of hope for people suffering in Ukraine, Syria and Iraq.\\u201cThe fall of the wall has shown us that dreams can come true,\\u201d said Merkel, who grew up in East Germany. \\u201cNothing has to stay the way it is, however big the hurdles are.\\u201dMerkel noted that Nov. 9 is a significant date in German history also for being the day when, in 1938, Nazi paramilitaries launched a pogrom against the country\\u2019s Jewish population in what became known as Kristallnacht \\u2014 the \\u201cNight of Broken Glass.\\u201d\\u201cThat was the opening note for the murder of millions,\\u201d said Merkel, adding that on Nov. 9 each year \\u201cI feel not just joy, but the responsibility that German history burdens us with.\\u201d___Frank Jordans can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter\", \"article_id\": 254146}"
