Trumpgrew up.\\\",\\\"They were saddened, frightened and dumbfounded byMr. Trump\\u2019s latest declaration while seeking the Republican nomination for president\\u2014 that in reaction to the killings in San Bernardino, Calif., last week, he wanted to ban all Muslims from entering the country until the nation\\u2019s leaders can \\u201cfigure out what is going on and why.\\u201d\\\",\\\"And they had a request.\\\",\\\"\\u201cPeople always ask, \\u2018Where are the moderate Muslims?\\u2019\\u00a0\\u201d Ali Najmi, 31, a defense lawyer and a co-founder of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, said during a discussion after prayers at the Arafa Islamic Center. \\u201cWe\\u2019re right here; we\\u2019re right inDonald Trump\\u2019s neighborhood. He needs to come back home.\\u201d\\\",\\\"For all his Manhattan pomp, Mr. Trump is a son of Queens. His father, Fred C. Trump, was the son of German immigrants, and he began his career as a developer with a house in Woodhaven. Donald Trump grew up in a stately mansion with columns on Midland Parkway, inthe wealthy enclave of Jamaica Estates, which Fred Trump partially built. Although he moved on from the borough, he frequently mentioned his experiences of taking the F train on Hillside Avenue into Manhattan, and how Queens gave him perspective on New York City\\u2019s diversity.\\\",\\\"Now, not far from Mr. Trump\\u2019s childhood street, a dozen mosques are spread out along Hillside Avenue \\u2014 there are 93 in Queens, one-third of the city\\u2019s total, according to Tony Carnes, the editor of \\u201cA Journey Through N.Y.C. Religions,\\u201d which collects data on faiths. In all, Mr. Carnes said, there are 770,000 Muslims in the New York metropolitan area.\\\",\\\"Many of them make their homes in Queens. There are close to 64,000 Bangladeshi and Pakistani immigrants in the borough, according to the Census Bureau\\u2019s American Community Survey from 2014; many of them are Muslim. The Muslim community also includes Afghans, Albanians, Bosnians and more. Halal meat shops and barbecue restaurants are bustling in neighborhoods like Jamaica, Jackson Heights and Astoria.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhat is a Muslim? You will see Muslims from every race here,\\u201d Mohammed Tohin, 47, said at the Arafa Islamic Center.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou\\u2019ll see white, black, Asian-American,\\u201d added Mr. Tohin, who works in real estate and is a member of Community Board 8. \\u201cSo who is he pointing at \\u2014 that\\u2019s the question I\\u2019m asking. Is it me? Is it someone white? Is it the brother born here?\\u201d\\\",\\\"Across the borough\\u2019s neighborhoods, Muslims responded to Mr. Trump\\u2019s comments with hurt and surprise.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI love this country, 100 percent,\\u201d said Mohammed Rana, 39, an assistant imam at the Islamic Center of Jackson Heights, who is from Bangladesh. When he heard people blaming Muslims for violence, especially after theattacks in Parisand California, he said: \\u201cIf people go and do something bad, we are very sad. Muslims never accept these kinds of things.\\u201d\\\",\\\"If Mr. Trump were to have attended the post-prayer discussion on Monday, he would have heard Yusuf Abdul Wadud speak in a thick New York accent. Mr. Wadud, 59, was born in the United States and raised Catholic. He converted to Islam more than 30 years ago.\\\",\\\"\\u201cDonald Trump is preaching hatred, fear and separation,\\u201d Mr. Wadud said. \\u201cISIS is hatred. Islam is love. No Muslim would ever pick up a gun and shoot people.\\\",\\\"\\u201cDonald Trump is using this because his crowd wants to hear this. Donald Trump is playing right into the hand of ISIS.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Shaukat Choudhury, 70, who for 46 years has lived on the same street, Midland Parkway, as Mr. Trump\\u2019s childhood home, said that at first he could not take the remarks seriously. \\u201cI very much laughed out loud,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI said, \\u2018Here goes Trump \\u2014 again!\\u2019\\u00a0\\u201d\\\",\\\"But Mr. Najmi was offended because he, too, was born and raised in Queens. His parents were Muslim immigrants from Pakistan, and this fall, he lost his bid to become the first person of South Asian ancestry to be elected to the City Council. He graduated from Oberlin College and from the law school of the City University of New York.\\\",\\\"On Twitter on Monday,he invited Mr. Trump backfor some halal kebabs and a cup of chai tea in the old neighborhood.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m outraged that anyone born and raised in Queens would say something like that,\\u201d said Mr. Najmi, who grew up in Glen Oaks, Queens. \\u201cEspecially since Queens County is home to so many immigrants \\u2014 it\\u2019s the symbol of immigrants in America.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Alhaz Mowlana A. Kalam spoke in front of Kabab King, a popular restaurant on Diversity Plaza, in Jackson Heights. When told of Mr. Trump\\u2019s comments, he shook his head. \\u201cIt\\u2019s crazy, it\\u2019s crazy,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"And he had another thought for Mr. Trump. \\u201cLook at all the mosques in this area,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe are so many that we are praying on the street. He\\u2019s not going to be president if he says something like this.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
