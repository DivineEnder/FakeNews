"{\"article_id\": 279533, \"title\": \"42nd Street: Too Big to Fail?\", \"content\": \"\\u2013 Summer, 1987:   In a stunning and unprecedented move, President Walter Mondale has stepped in and saved the Broadway musical \\u201c42nd Street\\u201d from eviction at the Majestic Theatre.   The theatre\\u2019s owners had earlier announced that they were using a standard clause in the production\\u2019s booking agreement and had given an eviction notice to the show due to low ticket sales.   Subsequently, the theatre owners have also announced that in January of next year, the Majestic will be the new home to British import \\u201cThe Phantom of the Opera.\\u201d\\n\\nBut, in an effort to \\u201csave American jobs\\u201d and keep an American musical from having to make way for an imported show, President Mondale has deemed \\u201c42nd Street\\u201d \\u201ctoo big to fail\\u201d: \\u201cThis show has been running since 1980 and has been providing jobs for hundreds of working families in New York.   My administration is determined to keep this production running and to keep these long-suffering, union workers on the job,\\u201d the President said.\\u201cCritics will say that the federal government has no business taking over a Broadway musical, and believe me, I don\\u2019t want to be a Broadway producer, but the collapse of this  show  would have been devastating for countless Americans and brought enormous damage to our economy beyond the theatre industry,\\u201d the President said in a news conference where he also announced the removal of David Merrick from his role as Producer of the show as well as a restructuring of the investors\\u2019 payouts putting top union officials in new decision making positions on the production.\\n\\nRepresentatives of the Majestic Theatre ownership said in a statement:\\n\\n\\nIn a pointed rebuttal, the President\\u2019s spokesman said:\\n\\nPresident Mondale has also announced the formation of a new, cabinet level department, the 27th of his and his predecessor\\u2019s administrations.   \\u201cThere is no doubt that \\u201942nd Street\\u2019 and other American productions have suffered from poor management decisions over the years.   So we have created the United States Theatrical Union Personnel Improvement Department (USTUPID) which will address those issues,\\u201d the President said.In a surprise move, Arkansas Governor William Clinton has been named Secretary of USTUPID.   Long seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Governor Clinton has unveiled an aggressive approach to stimulating ticket sales  for \\u201c42nd Street\\u201d:   \\u201cLet me be clear: the American people are choosing these foreign productions because we have been stuck in the past with these Broadway shows.   I mean, look at \\u2018A Chorus Line\\u2019: heck, those costumes are straight out of 1976, those girls should be wearing \\u2018Solid Gold\\u2019 style leotards, nice and high-cut with maybe a little thong in the back, you know what I mean?\\u201d\\n\\nWhile touring the new Jimmy Carter Monument For Peace & Understanding in the Palestinian Capital of Jerusalem, President Mondale remarked that the new government take-over of \\u201c42nd Street\\u201d was really about protecting American jobs.\\n\\n\\u201c42nd Street\\u201d can once more be a symbol of American success if we institute some minor management changes.   Some of the changes include a doubling of the lights currently designed for the show.   This move will not only add more jobs thus ensuring a higher demand for comp tickets, but it will also increase the heat generated in the theatre, which, we hope, will help reverse the coming ice age that has been predicted by our top scientists.   We also intend to purchase hundreds of tickets each night and re-distribute them to public school students, the elderly, UAW workers, trial lawyers, and other deserving constituents.. er\\u2026 Americans.My un-named source inside the industry has revealed that the costs of the changes to the production as well as the re-distribution of free tickets will change the financial picture for the production drastically: \\u201cIf USTUPID does what it has announced, the show will have to run at 275% capacity each week to break-even.   It is currently selling about 46% of its seats.   If it were to have an unprecedented reversal of fortune and sell-out, the show will still lose $350,000 per week.When asked how USTUPID can account for the projected losses and how the show will ever be able to make money while running at a loss each week, Governor Clinton bit his lip and said, \\u201cVolume.\\u201d~~EPILOGUE: In 1987, \\u201c42nd Street\\u201d was indeed evicted from the Majestic to make way for \\u201cPhantom.\\u201d   It moved across 44th Street to the St. James Theatre and ran for another two years.   At the time, NY Times theatre critic Frank Rich ominously referred to the travails of \\u201c42nd Street\\u201d due to the productions of \\u201cCats\\u201d and \\u201cPhantom\\u201d as a sign of the \\u201cshift of power\\u201d on Broadway.   \\u201cPhantom\\u201d opened in 1988 and is still running as of this posting.   It has run longer, employed more people, sold more tickets, and stimulated more economic activity on Broadway and across the country than any other show in the history of the American Theatre.   All without any public stimuli.   And, by the way, the theatrical unions\\u2019 pension funds have been  bolstered by  contributions from the producers and theatre owners throughout the entire run.\\n\\nStage Right  is on Facebook.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
