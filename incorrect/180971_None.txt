We\\u2019ll make great deals for the country\\u201d on Wednesday\\u2019s \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d on the Fox News Channel.Trump, in response to\\u00a0a question on criticisms from fellow candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz that he would capitulate to Democrats too much and how he would work with Democrats, said, [relevant remarks begin around 7:00] \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve been making deals all my life, and that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m worth many billions of dollars, more than $10 billion, because that\\u2019s what I do. I make deals, and you get it done. And the problem with Washington, they don\\u2019t make deals, it\\u2019s all gridlock, and then you have a president that signs executive orders because he can\\u2019t get anything done. I\\u2019ll get everybody together. We\\u2019ll make great deals for the country. We\\u2019ll take back our trade. We\\u2019ll strengthen our military.\\u201d\\u201cWe\\u2019ll take care of our vets, the vets are a huge problem, they\\u2019re being taken care of so badly, I mean, so badly,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll strengthen up the borders. Yeah, we\\u2019re going to make deals. We\\u2019re going to make great deals. And politicians don\\u2019t know how to make great deals. like a guy like Ted, you know, he borrows money from Goldman Sachs. he borrows money from Citibank. He doesn\\u2019t report it on his forms where you have to report it, it\\u2019s, you know, violation at a very significant portion, and he doesn\\u2019t report things like that. You can\\u2019t just say that. I mean it\\u2019s very sad to see it. And he\\u2019s got the other problem. You know what the other problem is, because now he\\u2019s being sued by numerous people, saying he was born in Canada. So he\\u2019s got to work that out somehow.\\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 180971}"
