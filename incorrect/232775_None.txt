As Breitbart News has reported, Pennsylvania Community College of Allegheny County has already slashed the hours of 400 adjunct instructors, support staff, and part-time teachers to sidestep the Obamacare fines.\\u00a0 Doing so will save the already cash-strapped college an estimated $6 million. \\u00a0Other Obamacare provisions, like the medical devise excise tax, have forced Stryker medical supply to cut 1,170 positions, despite the fact that the founder of the company\\u2019s grandson was among Mr. Obama\\u2019s biggest campaign donors.\\u00a0 Other medical device makers like Boston Scientific, Dana Holding Corp., Welch Allyn, Medtronic, Kinetic Concepts, and Smith & Nephew have similarly forecast the needs to cut hundreds of jobs each as the result of Obamcare.The day after Mr. Obama\\u2019s reelection, a Las Vegas employer fired 22 of his 114 employees citing Obamacare regulations as the culprit. Christine Ippolito of Compass Workforce Solutions says companies just under the 50 employee threshold now plan to hold off on hiring to avoid triggering the $2,000-per worker penalty.Ernie Canadeo, the president of EGC Group advertising agency, agrees.\\u00a0 Mr. Canadeo says he had planned to hire 10 workers this year, but may wait so as not to cross the 50-worker mark.The looming Obamacare layoffs and hiring freezes come as a Labor Department report announced today that the unemployment rate remains at 7.8% (revised up from the originally reported 7.7%).\\u00a0 Presently, 22.6 million Americans are either unemployed, underemployed, or marginally attached to the work force. \\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 232775}"
