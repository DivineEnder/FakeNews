"{\"title\": \"Retired General on Syria: Limited Strike Not 'Effective Deterrent' Historically\", \"content\": \"Cartwright also\\u00a0spoke of what the military will do now that Obama has decided to wait for Congressional approval on a Syria attack.Stephanopoulos asked Cartwright to explain what happens now that the military has \\u201cramped all this up\\u201d only to be put on hold. Cartwright responded:[Starting at the tactical level] the first question is can the forces\\u2019 posture stay on station for a month or two months, until we go to Congress, until a decision is reached. And the answer to that is yes, they can do that. The second question is will the targets stay that they have\\u2026planned [to hit] to carry out this strategy\\u2013will they be there when we go? Again, most of the targets associated with this limited strike are fixed\\u2013they\\u2019re buildings, they\\u2019re facilities, they\\u2019re areas, so they\\u2019re going to be there.Cartwright said the U.S. will not strike the chemical weapons themselves for fear of \\u201cdispersal of the gases.\\u201d He said under the idea of preventing further use of those weapons, we need to target \\u201cplaces where production is done\\u201d and \\u201cbridges\\u201d and other infrastructure necessary to the movement of such weapons.Cartwright added that he does not have much faith in preventing future use of the weapons.\\u00a0Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 224275}"
