"{\"title\": \"China\\u2019s global currency ambitions falling flat with central banks \", \"content\": \"The Chinese yuan accounted for only 1.1% of global foreign-exchange reserves last year, the latest sign that China is meeting resistance in its effort to make the yuan a global currency.A quarterly report from the International Monetary Fund on Friday showed that central banks held $84.5 billion in yuan reserves in the fourth quarter, the first time the IMF reported central bank holdings of the Chinese currency.China has been taking steps in recent years to encourage more central banks and other investors to hold the currency, such as providing more details about its currency policies and its own reserve holdings.The government views broader acceptance of the yuan, also known as the renminbi, as a way to expand China\\u2019s global influence. If central bankers boosted their yuan holdings, it could also boost the yuan\\u2019s value and ease pressure on China to stabilize the currency using its own reserves. China\\u2019s reserve level dipped below $3 trillion in January after the central bank stepped up efforts to defend the currency, though reserves rebounded in February.The central bank\\u2019s limited yuan positions indicate that global policy makers remain cautious toward China. They are worried about Beijing\\u2019s tight control over the currency, still-limited transparency in its financial markets and rising debt that many fear is distorting prices. The People\\u2019s Bank of China sets the yuan\\u2019s value daily and then allows it to trade within a 2% range on either side of the fix.\\u201cChina is the second-largest economy and for its currency to only account for 1% of foreign-exchange reserves is very modest,\\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and the former head of IMF\\u2019s China division. \\u201cThis is certainly not showing a path for the renminbi becoming a world-class reserve currency.\\u201dInvestors also worry that Beijing could devalue the currency again, as it did in August 2015, when a surprise 2% devaluation rattled markets around the globe.\\u201cThe concern is that you stick a lot of official reserves with a currency that\\u2019s overvalued and might be subject to a devaluation at some point,\\u201d said Sebastien Galy, a macro strategist at \\n        Deutsche Bank\\n        .China achieved an important milestone in October, when the yuan was added to the IMF\\u2019s elite basket of reserve currencies that the organization uses to denominate for emergency loans.Some analysts had expected that decision would lead central banks to boost their holdings in the yuan. The IMF assigned it an 11% weighting in the basket, less than the dollar and euro but ahead of the Japanese yen and British pound.Based on the size of the Chinese economy, central banks should be holding about 20% of reserves in the yuan, Deutsche Bank said. But the German bank predicted before the release of the IMF numbers that the yuan would make up 1% to 2% of global central-bank reserves.Allocations to the yuan have been little-changed in recent years. An IMF report estimated that about 1.1% of the official foreign reserves were held in yuan in 2014, though the countries included in that report differed from those in Friday\\u2019s data.The modest central bank holdings are a setback for China after it spent years trying to globalize its markets and economy. As part of those efforts, China has taken steps to open its onshore stock and bond markets to foreign investors and allow its currency to move more in-line with market forces.Last summer, global index provider \\n        MSCI\\n         Inc.\\n       said it wouldn\\u2019t include China\\u2019s stocks in its benchmark emerging markets index amid concerns about the market\\u2019s openness and transparency.In recent months, the PBOC has indicated keeping the yuan stable is a priority while the internationalization of the currency remains a medium- to long-term goal.Another risk is that Chinese assets could be roiled by rising trade tensions. The Trump administration has threatened to name China a currency manipulator and impose tariffs on its goods. President Trump tweeted on Thursday that a meeting scheduled next week with Chinese leader \\n      Xi Jinping\\n       \\u201cwill be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits.\\u201d\\u201cThere\\u2019s always the risk of a trade war, and we know who would suffer more: Asia, not the U.S.,\\u201d said Mr. GalyWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\", \"source_id\": 22245, \"article_id\": 349410}"
