"{\"title\": \"Thousands Take to the Streets Worldwide To Demand More Taxes, Less Energy\", \"content\": \"Never willing to let a feel-good bandwagon pass them by, various actors, artists, activists and politicians are taking part by marching and giving rousing speeches, urging more government funding for alternative technologies, higher taxes, more regulation of business and reduced use of cheap carbon fuels. The London rally, which took place this lunchtime, draw thousands. It began with a \\u201cmulti-faith gathering\\u201d at the Victoria Embankment Gardens, before the ralliers marched to Parliament Square, outside the Palace of Westminster to listen to speeches. At one point the mass of people reached from Parliament Square all the way back to Temple, a distance of about a mile. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a vast latent constituency of people out there alarmed about climate change,\\u201d said Ricken Patel, head of the international Avaaz campaign group which has been instrumental in helping to organise the rallies. \\u201cBut, for years, nobody has put up a banner that said that \\u2018this is the time, this is the place, to show that you care\\u2019. The People\\u2019s Climate March is that banner.\\u201d#PeoplesClimate march reaches end.

We can\\u2019t go on pretending nothing\\u2019s happening\\u201d. According to data taken from the Remote Sensing System, a satellite-based monthly global mean lower-troposphere temperature dataset, this month marks 18 years of no global warming \\u2013 the longest continuous period with no warming ever recorded since the satellite system was first launched in 1979, despite the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere increasing significantly over that time.

Therefore I will be marching, along with several grandchildren, with Citizens Climate Lobby, which advocates fee-and-dividend.\\u201dLast year, British households and businesses paid a record-breaking \\u00a343 billion in green taxes, according to Treasury figures, soaring by over 30 percent in the last decade. Total green tax revenues in 2013 equated to \\u00a31,629 for every household in the UK, and over \\u00a3500 million was spent on renewable energy projects. Victoria Bamford, a 66 year old gardener travelled from her home in Wales to attend the London march today. Speaking to The Guardian she said \\u201cYou cannot rely on the seasons any more, and plants are getting stressed and ill. I\\u2019m no bloody expert, but we have to tackle the fossil fuel business. But I don\\u2019t think the government is doing anything.\\u201d#climatemarch Thousands march in London pic.twitter.com/BywC7aEfvf\\u2014 Salisbury Greenpeace (@SalGreenpeace) September 21, 2014\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 202821}"
