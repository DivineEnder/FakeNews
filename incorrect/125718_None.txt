"{\"title\": \"NBC Preps 'Immaculate Conception' Show\", \"content\": \"As the show unfolds, we will see the lives of \\u201cthose few children who survived\\u201d their miraculous birth obviating Christianity\\u2019s central concept that only the son of God was so born. The series will focus on these special humans who are \\u201cdestined to change the world.\\u201dConception is being penned by writer John Glenn who is responsible for such shows as the upcoming Fix It Men for ABC and the movie Abducted for Paramount.Glenn also wrote the Shia LaBeouf vehicle Eagle Eye and The Lazarus Project starring Paul Walker.The writer also sold several other concepts recently that never went to series.This project is a rare \\u201cput pilot\\u201d for NBC, almost assuring it will go to series. A put pilot is a contract deal that places penalties on the network if the show does not go to series. Such contracts are rare due to their expense and because of the box into which it places network executives.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 125718}"
