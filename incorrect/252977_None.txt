"{\"title\": \"Prosecutor: Argentinian President Plotted to Cover Up Iranian Role in AMIA Bombing\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"An Argentinian prosecutor is suing Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and the Argentinian government for allegedly covering up Iranian involvement in the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, the Algemeiner reports.According to Argentine newspaper La Nacion, Argentinian special prosecutor Alberto Nisman uncovered a plot designed by the President to overlook Iran\\u2019s role in the terrorist attack. The motivation behind the plan was to \\u201cmake a geopolitical move closer to the Islamic Republic of Iran, and to establish full economic ties\\u201d and to help alleviate \\u201cArgentina\\u2019s energy crisis through a \\u2018grain for oil\\u2019 deal.\\u201dNisman claims that President Kirchner created a backdoor channel with Iran to collude on the plot. Other major figures have also been accused of engaging in secret talks with Iran on the matter, including members of the Argentinian intelligence services, a parliamentarian, pro-government activists and Jorge \\u201cYussuf\\u201d Khalil, a major figure in Argentina\\u2019s Muslim community who reportedly maintains close relations with Iran.\\u201cEvery message from the President was communicated in detail to the fugitive Mohsen Rabbani, who was Iran\\u2019s Cultural Attache in Buenos Aires at the time of the attack,\\u201d according to La Nacion.Some of the evidence was derived from phone taps. Nisman\\u2019s formal complaint \\u201cpresents irrefutable evidence that Cristina Fern\\u00e1ndez de Kirchner ordered Federal Planning Minister Julio De Vido to meet with D\\u2019Elia [former member of Kirchner\\u2019s cabinet], and through him, to transmit the government\\u2019s interest in swapping grain for oil.\\u201dEamonn MacDonagh, a Buenos Aires based political analyst, told The Algemeinerabout the significance of Nisman\\u2019s phone records acquisition.\\u201cIf he has hundreds of pages of phone taps, that can only indicate that some part of Argentina\\u2019s vast and unaccountable intelligence system is assisting him,\\u201d said Macdonagh.These developments come two years following the memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran regarding a \\u201ctruth commission\\u201d into the AMIA terrorist attacks which killed 85 and injured many more.These allegations would demonstrate that the President of Argentina and other senior officials are directly responsible for attempting to cover up the worst terrorist attack in Argentina\\u2019s history.This post originally appeared at the Investigative Project on Terrorism.\\u00a0\", \"article_id\": 252977}"
