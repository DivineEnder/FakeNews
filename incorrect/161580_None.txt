Get better at life!\\u2014 Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) February 18, 2015Olbermann, who has used his own Twitter account to feud with the likes of the New York Daily News, a 13-year-old girl and NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson, offered up some of his own advice for Kaepernick.\\u201cThat\\u2019s it? Why? What the hell, dude? This guy attacked you on Twitter. You know why he did? Because athletes and actors and politicians and other public figures, even the ones down at the bottom list like me \\u2014 we\\u2019re the last group in America you can viciously attack in public and not get blasted for doing so. Don\\u2019t stop, Colin, go in. Keep going in. your goal is to get the guy to delete his account. That is the goal.\\u201dHe added, \\u201cRead his old tweets. This one to Sharyl Attkisson, \\u2018Looks by some of these commets she is right.\\u2019 Commets? You retweet it with different notes that strip him of his dignity like \\u2018Commets? Like Halley\\u2019s comets? You read them on the Internet, bro?\\u2019 You retweet it again with \\u2018Spellcheck broken, moron?\\u2019 The point is annihilation. You want to give this guy a tsunami of abuse on Twitter. You want him to delete his account. You want people he works with to abuse him in the office. You want him to change his name legally. Once you\\u2019re attacked on Twitter, Colin, it is war. There are rules here? There are no rules here. He brings a knife, you bring a nuclear weapon. Now, Colin, you can guess if maybe I\\u2019m just kidding. We\\u2019re not kidding. We\\u2019re kidding.\\u201dFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 161580}"
