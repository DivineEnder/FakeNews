"{\"content\": \"{\\\"A raw noise-rock pioneer and a fancy interior designer meet somewhere in the middle.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI love your outfit,\\u201d Michael Smith says as he looks up from a sheaf of fabric swatches to greet Kim Gordon, dressed on a hot Los Angeles afternoon in a gray A-line dress. \\u201cIt\\u2019s deliciously matte\\u201d \\u2014 a simple but surprisingly effective icebreaker for this arranged meeting. Smith, a well-known, high-end interior designer who has been the White House decorator since President Obama was first inaugurated in 2009, often spends time entertaining dignitaries and celebrities in Madrid, where his partner, James Costos, is the U.S. Ambassador to Spain and Andorra. Gordon is an indie-rock legend who co-founded Sonic Youth, playing bass and singing for the seminal alternative group until their final performance in 2011. She is also the author of last year\\u2019s acclaimed memoir \\u201cGirl in a Band,\\u201d and an artist who experiments with paint and Plexiglas, and has shown at Gagosian in London and White Columns in New York.\\\",\\\"We caught the pair, who seem to come from vastly different milieus but who both once lived in nearby Santa Monica, as they were heading out of town, Gordon to Seattle for \\u201csome art fair,\\u201d Smith to Washington, D.C., for the president\\u2019s birthday.\\\",\\\"Michael Smith:So, I was Googling you: We both went to the Otis College of Art and Design. It has a new location by the Los Angeles airport, but it used to be in MacArthur Park where there were a lot of artists and studios.\\\",\\\"Kim Gordon:I thought the neighborhood was mostly just homeless people. I had a painting teacher there. I forget his name, but I remember bringing in these beautiful car brochures where I\\u2019d painted in the windows. I said, \\u201cThese are my paintings,\\u201d and he just said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never failed anyone before.\\u201d He didn\\u2019t end up failing me, but he called me a fascist.\\\",\\\"Smith:I was such an outsider. But at art school everyone is. It\\u2019s like popcorn. Everyone is popping at a different time. When you go to art school in California you\\u2019re kind of robbed in the sense that everything is so New York-centric.\\\",\\\"Gordon:There\\u2019s been so much going on in L.A., though, since the \\u201960s, but people are just now really mining it. When I first moved to New York I started seeing things around SoHo that reminded me of California, that were trying to be more bohemian, like the way plants were hung with macram\\u00e9. I had a sense that the California aesthetic was starting to be exported.\\\",\\\"Smith:More than anything, the California vibe, the idea of it, seems to be about being multidisciplinary, being a visual artist who does music, or a musician who does visual art, the freedom of it.\\\",\\\"Gordon:See, for me that\\u2019s all New York. That comes from Warhol, the Factory. I don\\u2019t think the music here in L.A. was about being multidisciplinary.\\\",\\\"Smith:I\\u2019m thinking about someone like Joni Mitchell.\\\",\\\"Gordon:She is great, but my influences, musically and in art, are more New York, although there are some amazing things to have come out of California \\u2014 like Joan Didion. I didn\\u2019t even start reading her until a few years ago.\\\",\\\"Smith:I went to school in England, and the only book I took with me was \\u201cThe White Album,\\u201d which is, to this day, the best book about California, a kind of poem about it.\\\",\\\"Gordon: There\\u2019s the sense that you can get lost here and find your own way. New York has become such a media fish bowl and it\\u2019s so formal now, especially in the art world.\\\",\\\"Smith:You\\u2019re not as defined in L.A. So many things that I think of as \\u201cmy style\\u201d \\u2014 which is actually kind of a meaningless term \\u2014 but things that I think of as personal to me, I got from growing up here. Joan Didion, Joni Mitchell \\u2014\\\",\\\"Gordon:The Joans.\\\",\\\"Smith:Tom Jones. [Laughter] I\\u2019m obsessed with a sense of place, but it gets dissipated so quickly.\\\",\\\"Gordon:Driving down the street and looking at the contrasts in architecture, I always think of L.A. as the product of people coming to escape with their fantasies. You can have a ranch house next to a colonial house next to a weird storybook house. People customize their homes so much that it\\u2019s almost like to them it\\u2019s the ultimate freedom.\\\",\\\"Smith:You can build your dream. My partner is the ambassador to Spain and it\\u2019s interesting how an ambassador\\u2019s residence is a house divided. Upstairs is private, for our guests and us. We\\u2019ve made it super European and very traditional \\u2014 French and English and Spanish furniture. Downstairs, we\\u2019ve put in a lot of modern American art, like Rauschenberg and Philip Guston. If you\\u2019re a Spaniard coming to the downstairs you\\u2019re supposed to feel like you\\u2019re in a piece of America. Upstairs, people walk in and it feels like they\\u2019re in Spain. It\\u2019s design, or aesthetics, as performance.\\\",\\\"Gordon:To me, all design seems performative, like a film production.\\\",\\\"Smith:There\\u2019s stagecraft, to a degree. Design is about taking things that are a mess and putting them into some semblance of order. Isn\\u2019t that ultimately what any creative process is?\\\",\\\"Gordon:Well, sometimes chaos makes the art.\\\",\\\"Smith:But you\\u2019re still putting it together, right? You\\u2019re not leaving the paint on the table. You\\u2019re not leaving the chords on the page.\\\",\\\"Gordon:It\\u2019s all within some context, yeah.\\\",\\\"Smith:What I love about your stuff is that there\\u2019s this discord. There\\u2019s an immediacy and life to it, but ultimately you\\u2019re still putting things together in a way that is pleasing and completing to you. There aren\\u2019t arbitrary decisions even though they can sound like chaos.\\\",\\\"Gordon:The music part can be more chaotic. The visual part is definitely more resolved. The two rarely come together. Recently, though, I did work with the producer Justin Raisen, and we createda songthat came out of being obsessed with this style thing in L.A. \\u2014 being \\u201cmurdered out,\\u201d which is spray-painting a car matte black.\\\",\\\"Smith:You see it in the Arab world all the time, too. I went to Abu Dhabi, and it\\u2019s a chic sheikh thing to have these \\u201cmurdered-out\\u201d cars.\\\",\\\"Gordon:I see it as almost subliminal, like taking this corporate piece of machinery and making it their own, reclaiming it in a way. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have a position in the culture \\u2014 so this is my way of having a position.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Smith:What kind of song is it?\\\",\\\"Gordon:It\\u2019s pretty catchy, more commercial or accessible than some of my other stuff. What do the Obamas listen to?\\\",\\\"Smith:To be honest, I really don\\u2019t know.\\\",\\\"Gordon:I wish I\\u2019d brought a CD to give them. I remember that when Reagan was president in the \\u201980s, that\\u2019s when American hardcore really sprung up. A lot of it was political and the best of it came out of the suburbs. They called Reagan \\u201cdeath\\u201d and had lots of lyrics about him. If Trump gets elected, maybe people will start making edgier music again. And just imagine the White House. So much gold!\\\",\\\"Smith:I\\u2019m not walking into that one. Have you ever been to the White House?\\\",\\\"Gordon:I\\u2019m too impatient for tours, but I\\u2019ve stood outside. Does that count?\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 349069, \"title\": \"When Kim Gordon Met Michael Smith\"}"
