"{\"title\": \"Elizabeth Warren Pushes Dishonest 'Black Lives Matter' Narrative\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren gave a speech over the weekend that gives further mainstream Democrat legitimacy to the radical anti-law enforcement activist group Black Lives Matter.Predictably, liberal pundits ate it up. \\u201cElizabeth Warren just gave the speech that Black Lives Matter activists have been waiting for\\u201d raved the Washington Post. Prachi Gupta at Comsopolitan wrote \\u201cElizabeth Warren\\u2019s Speech in Support of Black Lives Matter Should Be Required Reading.\\u201d This is correct, although not for the reason Ms. Gupta thinks. As shown by the repeatedly debunked \\u201cClock Boy\\u201d story, 2015 has become the season of repeated falsehoods used by the left for political gain. It\\u2019s a trend that was started in force with Black Lives Matter and with Warren\\u2019s speech, we have the spectacle of a sitting United States Senator drawing high praise for repeating anti-police falsehoods. Sen. Warren pays some lip service to law enforcement:Consider law enforcement. The vast majority of police officers sign up so they can protect their communities. They are part of an honorable profession that takes risks every day to keep us safe. We know that.It\\u2019s unclear who Warren means by \\u201cwe\\u201d when she says \\u201cwe know that\\u201d law enforcement is an honorable profession, but it doesn\\u2019t seem like she\\u2019s referring the Black Lives Matter protesters who keep chanting \\u201cPigs in a blanket! Fry \\u2018em like bacon!\\u201d after the murders of police officers.Immediately, though, Warren drinks deep at the well of deception perpetrated by Black Lives Matter:But we also know \\u2013 and say \\u2013 the names of those whose lives have been treated with callous indifference. Sandra Bland. Freddie Gray. Michael Brown.The Bland, Brown, and Gray cases have been shown to be riddled with falsehoods and outright fabrications but have pushed by Black Lives Matter over and over. Warren wastes no time in doubling down on the lies in her speech.Listen to the brave, powerful voices of today\\u2019s new generation of civil rights leaders. Incredible voices. Listen to them say: \\u201cIf I die in police custody, know that I did not commit suicide.\\u201d Watch them march through the streets, \\u201chands up don\\u2019t shoot\\u201d \\u2013 not to incite a riot, but to fight for their lives.Even the Washington Post is forced to acknowledge this, although in backhanded way. WaPo reporter Wesley Lowery writes:At times, Warren\\u2019s\\u00a0speech read as if\\u00a0it could have been authored by the activists themselves \\u2014 unyielding in its criticism of police violence and even invoking the phrase \\u201chands up, don\\u2019t shoot,\\u201d a Ferguson rallying cry that conservatives have attacked as a lie because the Justice Department concluded that Michael Brown\\u2019s hands were most likely not up in the air when he was shot and killed by Darren Wilson.Lowery\\u2019s trick there is to try to play it as though the fact that \\u201chands up, don\\u2019t shoot\\u201d was a lie is merely a conservative talking point, while still acknowledging that Eric Holder\\u2019s Department of Justice came to the same conclusion. It\\u2019s an impressive feat of journalistic gymnastics.Here\\u2019s the speech in its entirety:\", \"article_id\": 169208}"
