Trump\\u2019s favorite ways to deal with a difficult question:\\\",\\\"Asked what he would do on issues like trade deals or terrorism, he warns that bad things are happening \\u201call over the place.\\u201d His policies as president might or might not include the subject at hand \\u201cand a lot of different things.\\u201d All ethnic groups will \\u201clove\\u201d a Trump presidency.\\\",\\\"Here is what you may almost never hear Mr. Trump say: \\u201cI\\u2019m not familiar with that,\\u201d or \\u201cI misspoke.\\u201d\\\",\\\"No one ever expected Mr. Trump to turn himself into the issues expert of the Republican presidential field. Yet the verbal shortcuts and salesmanlike stretches that he has relied on for months \\u2014 generalities used to dodge questions, and questionable recollections \\u2014 are tripping him up as the tenor of the campaign has grown more serious.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump\\u2019s avoidance of specifics is seen by some of his admirers as a refreshing contrast to musty politicians who play by the rules. And he has a knack for muddying the waters with catchall phrases that allow his supporters and detractors to read whatever they want into his statements.\\\",\\\"But his refusal to be pinned down on the details of his positions has repeatedly prompted reporters and interviewers to engage in a guessing game as to what he means. And he tends to choose all of the above.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTrump has an amazing ability to backtrack without incurring any political harm from doing so,\\u201d said Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review. \\u201cHis supporters don\\u2019t seem to care very much about consistency from one interview or statement to the next, as long as he\\u2019s always projecting strength.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Jeff Shesol, a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, pointed to what he called Mr. Trump\\u2019s \\u201cunshakable sense of self-confidence,\\u201d adding: \\u201cHe\\u2019s asking you to just trust him with that.\\u201d\\\",\\\"When Mr. Trumptold a Yahoo News reporteron Thursday that steps would have to be taken to monitor American Muslims \\u201cthat were frankly unthinkable a year ago,\\u201d the reporter asked if that might include registering Muslims in a database or requiring them to carry a special form of identification. Mr. Trump did not rule out either. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"And on Sunday, when ABC\\u2019s George Stephanopoulos tried to flesh out what Mr. Trump had meant by \\u201cunthinkable\\u201d policies, he asked Mr. Trump if waterboarding was one of them. It took two tries before he gave a direct answer. \\u201cI would bring it back, yes,\\u201dMr. Trump said.\\\",\\\"Even when he reverses course, he often manages to do it in such a way that his supporters rally behind him.\\\",\\\"When Joe Scarborough of MSNBC, three days after the terroristattacks in Paris, asked Mr. Trump if he would consider closing mosques, Mr. Trump seemed to treat it quite seriously. \\u201cI would hate to do it, but it would be something that you\\u2019re going to have to strongly consider,\\u201dhe said.\\\",\\\"In the next breath, though, Mr. Trump seemed to click undo: \\u201cIt\\u2019s something that many people \\u2014 not me, but many people \\u2014 are considering and many people are going to do,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Not all the land mines Mr. Trump has stepped on lately were placed by journalists.\\\",\\\"At a rally in Alabama on Saturday,Mr. Trump claimedthat he \\u201cwatched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering\\u201d as the World Trade Center fell on Sept. 11, 2001. He repeated the claim to Mr. Stephanopoulos on Sunday. But it was false, as fact-checkers atThe New York Timesandotherorganizationshave since reported.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump did not budge, however. Instead, he pointed on Monday to a2001 Washington Post articlethat said \\u201ca number of people\\u201d in Jersey City were detained and questioned for \\u201callegedly\\u201d celebrating on their rooftops.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI want an apology! Many people have tweeted that I am right!\\u201d he wrote on Twitter. (On Monday evening, the NBC reporter Katy Tur said Mr. Trump had called her to say he has \\u201cthe world\\u2019s best memory.\\u201d)\\\",\\\"Terrorism has not been the only trouble spot in recent days. On Monday night, in an interview with Mr. Trump, the Fox News host Bill O\\u2019Reilly chastised him for aTwitter message that contained false statisticsclaiming that black-on-white murders are much higher than they are.\\\",\\\"\\u201cDon\\u2019t put your name on stuff like this,\\u201d Mr. O\\u2019Reilly said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t tweet; I retweeted somebody that supposedly was an expert,\\u201d Mr. Trump said.\\\",\\\"Through it all, Mr. Trump has never apologized or acknowledged a mistake. Someone else is almost always to blame; in the case of the Muslim registry flap, Mr. Trump faulted the reporter who first asked him about the idea. And Mr. Trump\\u2019s supporters seem content to take his word for it.\\\",\\\"A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump declined to comment for this article.\\\",\\\"Politicians are not known for adhering to the facts with laser precision at all times. But Mr. Trump has shown that this year, voters care less than they ever did.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe electorate, at least the Republican electorate, is a little skeptical of specificity this year,\\u201d said Matt Latimer, a speechwriter for President George W. Bush and a partner in the Washington communications firm Javelin. Voters are weary of unfulfilled promises from politicians, he said. \\u201cWhat they\\u2019re looking for is attitude and tone.\\u201d\\\",\\\"There is a distant echo of Barry Goldwater, whose 1964 presidential campaign helped bring about the conservative revolution in theRepublican Party. Mr. Trump\\u2019s supporters often say he gives voice to things that no one else will say; Goldwater\\u2019s slogan in 1964 was \\u201cIn your heart, you know he\\u2019s right.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Yet Goldwater had been elected to office before, despite views that were seen as radical at the time.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis is Trump\\u2019s first go, and he seems \\u2014 judging by the polls, he\\u2019s succeeding on his own terms,\\u201d Mr. Shesol said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s sort of maddening and mystifying to the rest of us.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
