Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) was one of the few Republicans to publicly criticize Penny Pritzker, President Obama's pick for Commerce Secretary, over her family's business investments -- including offshore investments. His statement, which came after when her nomination was announced Thursday:\\u201cEvery nominee's offshore tax avoidance activities should be examined as part of the nomination process.\\u00a0 If the Commerce Committee doesn't\\u2019t explore these questions with the nominee, I plan to do so, but I hope the committee will give the tax history a serious look.\\u00a0 This is the second nominee in a row, Jack Lew being the first, who\\u2019s associated with the kind of tax avoidance activity that the President dismisses as fat cat shenanigans for others.\\u00a0 It\\u2019s hypocritical to overlook tax avoidance when it\\u2019s convenient.\\u201dA Pritzker ally points out that Grassley was considerably less perturbed seven years ago when fellow Republican George W. Bush nominated Hank Paulson for Treasury. Paulson, the former head of Goldman Sachs, had invested in several funds run out of the tax-sheltered Caymans.Grassley, according to press accounts at the time, was unmoved by suggestions those investments would compromise Paulson's integrity. The AP, June 6, 2006:\\u201cHenry Paulson Jr. met Monday with the head of the Senate Finance Committee, who predicted that President Bush's selection as Treasury secretary could be confirmed and on the job by early July. Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said he... believed the nomination could win Senate approval before Congress leaves for the July 4 break. Grassley praised Paulson, chief executive of the Wall Street investment firm Goldman Sachs, for the \\u2018vast amount of experience\\u2019 he will bring to the job.\\u201dThere is a certain apples-to-sugarcane aspect to the Pritzker-Paulson comparison: In the case of Paulson (and current Treasury Secretary Jack Lew) the amounts invested were only a fraction of their overall portfolios.(Also on POLITICO: Obama's week of poke-in-the-eye picks)Pritzker's family has sent far larger amounts offshore; It was a pillar of the family's immensely profitable investment strategy.But Pritzker herself had little to do with any of those decisions. She was four when her grandfather decided to pour millions into offshore, tax-sheltered trusts, according to this eye-opening 2003 Forbes expose.A call to a Grassley spokesman wasn't immediately returned.Glenn Thrush is senior staff writer at Politico Magazine.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
