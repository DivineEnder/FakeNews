"{\"title\": \"America Is a Bulwark For Civilization In the World\", \"content\": \"I once had a conversation with a prominent and influential New Left-era individual about what the possible roots of our vast ideological differences between the two of us. I reasoned that my conservatism is more then anything else a product of my patriotism, especially after 9/11 \\u2013 which in turn leads to my rejection of (and often anger at) New Leftism and it\\u2019s contempt for patriotism and America\\u2019s interests, which I find to be insulting. He took this into account and explained that in their view \\u201cAmerica is flawed just as any other nation is, and the less powerful it is the less damage it could do to the rest of the world\\u201d.\\n\\nBut isn\\u2019t that view contradictory toward it\\u2019s stated ends? Look at what happened to the world when American interests withdrew from it in the late 1970s. Are the of Iran better off now then they were under the Shah? Are the people of southern Vietnam and better off then they were when they were people of South Vietnam? And today, are the people of Gaza better off then they were under the Israelis?Now that I finally got around to reading that much talked about article Norman Podhoretz wrote for the Wall Street Journal, some of this makes more sense.\\n\\nBut whereas the communists had in their delusional vision of the Soviet Union a model of the kind of society that would replace the one they were bent on destroying, the new leftists only knew what they were against: America, or Amerika as they spelled it to suggest its kinship to Nazi Germany. Thanks, however, to the unmasking of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian nightmare, they did not know what they were for.Exactly right! That is why they only PRETEND to care about people in Cuba, or Venezuela, or Iraq, or the Palestinian territories. That is how a supposed peace group sends money to Al Qaeda in Iraq. That is how a Human Rights group could have a supporter of Saddam Hussein and the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre as it\\u2019s Middle East chief. That is how Arafat could win the Nobel Peace Prize.Podhoretz goes on to discuss how the New Left \\u201chad pulled off the incredible feat of taking over the Democratic Party behind the presidential candidacy of George McGovern in 1972\\u201d, and\\n\\nNobody nobody tells this story like David Horowitz.
