"{\"article_id\": 195588, \"content\": \"NBC News spoke with several senior US intelligence officials, who declined to say where or how they received word of the potential threat but said the intelligence gathering was recent. The officials said the information further incentivized the US to locate Boko Haram\\u2019s \\u201cmilitary assets\\u201d and figure out its senior command structure. The officials felt that one of the keys to bringing down the Islamist group is to acquire better knowledge about its leadership structure.The intelligence officials said Boko Haram has decided to target US interests because of Washington\\u2019s involvement in trying to find the 276 missing Nigerian schoolgirls, abducted last month by the militant Islamist group.Boko Haram\\u2019s intention to attack US interests is nothing new, according to a senior US counterterror official NBC News consulted. He said, \\u201cBoko Haram has a long standing interest in this\\u2026 It\\u2019s consistent with what we\\u2019ve seen from them. Broadly speaking, its in line with what we are tracking.\\u201d Another intel official agreed with the aforementioned assessment. He noted that Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has \\u201clong aspired his followers to carry out\\u201d attacks on US interests. Last year, the United States offered a seven million dollar reward for information on the whereabouts of Shekau.In April, Boko Haram leader Shekau released a video in which he stated, \\u201cLet the world know that we have been enjoined by Allah to kill the unbelievers. We shall continue to kill those who strive to stand against the will of Allah by opposing shari\\u2019a. We don\\u2019t mind if we die doing this because it is even a blessing for us to die in this cause and gain paradise.\\u201dLast week, Shekau\\u2019s rhetoric focused on mocking the United States along with the international community for failing to retrieve the abducted schoolgirls. The Boko Haram leader said in a 56-minute video, \\u201cWe are stronger than America anywhere they are. If you want to defend, do so because I am ready. Where do you say you will come and look for me? Do you know where I am since all these days? You are just searching in vain by looking at every nook and cranny. I don\\u2019t have a land; anywhere I find myself is my land because all land belongs to God.\\u201d The jihadist leader continued, \\u201cAny amount let them spend; we will bring this country down. We are stronger than America anywhere they are. We will open a killing pool for all those who have insulted us like George Bush, Obama, and even [Goodluck] Jonathan.\\u201d\", \"title\": \"Intel Suggests Boko Haram Planning Attack on US Interests in Nigeria\", \"source_id\": 2}"
