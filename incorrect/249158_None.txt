It is, for lack of a better phrase, a fishing expedition whereby the Obama administration hopes to find guns they did not know existed and create a record\\u2013including location and ownership information\\u2013for those guns going forward.Breitbart News reported on June 1, 2015:Rule\\u00a0RIN: 1140-AA43\\u00a0[of the \\u201cUnified Agenda\\u201d] impacts trusts that hold firearms regulated under the National Firearms Act. The rule requires trusts, corporations or legal entities possessing the guns to produce a \\u201cresponsible person\\u201d who can undergo a background for guns in probate,\\u00a0before they are passed to a descendant. This person would \\u201ccomplete a specified form\\u201d and \\u201csubmit photographs and fingerprints\\u201d simply to hold the guns while the estate is settled.The DOJ throws a bone to trusts by allowing the transfer to descendant to occur thereafter on a \\u201ctax-exempt status,\\u201d but that all happens after the government has been able to extend the paper trail for firearms transactions and owners just a bit further.According to the White House executive order preview, this extension of background checks to family and corporate-held trusts is now under the auspices of Obama\\u2019s executive orders.Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
