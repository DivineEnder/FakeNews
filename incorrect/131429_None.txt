"{\"title\": \"Despite 11-13 Record, Sale Battles Scherzer for Top AL Pitcher\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"In 20 percent of the 4,500 starts in the Value Add database, the team gives their starting pitcher no chance to win \\u2013 a 0.00 ERA Needed to win based on the number of runs they score minus the number of unearned and relief runs they allow.\\nThe Tigers have only failed to give Scherzer a chance to win in three of 31 starts, while this weekend marks the third time in the last four starts that Sale has been given no chance to win. Sale now has 221 strikeouts, the White Sox record for a left-hander, and just a few shy of Scherzer. Value Add gives Sale a very slight edge for the season, though Scherzer will very likely win the Cy Young easily.As always, make sure to follow our team on Twitter for breaking news and thoughts.
