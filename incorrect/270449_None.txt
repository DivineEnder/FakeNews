"{\"title\": \"Getting Priorities Straight: With Country Collapsing Economically, The Oklahoman Worries about... Self-Financed Political Races by Republicans\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Home foreclosures are up, unemployment is up, food stamp usage is up, and bankruptcy filings \\u2013 well, they\\u2019re up, too.So what does The Oklahoman, the Sooner State\\u2019s largest daily newspaper (which recently had to lay off nearly sixty employees) choose to fixate upon: \\u201cSelf-funded political races often turn out poorly.\\u201dNo kidding \\u2013 as do races that PACs and lobbyists heavily finance.In a house editorial, brimming with a grumpy attitude, The Oklahoman scornfully wrote that self-funding is all the rage, with candidates loaning their campaigns their own bucks to \\u201cjump start\\u201d the process, and that the end goal of such investments is winning (duh!) coupled with the hope that donors will \\u201ccover the loans.\\u201dThe paper especially singled out Grand Old Party members who are running for statewide office in Oklahoma and are heavy donors to their own campaigns, namely Mark Costello (commissioner for labor candidate who is a businessman) and Dr. Janet Barresi (state superintendent of public instruction candidate who is a dentist).Wrote some hack at The Oklahoman:\\n\\nMoney well invested, when you consider the results.Not only did Barresi and Costello handily win their recent primaries, they stand an excellent chance of winning their respective offices in November.     To boot, they are eager to streamline government and are quintessential, accomplished Middle Americans who have connected with much-burdened taxpayers. That they are willing to not pester voters with endless pleas for money \\u2013 especially during a down time in the economy \\u2013 would be grounds to give these candidates props, as they freely exercise their First Amendment right to speech, or, at the least, give them a chance to explain their rationale for the self-funding.But, noooo. The paper, once complimented as the worst in the country by the Columbia Journalism Review, is now more enthused with promoting corporate welfare schemes than championing genuine conservative principles.The editorial closed ominously, noting that an overwhelming number of congressional candidates, who, in 2008, loaned their campaigns hundreds of thousands of dollars, lost in their bids for public office.Mark Costello penned a response to the newspaper; here\\u2019s part of what he had to say about his private-sector-funded political effort:\\n\\nIf George Soros passionately spends umpteen dollars to bolster liberalism and influence public attitudes for evil, then why on earth should we (and The Oklahoman!) not be thrilled when an honorable man or woman does the same?Oh, right \\u2014 he\\u2019s a Republican.\", \"article_id\": 270449}"
