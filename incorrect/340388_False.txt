"{\"title\": \"Spike in Donor Numbers for Clinton Foundation\", \"content\": \"{\\\"The Clinton Foundation accelerated its fund-raising in the first six months of the year, officials said Thursday, asHillary Rodham Clintonwas gearing up for her presidential run amid a crush of news reports scrutinizing the charity\\u2019s solicitation of foreign donors.\\\",\\\"Foundation officials said there were 10,516 donors so far this year, compared with 8,801 during the same six-month period last year.\\\",\\\"TheBill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundationdid not release the precise amounts any donor gave or the total raised. Rather, it posted on its website a newly updated cumulative list of contributors, most of them dating to 2001. The amounts are listed in ranges; the highest tier is $25 million and up.\\\",\\\"Among the names that surfaced as donors for the first time was that of the golfer Tiger Woods, who was listed as having given $25,001 to $50,000.\\\",\\\"As Mrs. Clinton, in the early days of her campaign, called for prosecuting executives and companies for Wall Street crimes, the financial services industry continued to support the Clinton Foundation. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and J. P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. \\u2014 all of which had given before, either directly or through their own foundations \\u2014 made new contributions.\\\",\\\"The Clintons themselves crossed a new financial threshold, arriving in the $5 million to $10 million donor bracket. That may reflect their enhanced wherewithal: The former president and the former secretary of state recently disclosed that their earnings from January 2014 through mid-May of this year had exceeded $30 million, much of that from speaking fees.\\\",\\\"They did not write personal checks, however: The money was transferred from a smaller charity, the Clinton Family Foundation, to the larger entity.\\\",\\\"There were also donations from at least four Moroccan entities, including a mining company and a bank, during the first half of the year. One of them, OCP Corporation, a phosphate mining company that had donated to the foundation in the past, rose into the $5 million to $10 million category during the period.Politico reported in Aprilthat OCP had planned to give the Clinton Foundation a major gift to hold a conference in Marrakesh. The meeting took place in May with former PresidentBill Clintonon hand.\\\",\\\"Those who gave from January through June included plenty of previous donors and familiar names, among them many who have supported the Clintons in other areas, including Haim Saban, who (with his wife and foundation) has given $10 million to $25 million to the foundation, along with $2 million to a \\u201csuper PAC\\u201d supporting Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign, and J. B. Pritzker, a Chicago philanthropist who was a national co-chairman of Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s 2008 campaign, who gave through his family foundation.\\\",\\\"Some of the foundation\\u2019s most generous donors also made additional gifts, including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Canadian billionaire Frank Giustra and Nationale Postcode Loterij, a Dutch lottery. Each was listed at $25 million and up.\\\",\\\"Officials of the foundation, after years of it generally being treated as an apolitical entity, spent several months swatting back questions about large donations from Middle Eastern countries known for violence against women \\u2014 at a time when Mrs. Clinton was making her advocacy on behalf of women a major part of her campaign.\\\",\\\"Mr. Clinton has defended the fund-raising efforts, arguing that the foundation\\u2019s good works justify the acceptance of money from all sorts of donors.\\\",\\\"He raised money aggressively to try to amass a $250 million endowment before Mrs. Clinton began her campaign. But Mr. Clinton\\u2019s aides have said he has now set a fund-raising target of twice that.\\\",\\\"The foundation has also faced recent questions about donations from companies and countries that had business before the United States government while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state during President Obama\\u2019s first term.\\\",\\\"Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign realized early on that voters did not know the scope of the Clinton Foundation\\u2019s work, giving an opening to Republicans who want to portray it as a way for political donors to curry favor and access.\\\",\\\"On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton, who joined the foundation shortly after leaving the State Department at the beginning of 2013, has repeatedly said she is proud of the foundation\\u2019s work. Surrogates have received talking points to remind voters that the foundation has helped fight AIDS in Africa and rebuild Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, among other endeavors.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 340388}"
