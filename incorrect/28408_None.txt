As Gov. Chris Christie walked out on stage, moderators David Muir and Martha Raddatz called out Dr. Ben Carson. A camera backstage showed Carson starting to walk out, but he stopped himself once he heard the moderators announce the next candidate, Ted Cruz.Cruz walked out, and Carson stayed put as a stage manager tried to wave Carson on stage. He didn't move. Donald Trump then walked up next to Carson as his name was called, but also stopped next to Carson.Marco Rubio was called up next, walking past both Trump and Carson onto the stage, as did Jeb Bush. John Kasich initially didn't make it out onto the stage at all.The moderators thought they were done. \\\"Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates.\\\"But they weren't. \\\"Dr. Ben Carson, please come out on the stage. He's standing there, as well.
