The Obama administration ripped into the Supreme Court for ruling under the First Amendment that corporations \\u2013 voluntary associations of people \\u2013 could spend money on elections. To pretend that this administration is in any way interested in an \\u201cunfettered\\u201d First Amendment is ludicrous.
