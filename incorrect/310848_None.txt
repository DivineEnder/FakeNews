"{\"title\": \"INTERVIEW: Lucian Wintrich, The Man Behind The First Pro-Trump Art Show\", \"content\": \"Wintrich, a gay conservative photographer who already caused ripples of controversy with his \\u201cTwinks for Trump\\u201d photoseries, sent shockwaves through the largely left-leaning art world with his proposed art show. He was thrown out of his first venue and faced legal threats over his proposed exhibit.Shortly before\\u00a0the groundbreaking show got underway, he sat down for a phone interview with Breitbart Tech\\u2019s\\u00a0Allum Bokhari about the event,\\u00a0the controversy surrounding it, and the thoughts of the man behind it all.Allum Bokhari: When\\u2019s the last time that this has happened, that someone was barred from a gallery for the politics of their exhibit?Lucian Wintrich: I believe it was Mapplethorpe and it was the conservative Christians and evangelicals (who were protesting). It is an example that the left is just as if not more reactionary.A: Do you think the scales have tipped then, that it\\u2019s now the left who are the new \\u201cMoral Majority?\\u201dL: I think that the scales have more than tipped. You look at the left right now saying \\u201cyeah we\\u2019re gonna beat the shit out of you, watch your back.\\u201d When the Christians were protesting that, they weren\\u2019t necessarily inciting violence; they were saying \\u201cyeah we\\u2019re not gonna touch you but you\\u2019ll burn in hell later on.\\u201d So I think I\\u2019d prefer that threat. I have been a little bit freaked out (by the leftist protesters) but at the same time, these people are so used to that method of intimidation and coercion that it\\u2019s sort of worn thin I think.A: So tell me about yourself. How does a gay photographer who works for media companies in New York become a Trump supporter?L: Well I absolutely despise Clinton and I think Trump is a brilliant representation and embodiment of how we can help turn around what I feel to be a terrible direction that this country is currently headed in. Clinton\\u2019s so untrustworthy and such a panderer that she will find the lowest common denominator, regressive emotion which stifles culture, stifles art. It holds us back and it puts us in a place that Germany knew very very well until cultural notions sort of took hold there. And now they\\u2019re sort of crashing and burning and I think that will very soon be seen in their economyA: Are you referring to Germany\\u2019s immigration problem?L: Yes, yes, mostly I think it\\u2019s a combination of their immigration and they have the same sort of regressive oversensitivity where \\u201cmy god we can\\u2019t really say anything, we need to respect every single thing that we\\u2019re told to respect\\u201d and it\\u2019s tip toeing. When did Western culture become so scared of Western culture? It\\u2019s unfortunate and I think Trump is helping to change that. Even this nonsense that came out where he was accidentally recorded or left the lavalier on his jacket on. The people that are saying \\u201cthis is outrageous, this is disgusting,\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if they have friends and I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019ve ever just sat down at a bar for an hour. I mean that is typically how a lot of Americans talk and I feel like fifty years ago it would have been laughed off. There\\u2019s also this thing going on right now in the world where almost everything is recorded and everything is documented and filmed and photographed. Either we have future politicians in one of those Plato\\u2019s republic type of scenarios where they\\u2019re not exposed to any elements of the more crass elements of American culture and then we throw them into the American eye after they\\u2019ve lived this sheltered closed life\\u2026A: Isn\\u2019t that what Clinton is to some extent? She\\u2019s been in politics for more than half her life.L: Oh she really is and she\\u2019s bringing back a bunch of cronies who are part of that world where their actual only job is to maintain power. They were raised and they were continuously told all they had to do was maintain power at any cost. Trump not so much. I mean he definitely has a sense of capitalism and business power, the whole point of business is to advance but it\\u2019s completely different to the coercive power of politics. Which is why I\\u2019m more of Goldwater conservative. Some of Trump\\u2019s policies I think might be as wonderful as those of Goldwater and he does still embody a large portion of the conservative spirit and conservative ideology. People say \\u201cwell Hillary Clinton is more conservative than some Republicans\\u201d and yeah, but the parts of her that are conservative are the worst parts of the platform. And what Trump has absorbed from the conservative party and the American populace in forming his policies I think is vastly more reflective of the climate we\\u2019re in right now and what we need to advance as a country.A: Why did you choose the artists that you chose?L: Over the course of the last month or so a bunch of my pieces were sort of propagating online, a lot of other conservatives, about 50 conservative artists reached out to me. Some of them were terrible, as is to be expected, and some of them were fantastic. And I think what I really was going for in the final selection of artist was diversity of ideologies within the party, different worldviews, and as many mediums as possible, so we don\\u2019t really have too many of the same form of art. Obviously with Milo, he gave a drag performance in front of 2500 young Republicans at LSU, so that is like a form of educational performance art. I think Milo\\u2019s talk is absolutely brilliant art and I don\\u2019t think a lot of people recognise that. I\\u2019m especially excited about Milo\\u2019s piece. \\u00a0A lot of people on the left expect to hate him. They have no idea what he\\u2019s actually doing, what he\\u2019s saying and what the actual cultural benefit is of what he\\u2019s achieving right now. He\\u2019s a brilliant conservative mind and he\\u2019s absolutely an artist and so with this show, we\\u2019re putting it in New York which is the heart of the art world. So we\\u2019re taking an artist to a place where many people don\\u2019t know that his character is a large part of his art and we\\u2019re bringing him into that world. So it\\u2019ll be interesting to see how people react to that and if they sort of, I dunno, everythings open to interpretation.A: There was talk of potential protests by activists ahead of the event. Do you envision any trouble?L: I think literally anything could happen. I think that the protesters might just be pussies because of the rain, maybe they won\\u2019t show up. I haven\\u2019t heard anything leaked through the grapevine, I tend to think liberals are generally stupid but maybe they got smarter and figured out a better way to execute this. But really anything could happen, very luckily we do have four navy seals working security, we have the new york fire department, so I don\\u2019t think they can slip in necessarily. This is a fairly controversial show so I don\\u2019t know. If the birdman can break out of Alcatraz then I wouldn\\u2019t be surprised if one liberal was able to slip through the doors.A: People talk about the enthusiasm gap, and\\u00a0I don\\u2019t see many art shows being planned for Hillary. A lot of people are voting for her because they hate Trump or they just don\\u2019t want the Republicans to win, but they don\\u2019t seem very enthusiastic about her. Do you think this art show is another example of this gap? I mean, I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019d be an art show for Jeb Bush either\\u2026L: I do think that there\\u2019s far more young people excited for Trump than there are excited for Hillary and that\\u2019s sort of everything. If you read all the arguments for supporting Hillary they\\u2019re just \\u201coh well she\\u2019s better than Trump.\\u201d And that sort of notion or idea that \\u201coh ok well I guess mom if we\\u2019re having Tofu for dinner it\\u2019s better than nothing,\\u201d that\\u2019s not really going to elicit the same sort of excitement and an expression in the art as a candidate like Trump. And I think inherently he lends himself to art. He\\u2019s a celebrity and before this election he was a very loved figure by everybody, left or right in New York and he\\u2019s a pop culture icon. So we\\u2019re just sort of translating that to a variety of mediums.A: Final question:\\u00a0you mentioned Germany and western culture earlier, do you think artists these days, especially left leaning ones, tend to not be so keen on western culture, would you like to see more artists celebrate western culture instead of denigrate itL: Oh absolutely! Absolutely! If not for western culture they wouldn\\u2019t have the ability to express themselves, the enlightenment in the arts and literature and everything else, it\\u2019s a byproduct of western culture. It\\u2019s unfortunate and I do think that a lot of artists are very politically stupid and I know plenty of truly incredible artists in New York who are brilliant painters and brilliant photographers and they\\u2019re so blind and led by leftists because that\\u2019s the culture that they know. I think they have a wonderful sort of technical skill but no real understanding of what they\\u2019re talking about politically.You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.\\u00a0Email tips and suggestions to abokhari@breitbart.com.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 310848}"
