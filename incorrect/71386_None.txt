"{\"title\": \"JFK\\u2019s press secretary issues  false cover story: Oct. 20, 1962\", \"content\": \"On this day in 1962, President John F. Kennedy's press secretary, Pierre Salinger, told reporters that JFK had flown back to Washington because he had a cold. In reality, Kennedy returned to secretly confer with his top advisers at the White House over what soon came to be known as the Cuban missile crisis.Kennedy was in Seattle to attend the Century 21 World's Fair when Salinger announced the president had contracted an \\\"upper respiratory infection\\\" that required him to return to the White House and go to bed.The seeds of the confrontation were sown on Oct. 14, when reconnaissance photographs taken by an American U-2 spy plane revealed missile bases that were under construction in Cuba. On Oct. 16, Kennedy pored over photos of the 40 ballistic missile sites \\u2014 some equipped with SS-4 missiles that were within easy striking distance of the southeastern United States.In response to the Soviet actions, Kennedy and his advisers concluded the administration had three options: to try to persuade Moscow to remove the missiles by diplomatic means, to bomb the missile sites (which, it was later revealed, would have also led to the deaths of many Soviet military personnel), or to implement a naval blockade of the island. Kennedy chose to blockade Cuba, technically \\u2014 in and of itself an act of war \\u2014 while retaining the option of an air attack if the blockade failed to produce the intended result.On the evening of Oct. 22, Kennedy went on national television to alert the nation to the situation and to call on Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to remove the missiles or face U.S. retaliation. Moscow initially responded by sending more ships \\u2014 possibly carrying military cargo \\u2014 toward Cuba while construction at the missile sites continued. Over the next week, the crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war while the two sides exchanged frosty diplomatic cables.By Oct. 28, Kennedy and Khrushchev had reached a settlement: The Cuban missile sites would be dismantled. In return, the United States \\\"voluntarily\\\" agreed to remove its aging Jupiter medium-range missiles from the Turkish-Soviet border while also promising never to invade Cuba.The Cold War antagonists had faced the terrible reality of a nuclear war and stepped back from the brink. Still, the crisis prompted the Soviets to markedly increase their arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the U.S. from Soviet territory.SOURCE: WWW.HISTORY.COM\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 71386}"
