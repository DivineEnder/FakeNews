Then he had to go to the Waldorf Astoria.\\\",\\\"Hours after canceling what had been a heavily publicized forum for presidential candidates, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who has cultivated a down-to-earth image, found himself at the annual Al Smith charity dinner, wearing white tie, sitting inches away from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and listening to a crowd of wealthy attendees laugh as his predecessor,Michael R. Bloomberg, cracked jokes at his expense.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSeriously, it\\u2019s great to see Mayor de Blasio actually in New York City tonight,\\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \\u201cTo get him to show up, his staff told him that the dinner was in Iowa.\\u201d\\\",Ouch.,\\\"Still, Mr. de Blasio, despite a cool reception from the $2,500-a-plate audience, took the zingers in stride, laughing and gamely shaking hands with Mr. Cuomo, his fellow Democrat and frequent foil. And the mayor was by no means the only target at the 70th edition of the dinner, a required stop for leading politicians that has the feel of a Friar\\u2019s Club roast in formal attire.\\\",\\\"Alfred E. Smith IV, the M.C. for the evening and great-grandson of the New York governor for whom the event is named, took aim at Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, noting that the two struggling Republican presidential candidates were Catholics. \\u201cAt this point,\\u201d Mr. Smith said, \\u201cthey would take salvation anywhere they can get it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cDonald Trump is devout,\\u201d Mr. Smith added of another Republican presidential hopeful. \\u201cHe worships Donald Trump.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Bloomberg, the evening\\u2019s featured speaker, noted that Mr. Trump had claimed to have a net worth of $10 billion. \\u201cSome experts say, \\u2018No way.\\u2019 Me? Been there, done that,\\u201d said the former mayor, whose net worth is estimated at three times that amount.\\\",\\\"Mr. Bloomberg drew his loudest applause when he joked that \\u201csitting between the governor and mayor for the next two hours might feel like 40 years of marriage.\\u201d He called the two men \\u201can incredibly close couple \\u2014 like Cain and Abel, Hamilton and Burr, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Smith had his own jabs for the local dignitaries. He said that Mr. Cuomo had shown up \\u201cbecause we told him Bill de Blasio would not be here,\\u201d and added that the perennially tardy mayor had only come by \\u201cbecause we told him the dinner started at noon.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe only place the mayor showed up early was the Brooklyn real estate market,\\u201d Mr. Smith added, as Mr. de Blasio clapped his hands.\\\",\\\"Mr. Cuomo seemed to particularly enjoy a line about Pope Francis delivered by Mr. Bloomberg, who said the pontiff had planned \\u201cto meet with a group of hardened criminals while he was in New York, but the State Legislature wasn\\u2019t in session.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Guests at the dinner, which organizers said raised more than $2.6 million for charity, dined on delicately composed lobster salad and a beef entree paired with a sweet onion souffl\\u00e9. Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s introduction earned a smattering of applause and a single loud jeer. Mr. Bloomberg enjoyed a warmer response, with the audience cheering his jokes about running for president.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019ve always said that the country is not ready for a divorced, Jewish billionaire from New York City,\\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \\u201cBut after watching a divorced, Christian billionaire from New York City shoot to the top of the polls, I\\u2019ve decided to reconsider.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Although Mr. de Blasio did not appear to have many friends in the room, one fan did ask him to pose for a picture: John Catsimatidis, the real estate and grocery magnate, who grabbed a camera and photographed the mayor standing beside Mr. Catsimatidis\\u2019s wife, Margo.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019ve known him for 25 years and I like him as a person,\\u201d Mr. Catsimatidis, who interviewed the mayor on his radio program recently, said before the event began. Asked about Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s decision to cancel the forum for Iowa, Mr. Catsimatidis shrugged.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think he has national ambitions someday,\\u201d he said, adding that the mayor should have gone anyway. \\u201cA few days on the weekend won\\u2019t hurt.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
