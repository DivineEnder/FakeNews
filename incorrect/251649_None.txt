He claims today\\u2019s teens need to see the film, which follows five actual cases of bullying. It\\u2019s a teachable moment, the producer argues, and an important documentary kids shouldn\\u2019t be deprived of due to its restricted rating.Weinstein\\u2019s campaign has recently been joined by Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp, Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga. When Weinstein speaks, people act.But let\\u2019s call this what it is \\u2013 a marketing campaign, not a human rights initiative.The Motion Picture Association of America, which determines movie ratings, will open itself up to constant second guessing and bloviating from worried filmmakers if it bends for \\u201cjust this one instance.\\u201d R-rated film often make less than their PG and PG:13 peers thanks to a smaller potential audience.And, much more importantly, \\u201cBully\\u201d could be bleeped in a few key spots to reduce its current rating without losing the alleged power of the message.This isn\\u2019t about ratings. It\\u2019s a publicity campaign being orchestrated by a master. And Weinstein\\u2019s celebrity pals are playing right along.The film could easily be released on home video in its R-rated version. That\\u2019s the format that will last far longer than what\\u2019s seen on the screen for a few weeks this year. The bullying issue isn\\u2019t going away, so the form that matters most is the one teens will have access to once the film shifts to its post-theatrical release plans.Bravo to Weinstein for playing the industry like a Stradivarius. Let\\u2019s hope the MPAA can tune out Weinstein\\u2019s bullying tactics.\", \"title\": \"Weinstein Uses 'Bully' Tactics on Ratings Board\", \"source_id\": 2}"
