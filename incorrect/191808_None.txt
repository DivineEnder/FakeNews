"{\"article_id\": 191808, \"title\": \"Lonewolf Diaries: The Case Against Canada & Hate Crime Laws\", \"content\": \"Canada, it is a silly place. Yes, I was raised there, and yes I acknowledge it. Sadly, in recent years it seems that Canada has gone from silly to downright dangerous. This is particularly true if you are a Conservative or dare to ever even think of speaking out against the politically correct, sub-zero establishment.\\n\\n\\nYou\\u2019ve no doubt heard about Ann Coulters\\u2019 escapades in the Great White North. College leftists (who\\u2019d had no qualms with terrorist sympathizers speaking at their school in the past) were so offended with the idea of what Madam Coulter might say ,that they attempted to ban her from the premises. When that didn\\u2019t happen, the young Green-Day liberals decided to stage a protest. Of course (as is often the case with liberal protests) things got out of hand, with protesters becoming so unruly that the situation had become not only a safety hazard to Ann herself, but for the myriad people who were there to hear her speak. Woodstockers would be proud! So students thirsty for knowledge and debate have to deal with all of this hooplah because many Canadians forecasted that Ann Coulter might engage in -cue dramatic chipmunk- hate speech!See, leftists will read that and deem the censorship completely appropriate. Liberals and censorship go together like Batman and Robin, milk and cookies or hockey and beaver pelts. Unlike canucks however, Americans are apprehensive towards the idea of censorship because of the \\u201crugged individualism\\u201d that rests at the center of our cultural landscape. We gained our freedom by flipping the bird to the monarchy\\u2026 Canada gained it by bending down, kissing the ring and making concessions. American leftists love to hold Canada in high esteem however, and often use it as a blueprint for what the United States should become (the silly accent notwithstanding).Enter \\u201chate crime\\u201d laws. For those of you who don\\u2019t know \\u2014 those who buy into the idea of \\u201chate crimes\\u201d believe that if you kill someone, a harsher sentence is merited if the victim happens to be a minority or gay. The laws are designed to place emphasis on intent, ergo criminalize thoughts in the process. See, I don\\u2019t think that murder needs a footnote. As a matter of fact, if leftists believed in harsher sentencing of convicted felons these policies wouldn\\u2019t be an issue in the first place. If only one of the four people that Tookie Williams brutally murdered had been gay, Clooney might have left his protesting shoes in the closet.See how clever this little backdoor is? When you criminalize thought through hate crime legislation, you can ultimately criminalize speech based on the premise that the words are reflective of hateful thoughts. Combine that with leftists basing their arguments on the premise that conservatives are all bigoted, homophobes (mostly because we\\u2019re all secretly gay) and you\\u2019ve got one hell of a powerful tool in your hands.You needn\\u2019t ask Ann Coulter. Just ask Stephen Boisson, a Canadian pastor who now faces fines and possible jail time due to his speaking out against homosexuality. No he didn\\u2019t beat any gay people up, no he didn\\u2019t use words that would incite violence, and no, he wasn\\u2019t even caught rejecting advances from Boy George in a Los Angeles porta-potty. He simply stood by the doctrine of his church and actively expressed himself. Canadian human rights tribunals were not happy.Whether you agree with Boisson or not, one has to ask themselves if we want that kind of a cultural shift in America. Do you want the government to have the right to tell you what you can and cannot say? Should the folks in Washington be the ones to determine whether your dissent crosses the line into the territory of \\u201chateful?\\u201d Should the \\u201crugged individualism\\u201d of America be made a relic of the past, pushed aside to make way for more legislation that fosters \\u201ctolerance?\\u201dBut most of all\\u2026 Does this mean that I can go to jail for calling Sean Penn a wiener?\", \"source_id\": 2}"
