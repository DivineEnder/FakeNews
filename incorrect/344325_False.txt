They were a photo-and-cocktail reception hosted by the Washington native Elizabeth Pierson Sainty at the Stair Sainty art gallery in Mayfair, and a cocktail-dinner at the South Kensington home of Natalie Massenet, the American-born founder ofNet-a-Porter.comand chairman of the British Fashion Council.\\\",\\\"The designers Alber Elbaz, Christopher Bailey of Burberry and Tom Ford were among the couple of hundred guests paying $500 each for the gallery event ($1,000 including a photo with Chelsea Clinton) or $2,700 for the dinner. Mr. Elbaz, who cannot vote as he is not an American citizen, said he went to support his partner, Alex Koo, who is. Mr. Bailey, who is British, is a friend of Chelsea Clinton.\\\",\\\"These were not the first times Ms. Wintour had combined fashion, expatriates and politics for Mrs. Clinton. Last fall, she hosted a similar event duringParis Fashion Weekat the Left Bank home of another Hillary Clinton supporter, James Cook, a management executive foreSensualLiving.com. Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign vice chairwoman, Huma Abedin, was the speaker at that candlelit Champagne-and-canap\\u00e9s reception.\\\",\\\"No presidential contender before Mrs. Clinton has paid such attention to the overseas vote. In fact, she is the first to have a full-time international campaign staffer, Giulia Marchiori Ceresa, an Italian-born American who studied at Barnard and Boston colleges and now lives in London.\\\",\\\"But the focus is warranted. Next week, the Democratic Party, in conjunction with Democrats Abroad, is holding the Global Presidential Primary, a seven-day-long election by email, fax, post or in person at 121 voting centers around the world to select its 21 delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. The Democratic Party launched its global primary during the 2008 campaign; the Republican Party has no equivalent.\\\",\\\"Then, next month, Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state; the former Indiana senator Evan Bayh; and the Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan will travel to London for fund-raisers; more are in the works in France.\\\",\\\"Meanwhile, even though she is now in Milan for fashion week, Ms. Wintour has been stumping for the \\u201cMade for History\\u201d T-shirts, emailing supporters via the campaign about the Clinton benefit collection: \\u201cIt includes beautiful pieces by my friends Marc Jacobs, Tory Burch, Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow. Wearing these American-made items is a wonderful way to show your support for Hillary.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re with her, I hope you\\u2019ll take a moment to look through the collection and choose a piece that expresses your support for this incredible woman.\\u201d\\\",\\\"According to a guest at the London fund-raisers, which were off the record and reportedly raised $200,000 for Hillary for America, the bulk of the attendees were from London\\u2019s well-to-do expatriate community \\u2014 a good many women; some at the early event with their tweens and teens in tow.\\\",\\\"One guest said talk was \\u201cof voter registration, Donald Trump and the upcoming primaries, as well as how good the food was.\\u201d Think sliders at the gallery, shepherd\\u2019s pie and apple crumble at the dinner. Another attendee, however, said she was too busy listening to eat.\\\",\\\"\\u201cLike many fashion events, we left hungry,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd went to China Tang at The Dorchester afterwards.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Dana Thomas contributed reporting from London.\\\"}\"}"
