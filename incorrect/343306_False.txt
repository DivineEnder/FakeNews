"{\"title\": \"Bernie Sanders Has Killer Mike in His Corner\", \"content\": \"{\\\"In July, the Twitter account of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sent a singletweetthat convinced Michael Render that this was the most exciting candidate he had ever seen.\\\",\\\"Mr. Render, better known as Killer Mike, is a rapper by trade, one half of the duo Run the Jewels. He is also steeped in political history, particularly that of his native Atlanta. The senator\\u2019s statement about the importance of restoring the Voting Rights Act wonan immediate endorsement from Killer Mike.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s official, I support @SenSanders\\u201d Mr. Render wrote on Twitter, using the senator\\u2019s handle. \\u201cHis call 4 the restoration of the voters rights act sealed the deal for me.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Since then, Mr. Render, 40, has become one of Mr. Sanders\\u2019s most visible advocates. A series of video interviews he recorded with the senator in Atlanta werepublished on YouTubein December. Collectively, the videos, which range from six to 13 minutes in length, have been viewed well over a million times.\\\",\\\"Killer Mike has also traveled with the campaign, appearing at a rally in Chicago in late December just days after having his wisdom teeth removed. On Tuesday, he appeared on \\u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\\u201d where he spoke in support of his candidate.\\\",\\\"In an interview, Mr. Render repeated the message he delivered to the \\u201cLate Show\\u201d audience, saying that Mr. Sanders\\u2019s politics were directly in line with the ideology of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\\\",\\\"\\u201cBernie Sanders has been the only politician in my lifetime that I have heard talk about reform that was directly out of King-ian organizing philosophy,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Mr. Render and other hip-hop artists who have voiced support for the senator \\u2014 includingLil B,Big BoiandBun B\\u2014 are potentially important advocates for the Sanders campaign as it attempts to chip away at Hillary Clinton\\u2019s lead among black voters. A New York Times/CBS Pollconducted last monthfound that 82 percent of African-Americans who planned to vote in the Democratic primary supported Mrs. Clinton, while just 8 percent supported Mr. Sanders.\\\",\\\"On a call with reporters on Thursday, Ron Lester, a pollster for the Clinton campaign, said that in South Carolina, Mrs. Clinton was supported by 76 percent of black voters, while Mr. Sanders was polling at 10 percent.\\\",\\\"A Clinton aide emphasized Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s support among African-Americans and named African-American artists who are supporting her campaign, includingSnoop Dogg,UsherandWaka Flocka Flame.\\\",\\\"But others say Mr. Sanders still has a chance to make up ground. While acknowledging Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s firm base of support among African-American voters, the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that \\u201cthere\\u2019s enough votes on the table for Bernie.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere are voters on the margin in the African-American community who don\\u2019t have history with the Clintons,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhen it comes to scripture, Hillary Clinton knows the message and the melody for black voters. But Hillary has to earn the votes.\\u201d\\\",\\\"She also recalled that in 2007, Mrs. Clinton had been beating Barack Obama in the polls among African-Americans. But in the course of the campaign, black voters began to make a shift to the eventual president, and ended up representing a significant part of the coalition that elected him.\\\",\\\"Mr. Render supported Mr. Obama in that election, seeing him as a landmark candidate who would provide inspiration to a generation of African-American children. But he says that from a policy perspective, he is more enthusiastic about Mr. Sanders.\\\",\\\"Mr. Render grew up in a politically engaged family. Raised by his maternal grandparents, one a Democrat, the other a \\u201cfierce libertarian,\\u201d he became an activist in his community as a teenager. He worked with Black Teens for Advancement, an anti-violence organization in Atlanta, and later with the Atlanta/Fulton Commission on Children and Youth, and its program, Kids 4 a Change.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey were my passions, rapping and organizing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOrganizing helped me feel better about being able to affect my community immediately. Organizing gave me an outlet and rap music gave me a voice.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He started rapping under the pseudonym Skunk, but a local D.J. nicknamed him Killer Mike after he outrapped a room of competitors in high school and the name stuck. He said that he is not concerned about people ignoring his message because of the name, comparing himself to other musicians who have gone by the name \\u201ckiller.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou have to say to yourself, \\u2018well Jerry Lee Lewis wasn\\u2019t a killer and the band The Killers aren\\u2019t killers, so let me Google him and see what he\\u2019s about,\\u2019\\u201d he said. If the name holds outsize weight with people, he said, they \\u201cwant to think badly of me already.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Render\\u2019s strong advocacy for Mr. Sanders is part of a long marriage between rap and politics. According to the hip-hop historian Shea Serrano, author of \\u201cThe Rap Year Book\\u201d (to which I contributed a blurb), the two have been closely intertwined since the 1980s, when politicians started condemning gangster rappers like N.W.A., and rap groups like Public Enemy were writing explicitly political songs.\\\",\\\"Now, a new generation of political rappers, of which Mr. Render is an older representative,has ascended to the national stage. Kendrick Lamar, a rapper from Compton, Calif.,who was nominated for eight Grammys this year, turned heads with \\u201cAlright,\\u201d a cutting song that prominently mentions police brutality.Vince Staples, a younger artist,has also gained notice for his social commentary.\\\",\\\"Mr. Render says the rise of his artistic profile has given his political message a boost.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI was as vocal and as adamant\\u201d in past years, he said. \\u201cJust more people are tuned in now.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Serrano agreed that any political credibility Mr. Render had with audiences was amplified by his artistic credibility.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou have this very charismatic and powerful presence in Killer Mike. I wasn\\u2019t paying attention to Bernie Sanders until Killer Mike put his name next to him. Then I was like, \\u2018I guess I better pay attention to Bernie Sanders now.\\u2019\\u200a\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think he\\u2019s done a phenomenal job, but he has a lot of ground to make up,\\u201d Ms. Brazile said of Mr. Render\\u2019s political advocacy. \\u201cBernie Sanders doesn\\u2019t have 25 years of what I call attending church. But he has people who know exactly where the churches are, and that\\u2019s a good thing.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 343306}"
