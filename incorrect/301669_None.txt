"{\"title\": \"Boris Johnson: 'Please Vote Leave on Thursday, Because We'll Never Get This Chance Again'\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"People often complain about voting these days. They say it doesn\\u2019t make any difference. They say that whatever party they choose they get the same old broken promises. In fact, they say there is no point in bothering at all.Well, whatever you say about this referendum campaign, it is a moment of fundamental decision. When you pick up your ballot paper this Thursday, you have it in your hands to transform Britain\\u2019s current democratic arrangements for the better. You can change the whole course of European history \\u2013 and if you vote Leave, I believe that change will be overwhelmingly positive.What is the Remain camp offering? Nothing. No change, no improvement, no reform; nothing but the steady and miserable erosion of parliamentary democracy in this country. If we vote Remain, we stay locked in the back of the car, driven by someone with an imperfect command of English, and going a direction we don\\u2019t want to go.If Britain votes to Remain in the EU, then we continue to be subject to an increasingly anti-democratic system that is now responsible for 60 per cent of the law that goes through Westminster \\u2013 a phenomenon that contributes so powerfully to the modern voter\\u2019s apathy, the sensation that we no longer control our destiny, and that voting changes nothing.If we vote Remain, we do nothing to rebuke the elites in Brussels who have imposed the euro on the continent, and thrown a generation of young people on the scrap-heap, and who are utterly indifferent to the misery they are causing for the sake of their bankrupt ideology.We will remain prisoners of a trade regime that will not allow this country \\u2013 the fifth biggest economy on earth \\u2013 to negotiate with America, or China or India or any of the other growth economies of the world; because that privilege is reserved exclusively for the hierarchs of the European Commission, of whose vast staff only 3.6 per cent come from this country.Read more in the\\u00a0Daily Telegraph\", \"article_id\": 301669}"
