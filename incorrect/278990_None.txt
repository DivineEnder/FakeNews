"{\"title\": \"G.I. Hans: The Rise of the Obama\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"For forty years, GI Joe has been a bellweather for America\\u2019s view of the military.   If the new GI Joe movie is any indicator, we\\u2019re headed for a dry spell for pro-military sentiment under President Obama.  Originally launched in 1963 as a male version of the Barbie doll, GI Joe\\u2019s creators intended for the \\u201caction figures\\u201d to be a tribute to the armed services (prototypes included \\u201cRocky,\\u201d the Army soldier, \\u201cSkip,\\u201d the sailor, and \\u201cAce,\\u201d the pilot).  GI Joe wore WWII or Korean War issue uniforms.   For the next five years, GI Joes (including black GI Joe figures in particular areas) would dominate the market.\\n\\nDuring the Vietnam era, Hasbro, GI Joe\\u2019s maker and distributor, decided to tone down the action figure\\u2019s military theme as a result of the Vietnam War.  Instead, Hasbro shifted the marketing to \\u201cAdventure Team,\\u201d which included turning GI Joes into superheroes and having them fight \\u201cThe Intruders: Strong Men from Another World.\\u201d  With the coming of Reagan, GI Joe regained his footing. Hasbro began marketing the product again as \\u201cGI Joe: A Real American Hero.\\u201d  The action figure even spawned a successful TV series, which touted GI Joe as \\u201cthe code name for America\\u2019s daring, highly trained special mission force.  Its purpose: to defend freedom against Cobra, a ruthless terrorist organization determined to rule the world.\\u201d  Fast forward twenty years.  Hollywood, always eager to capitalize on already-lucrative marketing, is ready to release its version of GI Joe: GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra.   And the creators of the movie are marketing it specifically to the so-called NASCAR crowd. Says Paramount Vice Chairman Rob Moore, \\u201cOur starting point for this movie is not Hollywood and Manhattan but rather mid-America.\\u201d  Or not.  Director Stephen Sommers, wary of international audiences, says that GI Joe will be in the mold of the Adventure Team 1970s. \\u201cThis is not a George Bush movie,\\u201d Sommers explains.   \\u201c[I]t\\u2019s an Obama world. Right from the writing stage we said to ourselves, this can\\u2019t be about beefy guys on steroids who all met each other in the Vietnam War, but an elite organization that\\u2019s made up of the best of the best from around the world.\\u201d  So GI Joe isn\\u2019t a Real American Hero \\u2013 he\\u2019s a UN peacekeeper. This is reminiscent of the determinedly unpatriotic Superman Returns, which deliberately refused to state that Superman was fighting for \\u201ctruth, justice and the American way.\\u201d Even GI Joe is now subject to the dictates of political correctness.  We wouldn\\u2019t want Europeans thinking that we idolize the men and women of the American military.  That would be uncouth.  This is a reflection of Hollywood\\u2019s read on the Obama Administration. When Hollywood tackled GI Joe back in the 1980s, it focused on the GI Joes as Americans through and through \\u2013 undoubtedly, a stance impacted by the renewed patriotism of the Reagan Administration.  But with Obama, it\\u2019s different \\u2013 we\\u2019re supposed to think of American soldiers as pieces in a larger coalition.  GI Joe is supposed to be GI Hans, GI Vladimir, and GI Cho.    GI Joe may be a good movie.  It may not.   But if the creators\\u2019 intentions are reflected in the film, there\\u2019s little doubt it won\\u2019t be an American movie.\", \"article_id\": 278990}"
