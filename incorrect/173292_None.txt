"{\"title\": \"LAX Allows Uber, Lyft to Pick Passengers up from Airport\", \"content\": \"Prior to the decision, ride-sharing services\\u00a0were only allowed to drop customers off at LAX.\\u00a0Much to the chagrin of taxis, they will now be able to both drop off and pick up customers.Paul Ero, a cab driver in Los Angeles for the last 19 years, was among a group of taxi drivers who reportedly protested outside of the airport administration\\u2019s building before the commissioners\\u2019 meeting, holding up signs which read \\u201cUber driver or convicted felon? BOTH.\\u201dAccording to Southern California Public Radio\\u00a0(SCPR), taxi drivers who testified before the commission said allowing ridesharing services to pick up from the airport would put taxi cabs out of business.Studies point to an 18% decrease in overall taxi business\\u2013and as SCPR notes, UCLA Labor Center Research Director Saba Waheed found that\\u00a0between 2013 and 2014, there was an increase in taxi visits to\\u00a0LAX, indicating\\u00a0\\u201cthat\\u00a0the airport is really the last lifeline for taxis in Los Angeles.\\u201dAccording to the\\u00a0Los Angeles Times,\\u00a0Airport officials said that\\u00a08% of passengers arrive at LAX by taxi, while about 6% arrive using ridesharing services. Uber and Lyft tend to be much more competitively priced than tax cabs.There is a caveat to the new deal. The\\u00a0Times notes that Uber and Lyft would be required to pay $4 for each drop-off and pickup, and that the companies would also need to pay LAX at least $25,000 per month for their new right to pick up at LAX. The new policy could start taking effect\\u00a0as soon as August of this year.Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz\\u00a0and on Facebook.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\"}"
