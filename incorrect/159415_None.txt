"{\"title\": \"Anonymous Splinter Group Wants to Infiltrate Islamic State Websites Instead of Attacking Them\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"According to a BBC report, the Ghost Security Group (GhostSec) feels the methods of Anonymous\\u2019 \\u201cOperation Paris\\u201d, which seeks to target and remove ISIS websites and social media accounts, are crude and misguided. GhostSec believes it\\u2019s better to monitor Islamic State militants than silence them.In contrast, GhostSec claims its members in the U.S., Europe, and Middle East who have linguistics skills and familiarity with \\u201cintelligence-gathering techniques.\\u201d \\u00a0They claim to have thwarted at least one major terrorist attack in Tunisia, a follow-up to the hideous beach massacre in June, by monitoring online terrorist chatter. They even report some success at infiltrating ostensibly secure networks that government intelligence analysts have had difficulty penetrating, in part because the Ghost hackers have greater latitude to use techniques of dubious legality.This claim was supported by security consultant Michael Smith of Kronos Advisory, who said Ghost operatives were good at spotting and preserving Twitter messages that militants normally delete swiftly after sending them. \\u00a0\\u201cThese people have saved lives,\\u201d Smith asserted.CNN notes that Smith, who was initially contacted by the Ghost Security Group through Twitter, has become the group\\u2019s \\u201cconduit to authorities,\\u201d as well as serving as a counterterrorism adviser to members of Congress. \\u00a0He advocates official cooperation with outside groups who can help \\u201cfind, finish, and fix the enemy.\\u201dAccording to CNN\\u2019s report, GhostSec claims to have created software that identifies probable ISIS social media accounts, and says it has infiltrated a number of such accounts, procuring data such as IP addresses to help identify the owners. \\u00a0Another success story told by Michael Smith involved Ghost hackers using these techniques to track\\u00a0down two brothers in Saudi Arabia who used Twitter to upload video of themselves murdering someone to show support for the Islamic State.It\\u2019s not clear how much active cooperation exists between intelligence officials and volunteer groups. \\u00a0Both the BBC and CNN note that the FBI has refused to comment about Ghost Security Group on the record. \\u00a0\\u201cIt\\u2019s difficult to independently verify the claims they have made,\\u201d the BBC adds.\\u201cGhost Security Group is a counter terrorism network that combats extremism on the digital front lines of today utilizing the internet and social media as a weapon. Our cyber operations consist of collecting actionable threat data, advanced analytics, offensive strategies, surveillance and providing situational awareness through relentless cyber terrain vigilance.,\\u201d the organization\\u00a0declares on its current website, which it uses to solicit tips about terrorist activity.In contrast, its previous website described its mission as \\u201celiminating\\u00a0the online presence of Islamic extremist groups such as Islamic State (IS), Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab in an effort to stymie their recruitment and limit their ability to organize international terrorist efforts,\\u201d and spoke of working to\\u00a0remove\\u00a0objectionable content instead of monitoring it, using \\u201cdigital weapons to forcibly remove content where official channels fail.\\u201d \\u00a0The old site also used Anonymous imagery, while the new one looks like a polished, professional corporate site.\\u201cWe would much prefer to stop attacks than shut down websites,\\u201d the anonymous director of Ghost, who uses the handle DigitalShadow, told the BBC. \\u00a0\\u201cI don\\u2019t think DDoS attacks do a huge amount of damage to Islamic State. Anonymous are hitting some extremist forums that have intelligence value, but we would like forums to stay online so we can see what people are saying and gather intelligence from them.\\u201dHe did, however, tell the\\u00a0Boston Herald\\u00a0that his group is still interested in shutting down terrorist sites that aren\\u2019t worth keeping intact for monitoring purposes. \\u00a0Web hosts receive a one-week warning about objectionable material before Ghost hackers take action: \\u201cIf they don\\u2019t listen to us within a week, we shut it down by force. \\u00a0Anything with intelligence value, we leave intact.\\u201dThe director said another strong difference of opinion between Anonymous and the Ghost Security Group is that his organization cooperates with the authorities \\u2013 their mission would be impossible otherwise \\u2013 while anarchic Anonymous is often in conflict with government agencies. \\u00a0DigitalShadow told the\\u00a0Boston Herald\\u00a0that Anonymous tends to get in the way even when it\\u2019s trying to help, because it doesn\\u2019t coordinate with government agencies, so the feds may end up wasting time and money on monitoring \\u201cundercover\\u201d Anonymous operatives instead of real terrorists.When the Ghost Security Group officially announced itself a few weeks ago, it mocked Anonymous for their \\u201choodies and Guy Fawkes masks,\\u201d and their affinity for \\u201cpublicity\\u00a0stunts and distributed denial-of-service attacks on government, religious, and corporate websites.\\u201d\\u201cWe have data. We can\\u2019t do anything with that data unless we work with the US government. They have the guns and the boots on the ground, they can disrupt terrorist operations,\\u201d the director explained.Anonymous, in turn, accused the Ghost Security Group of \\u201ccozying up to governments and exaggerating its accomplishments,\\u201d while claiming their own crusade to shut down ISIS websites was having a more significant effect on the terror state, by interfering with its recruiting operations.DigitalShadow told CNN his group has 14 active members, who are working an average of 16 hours a day on Ghost assignments, with no compensation beyond some Bitcoin donations from supporters. \\u00a0He described the Charlie Hebdo\\u00a0massacre last January as the event that inspired them to splinter from Anonymous, while the more recent Paris terrorist bloodbath made them realize it was time for a clean break.\\u201cWe realized for the first time, you could be [attacked] in the streets of Paris and attacked in [your] hometown in America. \\u00a0Everybody could become a victim. So we wanted to do what we could to help slow them down,\\u201d CNN quotes the director saying.\\u201cIf we were to stop now, lives would be at risk. It\\u2019s not a choice, it\\u2019s more of a way of life for us now,\\u201d he added.We are determined that before the sun sets on this struggle we will be seen as a symbol of freedom. #GhostSecGroup pic.twitter.com/yV9vGS7uCE\\u2014 DigitaShadow (@DigitaShadow) November 21, 2015\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"article_id\": 159415}"
