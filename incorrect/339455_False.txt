"{\"title\": \"Jocelyn Cooper\\u2019s Workhorse of a Skillet\", \"content\": \"{\\\"\\u201cSmothered chicken,\\u201d Jocelyn Cooper said without hesitation. \\u201cMy favorite dish, my dying meal.\\u201d\\\",\\\"She stood at her stove in roughly the same spot where her grandmother once stood, in the brownstone in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, that her grandparents moved to from Harlem in 1926. Her father was born in a bedroom upstairs.\\\",\\\"When Ms. Cooper, 50, was growing up, this was the house that she hurried to after school, to watch her grandmother, a native of Charleston, S.C., make monumental amounts of mac and cheese (out of spaghetti, milk, half-and-half and sharp Cheddar, mixed in a child\\u2019s bathtub) and that beloved smothered chicken, fired in a cast-iron skillet and left to wallow in gravy.\\\",\\\"Now Ms. Cooper \\u2014 a former head of artist and repertoire at Universal Records and one of the forces behindAfropunk, which started out asan underground music festivaland has turned into a movement promoting a broader vision of the black urban experience \\u2014 was wielding a cast-iron skillet of her own, stirring a hash of smoked trout, potatoes and caramelized onions.\\\",\\\"The heavy pan is the workhorse of her kitchen. \\u201cI use it every day, for everything,\\u201d she said: pancakes, vegetables, meat. She keeps two skillets on hand and sometimes sets both going at once.\\\",\\\"As she shook the pan, she greeted members of the Afropunk staff who were coming in to work; the house doubles as her home and office. When she turned 26, she lobbied her father and her uncles, who had inherited the brownstone, to let her buy it. Since then, apart from a year with a boyfriend in Bushwick, Brooklyn, she hasn\\u2019t strayed. The kitchen has been updated, but the stove and refrigerator remain in the spaces staked out by their ancestors.\\\",\\\"Although her grandmother didn\\u2019t write down recipes, Ms. Cooper still makes her Carolina rice, stewed okra and tomatoes, tapioca pudding and 1-2-3 cake. She carries on family tradition in her work as well, as the kind of person the civil rights activist Bayard Rustin would have called an \\u201cangelic troublemaker.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Her mother registered voters on the sidewalk. Now, Ms. Cooper does it on a large scale at the annual Afropunk festival in Commodore Barry Park in Brooklyn, which is in August. Her father,Andrew W. Cooper, the founder and publisher of the black weekly newspaper The City Sun, brought a landmark lawsuit against the federal government in 1966 that challenged Bedford-Stuyvesant\\u2019s congressional district lines, which led to the election of the first black woman to Congress. This year, Afropunk festivalgoers can earn tickets by doing community service.\\\",\\\"Some traditions Ms. Cooper resists, however. She loves her skillet, but she doesn\\u2019t hold with all the lore on how to take care of it. \\u201cI\\u2019m not that precious,\\u201d she said. She washes it with soap and occasionally even puts it in the dishwasher, then restores it with a slap of olive oil and a quick warm-up on the stove.\\\",\\\"\\u201cMy grandmother\\u2019s had a crust on the bottom,\\u201d she said. \\u201cShe just wiped it out. I wondered, Is that good for the pan?\\u201d She paused. \\u201cIs it good for us?\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 339455}"
