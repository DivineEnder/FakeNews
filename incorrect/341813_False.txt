Hopes to Stemming Flow of Refugees\", \"article_id\": 341813, \"content\": \"{\\\"ISTANBUL \\u2014 Desperately seeking help to contain Europe\\u2019smigrant crisis, ChancellorAngela MerkelofGermanyon Sunday explicitly linked acceleratingTurkey\\u2019s effort to join theEuropean Unionto Turkish cooperation in clamping down on the flow of refugees fromTurkeyto Europe.\\\",\\\"Ms. Merkel, who has long opposed Turkey\\u2019s admission to the bloc, said she would support speeding up the process, a concession that underscored the importance European leaders place on Turkey\\u2019s cooperation in trying to contain what has become the largest flow of migrants since World War II, as people flee violence and deprivation in the Middle East and Africa.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNo country can shoulder the refugee burden alone,\\u201d Ms. Merkel said at a news conference with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey in Istanbul on Sunday. \\u201cThe job has to be shared.\\u201d\\\",\\\"For weeks, a deal in principle between Europe andTurkeyhas been discussed: it would include almost three billion euros, or about $3.4 billion, to help Turkey deal with nearly 2.2 million refugees, mostly fromSyria, who now live in Turkey. At the news conference, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Davutoglu said no agreement had been finalized and that the details were still being worked out.\\\",\\\"Mr. Davutoglu continued to press for a \\u201csafe zone\\u201d in northern Syria, a longstanding priority for Turkey that has been met largely by silence from the international community, because it would require a substantial military operation.\\\",\\\"Mr. Davutoglu said: \\u201cOur priority is to prevent illegal immigration and reduce the number of people crossing our borders. In that respect, we have had very fruitful discussions with the E.U.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He said he hoped that Turkish prime ministers could once again attendEuropean Unionsummit meetings, noting that the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdogan, went to one in 2004 as prime minister, but then such visits stopped. \\u201cWe hope Turkey will take a place in the E.U. family photo,\\u201d Mr. Davutoglu said.\\\",\\\"In the early evening, Ms. Merkel met with Mr. Erdogan, Turkey\\u2019s pre-eminent decision maker, and they also discussed the migrant crisis, as well as the European Union accession process and counterterrorism.\\\",\\\"In a statement, Mr. Erdogan said he had asked Ms. Merkel for support in accelerating Turkey\\u2019s efforts to join the union.\\\",\\\"From the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Turkey has had an open-door policy for refugees and has spent billions of dollars caring for them. Now that Europe has been drawn into the crisis, Turkish leaders have been quick to point out that Turkey had been \\u201cleft alone in recent years,\\u201d as Mr. Davutoglu put it on Sunday.\\\",\\\"In the negotiations, Turkey has made visa-free travel to Europe for its citizens a top priority, and Ms. Merkel said she had agreed to push that issue forward. Turkey is the only country that has been formally accepted for possible membership in the union whose citizens must have visas to travel to Europe.\\\",\\\"Turkey has long sought to join the European Union \\u2014 formal talks began in 2005 \\u2014 but the process has stalled in recent years, partly because of European concerns about Turkey\\u2019s human rights record and a government crackdown on the news media and freedom of expression.\\\",\\\"Now, though, the balance of power has shifted in Turkey\\u2019s favor. Europe needsTurkey, which hosts the largest number of refugees in the world, to stem the flow of refugees and migrants who are leaving Turkey\\u2019s shores for Greece and then toward other countries on the Continent. So the concerns about rights are largely unspoken by European leaders at the moment.\\\",\\\"For example, a European Union report on Turkey, part of the accession process, that was expected to be deeply critical of Ankara\\u2019s record on free speech, has been delayed.\\\",\\\"This has raised criticisms from analysts and activists who say that Europe is willing to overlook the increasing authoritarianism of the Turkish government in exchange for cooperation on the migrant problem. Ms. Merkel\\u2019s visit took place less than two weeks before snap elections in which Mr. Erdogan\\u2019s Justice and Development Party aims to regain its parliamentary majority, which it lost in a vote in June.\\\",\\\"Amnesty International, in a statement issued just before the visit, took aim at another of Turkey\\u2019s demands: that it be designated a \\u201csafe country of origin,\\u201d meaning that Turkish asylum seekers be denied refugee status in Europe.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt would be utterly callous and disingenuous to describe Turkey as a place of safety,\\u201d Andrew Gardner, the group\\u2019s Turkey researcher, said in a statement, which also noted the increased violence here recently, as hostilities have resumed between the government and the Kurdistan Workers\\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., a militant group that has long fought for the rights and autonomy of Turkey\\u2019s Kurdish minority.\\\",\\\"The statement continued: \\u201cThere has been an escalation of violence between the P.K.K. and the army and police, along with a general deterioration of the human rights situation across the board. We have seen waves of arrests of political activists under vague antiterror laws and further attacks on freedom of expression, with a spike in the number of cases of ill treatment of detainees.\\u201d\\\",\\\"This criticism has been echoed by some European leaders.\\\",\\\"Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, said recently in an interview: \\u201cI actually think the E.U. is not vocal enough in expressing the deep concerns over the rule of law and restrictions of people\\u2019s rights and freedoms in Turkey. Often when I speak with people in Turkey, they get a sense that the E.U. is blind to the deep polarization and tension in society.\\u201d\\\"}\"}"
