But the report is nowhere close to correct. Negotiations are still going on. But I was carrying groceries and walking, so I said it was a long shot and it probably won't happen.\\\"A representative from Rendell's office also sent an email denying Goldman's story. \\\"This report is incorrect,\\\" Kristin Snow wrote. \\\"Negotiations remain ongoing and there are no new developments.\\\"More on Rendell's controversial Inquirer bid here and here.UPDATE: Goldman emails to take issue with Rendell's characterization of their encounter:Rendell was not carrying groceries. He was on the phone and got off the phone to talk to me. I did not wish him well because I am against him buying the papers for fear that they will not be independent. I like him as a person.He was going into Schlessinger's Deli to buy food, but he did not have food. I have confirmed that with the manager.I did not wish him well. I asked what was happening. I love Rendell as a person and a politician, but I am worried about him controlling the press so I would never have said good luck.Goldman has also posted an extended explanation about her encounter with Rendell.\", \"title\": \"Ed Rendell: Inquirer negotiations continue\"}"
