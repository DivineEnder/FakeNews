"{\"article_id\": 348265, \"content\": \"{\\\"What is bad taste? How much is too much? Why do we say yes? On the eve of their London exhibition, the fashion curator Judith Clark and the psychoanalyst Adam Phillips pry open the excessive and the ugly for interpretation.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTaste governs every free \\u2014 as opposed to rote \\u2014 human response. Nothing is more decisive.\\u201d \\u2014 Susan Sontag\\\",\\\"When I first read Sontag\\u2019s quote I read \\u201cdecisive\\u201d as \\u201cdivisive.\\u201d As I write this I consider the word \\u201cvulgar.\\u201d Most things in my childhood weren\\u2019t judged as anything. They were barely afforded. While we weren\\u2019t poor, we were not rich. We bought day-old bread and lived near the tracks. But in a large warm house full of objects. In terms of taste, my father owned a Raymond Loewy Studebaker Avanti but delighted in the kitsch and excess of chrome car culture. My mother permed her straight Filipino hair and had a bookkeeping job and shopped for things that looked like other, more expensive things. I am the daughter of a first-generation immigrant and a working-class libertarian industrial designer. I am attuned to blunt social signifiers and very specific functional beauty.\\\",\\\"From my mother\\u2019s perspective, we were trying to fit in, and from my father\\u2019s, we were trying to distinguish ourselves, if not with money, then with nonconformity. As a teen, I colored in the horse on my one Polo shirt so it would appear more visible as my father looked on in dismay. My mother called me a tart when I wore a short red velvet vintage dress to a formal dance in high school. I painted my kitten heels red with acrylics.\\\",\\\"When I ask friends the last time they said the word vulgar, nobody admits to using it. \\u201cI guess I occasionally think it,\\u201d one offers. An 11-year-old says she thinks she heard a friend use it to describe another girl and her clothes. It\\u2019s an outdated word. Yet loaded. Fully illustrated in our minds, usually by exposed flesh, exposed ambition, exposed aspiration. Blunt appropriation and imitation. I think of Instagram. A closer look at the vulgar feels prescient, as shaming is flagged, as sexuality transitions, as immigration and borders are disputed. Who, really, is afraid of mutton dressed as lamb?\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe Vulgar: Fashion Redefined\\u201d is the title of an exhibition that opens on Oct. 13 at the Barbican in London. It is being curated by two remarkable people: Judith Clark and Adam Phillips. They also live together, with their children. Clark is a curator and exhibition-maker. She\\u2019s a pioneering practitioner and educator in the field of exhibiting fashion, teaching museology at the London College of Fashion, lecturing on issues of dress display and design, all while creating shows in department stores, galleries, foundations and museums worldwide. Phillips is a psychoanalyst and writer known for his incisive and aphoristic writing on psychotherapy and life. He works prolifically, publishing a book every year or two, writing only one day a week, the other four spent in consultation with his patients.\\\",\\\"I flew to London to talk to Clark and Phillips about the vulgar. I am curious about them as a couple in work and life, as Clark\\u2019s interest lies with the presentation of the dressed body, the visual or the embodied, and Phillips\\u2019s with the presentation of the mind, or the invisible and disembodied. The vulgar suits both Clark\\u2019s and Phillips\\u2019s disciplines, as it\\u2019s simultaneously about language and about dress.\\\",\\\"Clark and Phillips challenged my preconceptions of the word, which is exactly what they intend to do with their show. At one point, Phillips asked me what I\\u2019d done to prepare for the interview. My impulse, as a weekly subject of psychotherapy, was to answer him honestly: \\u201cNot much.\\u201d I\\u2019d reread the book that accompanied his previous collaboration with Clark, \\u201cThe Concise Dictionary of Dress\\u201d; Clark\\u2019s catalog for her exhibition on Chlo\\u00e9 at the Palais de Tokyo in 2012; half of Phillips\\u2019s book \\u201cMissing Out\\u201d; Susan Sontag\\u2019s essay \\u201cNotes on Camp\\u201d; and, on the flight to London, watched \\u201cZoolander 2.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The form of notes that follows parodies Sontag\\u2019s attempt to define the word \\u201ccamp\\u201d in 1964. I also hope it captures what it is like to talk to Clark and Phillips, who, rather than define, prefer to offer options for interpretation. In their hands, definition is an active process.\\\",\\\"1. To start very generally: The word vulgar comes from the Latinvulgus, meaning the common people.Il volgaremeant, in Italian, the vernacular, non-Latin, language.\\\",\\\"2. To me, the word vulgar acts as a behavioral autocorrect, an authority that protects me from being what ... What? My definitions included ersatz, brash, kitsch, offensive, gaudy, raunchy, inappropriate. All things I could probably afford to be, and even longed to be more of. As I packed my suitcase for London I included some clothes that I felt were more vulgar than usual. A Moschino cardigan, a Lycra dress printed with globs of jewels. Europe brings out my Eurotrash aspirations.\\\",\\\"3. In his catalog essay, Phillips writes: \\u201cVulgar is either what the vast majority of us are; or the vulgar are those who ... pretend to be something we would like to be.\\u201d\\\",\\\"4. Examples of the items Judith Clark plans to include in \\u201cThe Vulgar\\u201d:\\\",\\\"A Madame Gr\\u00e8s silk crepeline goddess dress from 1955A pair of boots covered in British pound signsA brocaded silk court mantua from 1750An 18th-century stomacherThe book \\u201cEtiquette for Everyday\\u201d from 1904An Elsa Schiaparelli evening ensemble circa 1937A Walter Van Beirendonck suit from 2016A bevy of cherubs fan, circa 1860sA 2003 Gucci ad photographed by Mario TestinoA Viennese bonnet from 1798A Courr\\u00e8ges minidress from 1960A Philip Treacy smiley-face hat from 2013A Rudi Gernreich bathing suit from 1964\\\",\\\"5. I meet Clark at a cafe. She is wearing a bright red apron and she hugs me. I\\u2019ve gotten to know her over the past two years. A dinner in London, tea in New York. It is good to see her open and delicate face again, her brown symmetrically parted hair, her apron slung over a version of the outfit she seems always to be wearing: inscrutable and well-cut navy blue and black. She is an Australian, born and raised in Rome. Her voice is low and she speaks in perfect compound sentences, often ending them in a smile or nod, the way some Italians end a statement with a complicit, \\u201cYes?\\u201d\\\",\\\"6. Until recently, fashion has been seen by museums as a minor, applied aesthetic, too close to the marketplace to be art. Fashion exhibitions were considered vulgar. \\u201cThe debate still rages,\\u201d Clark shrugs.\\\",\\\"7. I love going to exhibitions of dress. They require low lights and temperature control to protect the fabric and I walk slowly through the cool, dark displays. The ambience is a little out of space and time; there is moody music. I find the question of whether fashion belongs in a museum dressist.\\\",\\\"8. The show opens on the 20th anniversary of the 1996 Biennale di Firenze show \\u201cTime and Fashion,\\u201d curated by Luigi Settembrini, Germano Celant and Ingrid Sischy. A show, Clark explains, \\u201cI traveled to and stayed in a dingy hotel and went quasi-religiously to. ... It gave me the kind of permission, cultural permission, to open a gallery exhibiting dress.\\u201d A few months later, she opened Judith Clark Costume Gallery, a nonprofit experimental space dedicated to exhibiting dress, in a tiny storefront in Notting Hill.\\\",\\\"9. As we look though Clark\\u2019s notebooks I ask her what she is reading. \\u201cI\\u2019m reading \\u2018Love of Beginnings,\\u2019 by Jean-Bertrand Pontalis. It\\u2019s about the idea of resisting psychoanalysis as a language that explains all others because it stops language.\\u201d She nods. \\u201cOne thing that I\\u2019m interested in, and I think is one of the things that Adam and I have in common in that sense, in terms of the \\u2018Vulgar\\u2019 project, is to open up interpretation, not shut it down.\\u201d\\\",\\\"10. For Phillips, ideas of the vulgar were linked, being Jewish, to his preoccupations with snobbishness and superiority. To him it was a ruling-class term and one that was attached to immigrants, arrivistes, to nouveau riche Jews.\\\",\\\"11. \\u201cTaste classifies, and it classifies the classifier.\\u201d \\u2014 Pierre Bourdieu\\\",\\\"12. At a glance, Phillips looks like the actor Robert Shaw (Quint from \\u201cJaws\\u201d). His Notting Hill office sits at the top of three flights of stairs. In his consulting room, the floor is covered in grayish-blue carpet. The desk is piled high with books and papers. A small fridge and kettle are tucked behind the door. His floor-to-ceiling gray-painted bookshelves stand on either side of the desk and along a wall behind a comfortable leather couch. While the pieces are unremarkable and the space has no decorative flourishes, the room has a bright, comforting feeling of equilibrium and contemplation. Phillips sits in a sturdy wooden chair. He first saw Clark from one of the two office windows, in 1997.\\\",\\\"13. Phillips likes making strong points softly. For example, in a paragraph about clich\\u00e9 in his catalog essay, he buries this in a little aside: \\u201cClich\\u00e9s are there to stop us being suspicious.\\u201d He stops short of overexplanation, inviting a reader, or listener, to meet him halfway.\\\",\\\"14. Michael Morris, one of the founders of Artangel, worked closely with the pair on their last joint project, \\u201cThe Concise Dictionary of Dress.\\u201d He was impressed by the way they were with each other. \\u201cThe way that couples listen to each other is always a sign of connection. I was struck by the way Adam and Judith communicated. The way that they are delighted in each other\\u2019s creativity is fantastic.\\u201d\\\",\\\"15. I meet Clark at the Barbican. Today, instead of an apron, she is wearing a lab coat given to her by the craftspeople at the historic Louis Vuitton workshop in Asni\\u00e8res and her smile is sharpened by bright red lipstick. As we walk through the space, Clark describes how the show will be laid out, beginning with a 15th-century piece of gold cloth, part of a chasuble, next to an Elsa Schiaparelli gown. \\u201cPeople assume that they can picture the quintessential vulgar outfit.\\u201d\\\",\\\"16. The Barbican show is divided into sections, which include titles like: \\u201cNymphs,\\u201d \\u201cClassic Copies,\\u201d \\u201cToo Big,\\u201d \\u201cToo Much,\\u201d \\u201cShowing Off,\\u201d \\u201cImpossible Ambition\\u201d and \\u201cOes and Spangles.\\u201d\\\",\\\"17. \\u201cThe word is used too often pejoratively and too limitedly,\\u201d Phillips says as he hands me a cup of coffee in his office. \\u201cThe vulgar is a version of the discerned, or scapegoat of good taste.\\u201d He continues, \\u201cThere are a lot of people for whom the vulgar is a precondition for sexual desire.\\u201d\\\",\\\"18. At the time of this writing, Dolce &amp; Gabbana\\u2019s public relations team has declined to loan pieces for inclusion in the Barbican show.\\\",\\\"19. \\u201cI think a lot of the pieces in the show are rather iconic,\\u201d Clark says. \\u201cThey are recognized as being moments in transition. In the exhibition, by virtue of having a dress that has already been classified as fashionable or fashionable at one time, it has within it already the project of reimagining beauty. Even if it\\u2019s in the past, it\\u2019s in the future, as fashion always is.\\u201d\\\",\\\"20. Phillips brings up an 1822 Stendhal quote: \\u201cBeauty is the promise of happiness.\\u201d This reminds me of two other quotes. In 1790, in his \\u201cProverbs of Hell,\\u201d William Blake simply stated: \\u201cExuberance is Beauty.\\u201d And in 1853, Flaubert wrote to the poet Louise Colet: \\u201cWhat artists we would be if we had never read, seen or loved anything that was not beautiful; if from the outset some guardian angel of the purity of our pens had kept us from all contamination. ...Life! Life! To have erections! That is everything, the only thing that counts!\\u201d\\\",\\\"21. \\u201cThe supposedly vulgar enjoy their art of imitation and excess, of pretending to be something they are not, of performing themselves as different, as more like something they would want to be. Those who judge enjoy their amused ridicule, self-assurance on matters of taste and propriety, their performing of themselves as they know themselves to be ... The vulgar pretending to be someone else, their judges pretending to be themselves.\\u201d \\u2014 from Phillips\\u2019s Barbican catalog essay\\\",\\\"22. \\u201cFake it till you make it.\\u201d \\u2014 My mother\\\",\\\"23. Phillips explains that unlike the word \\u201ccamp,\\u201d the word \\u201cvulgar\\u201d is not a sensibility, or a quality. \\u201cIt is a description that is used to do things to people and objects.\\u201d He continues. \\u201cI would like it to be a useful term of art as opposed to a straightforward, simple-minded insult. I think it\\u2019s got a lot going for it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"24. To avoid preconceived assumptions of the word, Clark and Phillips have decided to tell the story of the vulgar with a straight face. The mannequins Clark will use, in a suite of subtle postures, are a classic type called Schlappi, used most famously by Diana Vreeland at the Met Costume Institute. The figures will be covered in an unbleached woven museum cloth called calico. Like a well-delivered joke, this neutral ground highlights the humor and joyous side of the vulgar.\\\",\\\"25. \\u201cThose who laugh are always right.\\u201d \\u2014 Coco Chanel\\\",\\\"26. In a nutshell, the cultural theorist Aby Warburg changed the course of art history by giving precedence to subject and use, rather than to when an artwork was made and who by. He considered all graphic representation worthy of study, including stamps, posters and costume, and believed in a pictorial cultural memory. Warburg\\u2019s conviction that images are viral and transmitted through patterns and recurrence is evident in Clark\\u2019s work. She believes dress performs the essential Warburgian idea of an image surviving in various incarnations.\\\",\\\"27. Warburg studied poses, (and may have delighted in the idea of vogueing). His \\u201cMnemosyne Atlas\\u201d is a collection of 63 black panels upon which he pinned images of art history and cosmology, mixed with pictures cut from newspapers and magazines. They look like mood boards.\\\",\\\"28. When I ask if her audiences understand all of her references, Clark smiles: \\u201cDo people reflect back to me the entirety of my intention? No. If I were to write every intention in the captions, it would be bullying. It would be like telling the visitor what to see and actually the visitormightbe seeing something, well, certainly is seeing something personal.\\u201d\\\",\\\"29. It was reading Carl Jung and D.W. Winnicott that made Phillips want to become a psychoanalyst, and it occurs to me that Jung\\u2019s collective unconsciousness and Warburg\\u2019s study of cultural memory, archetype and iconology overlap in their ideas of nonverbal transmission. It\\u2019s where Clark and Phillips overlap too, in complex unconscious communication.\\\",\\\"30. In Phillips\\u2019s first book, on Winnicott, he points out that while Freud\\u2019s psychoanalysis \\u201cwas essentially a \\u2018talking cure,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d for Winnicott, \\u201cthe defining characteristic of the analytic setting was not exclusively verbal exchange.\\u201d He quotes Winnicott: \\u201cThe word infant implies \\u2018not talking\\u2019 (infans).\\u201d\\\",\\\"31. The last time I used the word vulgar was to describe an amaryllis.\\\",\\\"32. After this immersion in vulgarity, I try to be more so. I talk about money. I wear a cheap strapless frilly dress to a tasteful dinner, and instead of a bottle of wine, bring an accordion paper pineapple. Attuned to the shaming qualities of the word, I err on the side of the vulgar, just to see how it feels. It feels fun.\\\",\\\"33. Phillips\\u2019s 2012 book, \\u201cMissing Out: In Praise of the Unlived Life,\\u201d is, among other things, about the possibility of discovering satisfaction in what we believe we lack. A friend once pointed out that she doesn\\u2019t dress for men or for women, she dresses for an idea of her future self.\\\",\\\"34. We leave Phillips\\u2019s office and walk to an Italian restaurant. Reading the menu is like getting dressed: We ask each other what we want, we think about what to share. We order fries alongside our bresaola and Gavi di Gavi. We are all looking forward to our uneaten meal. Three courses each.\\\",\\\"35. \\u201cThe vulgar,\\u201d Phillips says, \\u201crefuse to miss out.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"title\": \"The Art of Vulgarity\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
