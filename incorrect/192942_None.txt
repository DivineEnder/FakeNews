"{\"title\": \"World View: Palestinians Divided over Taking Israel to International Criminal Court\", \"content\": \"Israel\\u2019s Defense Force (IDF) has launched criminal probes overseveral incidents involving it soldiers during the Gaza war.In a July 16 incident, Israeli forces fired on a beach in Gaza City,killing four children who were playing there. Just over a week later,a UN school in the northern city of Beit Hanun was shelled by theIsraelis, killing at least 15 people.\\u00a0This will be part of an overall review by IDF.  There willbe 12 main review teams, each headed by a high-level IDF officer.Among the issues being reviewed are: the use of firepower during theoperation; the maneuvering of ground forces; the IDF\\u2019s readiness todeal with the tunnel threat; the decision to amass forces at a stagingground despite it being within range of mortar fire; the use ofobsolete armored personnel carriers in fighting; intelligence; airdefense; and coordination between the air, ground and naval forces.\\u00a0Pro-Hamas activists are condemning the investigations as a\\nAnother motive attributed to Israel is to head off an investigation bythe International Criminal Court (ICC).  Generally speaking, the ICCcan gain jurisdiction over war crimes cases only if the countryinvolved is unwilling or unable to investigate itself.  Deutsche Welle and Israel HayomSenior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh is pressuring Mahmoud Abbas,president of the Palestinian Authority (PA/Fatah), to sign a documentthat would give the International Criminal Court (ICC) jurisdictionto investigate alleged war crimes by Israel in the recent Gazawar.  In a press statement, Haniyeh said:\\u00a0The Palestinian factions and Palestinian communityall agree on the need for Abbas to go to the ICC and sign the RomeStatute in order to prosecute the leaders of the Zionist enemy fortheir crimes committed against the Palestinian people\\u2026Hamas signed the document urging Abbas to sign the Rome Statute,and the signing of this is the right of all the victims.  Stallingthe signing of the Statute is considered a concession of theirrights and offensive to the Palestinian people and theirstruggle.Haniyeh\\u2019s remarks come as pro-Hamas officials and activists expresspuzzlement and outrage that Abbas in August explicitly refused to signthe document that would give ICC jurisdiction over Israel\\u2019s allegedwar crimes.  Abbas is the head of the Hamas-Fatah unity government,and so his approval is required before the ICC can act on any documentprovided by the Palestinians.\\u00a0Various reports give several possible reasons for Abbas\\u2019s refusal:\\u00a0Another reason is related to the  Mideast realignment following the Gaza war that we\\u2019ve writtenabout in several articles.  There is a growing fault line separatingIsrael plus Egypt plus Saudi Arabia plus PA/Fatah versus the Hamasplus Qatar plus Turkey.  To put bluntly, Abbas considers Hamas to behis enemy, and does not want to empower Hamas in a way that wouldhappen if Abbas enabled an ICC war crime investigation of Israel.Ma\\u2019aN News (Bethlehem) and Middle East Eye andMiddle East Monitor and Israel National NewsThe plans announced in President Obama\\u2019s Wednesday speech to form aSyria (IS or ISIS) have been running into some roadblocks.\\u00a0Turkey made a surprise announcement on Thursday that it would not beparticipating, and would not allow American warplanes to use its airbases.  Turkey has internal political considerations, and ISIS isholding 49 Turkish diplomats as hostages.\\u00a0Arab states, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, are reluctantto participate because they would face retaliation by jihadistterrorist groups.  Nato allies Britain and Germany are also reluctant,and France is completely ruling out participation.  Politicians inmany countries note that President Obama has reneged on commitmentsbefore, and so many of these countries are reluctant to commit theirown resources when it\\u2019s not clear that Obama is fully committed.\\u00a0It\\u2019s possible that some of these countries will provide \\u201cquietcooperation,\\u201d but right now it looks like America will be the onlycountry performing air strikes, and no country except Iraq willprovide combat troops.  I have not heard any analyst indicate that theproject will be successful without substantially more cooperation, andright now there are few signs that that cooperation is coming.  It\\u2019spossible that officials in some countries will change their minds oncethe operation begins.
