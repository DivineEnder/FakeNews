"{\"content\": \"A Rasmussen poll released Tuesday that surveyed 1000 likely voters found that ABC News\\u2019s George Stephanopoulos is suffering a credibility crisis every but as crippling as the one NBC\\u2019s Brian Williams went through earlier this year. A plurality of 46% of those polled want ABC News to ban its chief anchor and political correspondent from 2016 campaign coverage. Only 36% disagreed.Even among Democrats, 30% want the former-Clinton White House official banned; 50% of Democrats disagree. A full 66% of Republicans and 45% of unaffiliated voters don\\u2019t want to see Stephanopoulos cover the 2016 campaign for ABC News.The overall credibility of the face and name of ABC News has also taken a substantial hit in the wake of the news that Stephanopoulos lied to ABC News and his viewers about $75,000 in donations to the Clinton Foundation. In February, 45% of those polled had a favorable opinion of Stephanopoulos. That has since dropped to just 34%.In general, 34% of voters have lost faith in Stephanopoulos as someone believable; 42% say the scandal has had no impact.What should be especially worrying for ABC News is how closely these numbers mirror the credibility collapse Brian Williams faced after his serial-fabrications were exposed back in February. Forty percent of \\u00a0Americans said Williams \\u201chad to go.\\u201d \\u00a0As mentioned above, a full 46% want Stephanopoulos off the 2016 campaign beat.\\u00a0Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 151123, \"title\": \"Poll: Plurality of 46% Want Stephanopoulos Banned From Campaign Coverage\"}"
