"{\"content\": \"{\\\"A day aftera reportcommissioned by the N.F.L. indicated that it was \\u201cmore probable than not\\u201d that quarterbackTom Bradywas at least generally aware ofPatriotspersonnel deflating footballs to gain an advantage, Brady appeared at a previously scheduled event at Salem State University in Salem, Mass.\\\",\\\"The sportscaster Jim Gray, who interviews Brady regularly on radio broadcasts of \\u201cMonday Night Football,\\u201d moderated the discussion with Brady on Thursday at the O\\u2019Keefe Center during a sold-out event that was part of the high-profile Salem State Series.\\\",\\\"In his first public appearance since the report was released Wednesday, Brady emerged from a helicopter wearing sunglasses, a navy suit jacket and khaki pants. He was greeted by a number of onlookers, many of whom were wearing Brady jerseys. Most of the people in attendance cheered when he arrived onstage and chanted, \\u201cM.V.P.\\u201d\\\",\\\"At the start of the event, he largely deflected questions about the report, the mere mention of which drew boos from the crowd.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOur owner commented on it yesterday, and it\\u2019s only been 30 hours, so I haven\\u2019t been able to digest it fully, but when I do, I will address it,\\u201d said Brady, whoearned his third Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Awardwhen the Patriotsdefeated the Seattle Seahawks, 28-24, in theSuper Bowlin February.\\\",\\\"Asked when that will be, he said: \\u201cHopefully soon. It\\u2019s a process that I\\u2019m involved in.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The Salem State Series, founded in 1982, has showcased a number of world leaders, artists, athletes and intellectuals on the university\\u2019s suburban North Shore campus, but perhaps a guest has never drawn as much attention as Brady. Salem State, a Division III college about 15 miles north of Boston, does not even have a football program.\\\",\\\"The only other campus event to draw nearly as much attention was when Bill Clinton spoke as part of the series shortly after he left the White House in 2001, Athletic Director Tim Shea said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt worked out great for our university because the timing was so perfect,\\u201d said Shea, a former women\\u2019s basketball coach who is set to retire after 34 years at the university. \\u201cMaybe it will have a ripple effect when coaches are talking to recruits about coming here.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The investigation, which was conducted by Theodore V. Wells Jr. and the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, concluded it was probable that Patriots personnel were \\u201cinvolved in a deliberate effort to circumvent the rules.\\u201d Brady \\u201cdeclined to make available any documents or electronic information (including text messages and emails),\\u201d according to the report.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019ve dealt with a lot of things in the past, and I\\u2019m very fortunate to have people who love me and support me,\\u201d Brady said Thursday. \\u201cI accept my role and responsibility as a public figure.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He continued, amid bursts of telling those in the crowd that he loved them, too, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll get through it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Asked by Gray if the scandal tarnished the Patriots\\u2019 Super Bowl victory, Brady said with a smile, \\u201cAbsolutely not.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Earlier in the day, Brady\\u2019s agent, Don Yee, released a statement calling the report \\u201ca significant and terrible disappointment.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cIts omission of key facts and lines of inquiry suggest the investigators reached a conclusion first, and then determined so-called facts later,\\u201d Yee said. \\u201cOne item alone taints this entire report. What does it say about the league office\\u2019s protocols and ethics when it allows one team to tip it off to an issue prior to a championship game, and no league officials or game officials notified the Patriots of the same issue prior to the game? This suggests it may be more probable than not that the league cooperated with the Colts in perpetrating a sting operation.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He added: \\u201cThe league is a significant client of the investigators\\u2019 law firm; it appears to be a rich source of billings and media exposure based on content in the law firm\\u2019s website. This was not an independent investigation and the contents of the report bear that out \\u2014 all one has to do is read closely and critically, as opposed to simply reading headlines.\\u201d\\\",\\\"No penalties against Brady or the Patriots have been announced by the N.F.L. In a statement Wednesday, Commissioner Roger Goodell said that Troy Vincent, the league\\u2019s executive vice president for football operations, and his group would \\u201cconsider what steps to take in light of the report, both with respect to possible disciplinary action and to any changes in protocols.\\u201d\\\",\\\"It is not the first time that it has been concluded that the Patriots broke rules to gain an advantage. In 2007, the league fined the Patriots and Coach Bill Belichick and ordered the team to forfeit a first-round draft pick after a Patriots staff member was discovered videotaping signals by Jets coaches at the Meadowlands.\\\"}\", \"title\": \"Regarding Report, Tom Brady Says, \\u2018I Will Address It\\u2019\"}"
