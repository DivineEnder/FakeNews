"{\"title\": \"Syria claims it has retaken rebellious village\", \"content\": \"By DIAA HADIDAssociated PressBEIRUTSyrian forces pushed out scores of rebels holed up in a rebellious area near the Mediterranean coast Wednesday and state television said they retook control of the region following eight days of fierce shelling and clashes.The mountainous Haffa region is one of several areas where government forces are battling rebels for control in escalating violence. Recovering it is particularly important to the regime because the town is about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from President Bashar Assad\\u2019s hometown of Kardaha in Latakia province. Latakia is the heartland of the Alawite minority to which Assad and the ruling elite belong, although there is a mix of religious groups there.France said Syria is already in a civil war, echoing a similar statement by U.N. peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous on Tuesday.The new French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told a news conference in Paris: \\u201cIf you can\\u2019t call it a civil war, then there are no words to describe it.\\u201d He added that to stop \\u201cthis civil war from worsening,\\u201d Assad must leave power and Syrian opposition groups must start a new government. He said he will be in personal contact with the opposition inside Syria.Earlier, Syria\\u2019s Foreign Ministry expressed \\u201castonishment\\u201d over Ladsous\\u2019 statement that the country was already in a civil war. The ministry said it lacked objectivity, was \\u201cfar from reality\\u201d and inaccurate.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland warned two days ago that Assad\\u2019s forces could commit massacres in Haffa, drawing condemnation from the Syrian Foreign Ministry which accused the U.S. of \\u201cblatant interference\\u201d in the country\\u2019s internal affairs.State television said regime forces had \\u201ccleansed\\u201d Haffa from \\u201carmed terrorist groups\\u201d and the Foreign Ministry urged U.N. observers to immediately head there.It was not immediately clear whether U.N. observers in Syria would be able to reach Haffa. On Tuesday, an angry crowd hurled rocks and sticks at the observers\\u2019 vehicles as they approached the area, forcing them to turn back. The observers were not hurt. Sausan Ghosheh, a spokeswoman for the observers, said they have been trying to reach Haffa since June 7.Hundreds of rebel fighters were believed to have been holed up there and pulled out overnight after intense fighting in Haffa and nearby villages. The rebel fighters fled the villages of Zanqufa, Dafil and Bakkas under the cover of night, said Rami Abdul-Rahman, director of the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing a network of activists on the ground.On another front, fireballs of orange flames exploded over the central city of Homs, where Syrian forces fired a continuous rain of shells that slammed into the rebel-held neighborhoods of Khaldiyeh, Jouret al-Shayyah and the old city.But even after a week of intense shelling, rebels were still clinging to the area. Footage posted by activists from there showed a city covered in a plume of heavy grey smoke. The intermittent thud of shells was heard, followed by explosions as they slam into buildings.In the nearby town of Deir Baalbah, rebels and troops exchanged fire in residential areas, with rapid snaps of sustained gunfire echoing through the area, according to amateur video that purported to be from the scene.In the rebel-held town of Rastan north of Homs, six youths were killed in shelling, activists said. The circumstances of their death were not immediately clear.Russia\\u2019s foreign minister, meanwhile, rejected the U.S. claim that Moscow was sending attack helicopters to Syria. Sergey Lavrov said during a vist to Iran Wednesday that Russia was completing earlier weapons contracts with Syria exclusively for air defense systems.U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that the shipment \\u201cwill escalate the conflict quite dramatically.\\u201dThe International Committee of the Red Cross said three aid workers suffered minor injuries when an explosion hit their convoy in northern Syria Wednesday. Hicham Hassan, spokesman for the ICRC in Geneva, said the two Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers and one ICRC staff member were traveling from Aleppo to Idlib when the blast hit.It was the first time Red Cross staffers have been injured since the start of the violence in Syria last year.Turkey said it was concerned that the conflict could spill over its borders as the number of Syrian refugees increased to more than 29,000.Activists say some 14,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict so far. Abdul-Rahman said they included 3,400 soldiers.The state news agency, SANA, said \\u201can armed terrorist group\\u201d killed the former head of the Syrian Football Union, Marwan Arafat. SANA said Arafat was attacked as he returned from Jordan to the neighboring southern province of Daraa. It said his wife was critically injured, but offered no other details.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 216061}"
