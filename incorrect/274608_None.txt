"{\"title\": \"Pope Francis: 'The Elderly Are Not Aliens'\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Francis said that this week he would look at problems surrounding elderly people and return to the topic again next week from a more positive perspective.The Pope clearly suggested that contemporary society has largely marginalized the elderly, and that this trend must be reversed. When we are young, he said, \\u201cwe are taught to ignore old age, as if it were a disease to be avoided,\\u201d then as we grow older, especially if we are poor or sick, \\u201cwe experience the shortcomings of a society planned on efficiency, which consequently ignores the elderly.\\u201dAdvances in medicine have lengthened life, he said, but society has not \\u201cbroadened\\u201d to life!As a result, as the number of older people has multiplied, \\u201cour societies are not organized enough to make room for them, with proper respect and concrete consideration for their fragility and their dignity,\\u201d he said.Quoting his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, Francis said that the quality of a society \\u201cis also judged by how it treats elderly people and by the place it gives them in community life.\\u201d Francis added that \\u201cattention to the elderly makes the difference in a civilization.\\u201d\\u201cDoes a civilization pay attention to the elderly?\\u201d he asked. \\u201cIs there a place for the elderly? This civilization will go ahead if it is able to respect the wisdom and insight of the elderly.\\u201d\\u201cIn a civilization in which there is no place for the elderly or they are discarded because they create problems,\\u201d Francis said, \\u201cthis society carries the virus of death.\\u201dFrancis remarked that in the West, scholars have called the present century \\u201cthe century of aging,\\u201d where children grow fewer and the old increase. \\u201cThis imbalance challenges us,\\u201d he said, especially since a culture based on profit \\u201cpresents the old as a burden, as dead weight.\\u201dAccording to this mentality, Francis said, \\u201cnot only do they not produce, but they are a burden besides.\\u201d And the result of thinking this way, Francis said, is that \\u201cthey should be discarded.\\u201d Nobody dares to say this openly, he said, \\u201cbut they do it!\\u201d\\u201cWe are used to discarding people,\\u201d Francis said. \\u201cWe want to remove our growing fear of weakness and vulnerability; but in doing so we increase the elderly\\u2019s anguish over being barely tolerated and abandoned.\\u201dFrancis said that we run the risk of becoming a society that does not allow the elderly to participate, to have their say, because we think that only the young can be useful and can enjoy life. \\u201cThese elders should be rather,\\u201d Francis countered, \\u201cthe reservoir of wisdom of our people, for the whole society.\\u201dThe Pope recalled visiting an old folks home in Buenos Aires and asking the people how often their children and grandchildren came to visit them. \\u201cI remember an old woman saying to me, \\u2018they came for Christmas.\\u2019 We were in August! Eight months without being visited by children, abandoned for eight months! This is called mortal sin, understand?\\u201dIn the tradition of the Church, Francis said, there is a wealth of wisdom rooted in Sacred Scripture that has always supported a culture of closeness to the elderly. \\u201cThe Church cannot and will not go along with a mentality of intolerance, and even less of indifference and contempt towards old age,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe must awaken the collective sense of gratitude, of appreciation, of hospitality, which make the elderly feel like a living part of the community.\\u201d\\u201cThe elderly are not aliens,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey are men and women, fathers and mothers who walked the same road before us.\\u201d They are also men and women from whom we have received a lot, he said. \\u201cWe are the elderly: some sooner, some later, but inevitably nonetheless, even if it doesn\\u2019t seem like it. And if we do not learn to treat the elderly well, that is how we will be treated.\\u201d\\u201cAll of us elderly people are a little fragile,\\u201d Francis said. \\u201cSome, however, are particularly weak, many are alone, and marked by illness.\\u201d How will we treat them? Will we abandon them to their fate? A society without neighborliness, where gratuitousness and affection with no strings attached are disappearing, \\u201cis a perverse society,\\u201d he said.\\u201cThe Church,\\u201d he said, \\u201cfaithful to God\\u2019s Word, cannot tolerate this degeneration. A Christian community in which neighborliness and gratuitousness were no longer considered indispensable, would lose its soul.\\u201d\\u201cWhere there is no honor for the elderly, there is no future for young people,\\u201d he said.Follow Thomas D.
