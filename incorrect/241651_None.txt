"{\"title\": \"Hollywood Playbook: Wednesday's Top 5 News Items\", \"content\": \"The Wall Street Journal reports that Internet/cable providers are attempting to extort more money from Netflix and/or kill off their customer growth by making it increasingly difficult for Netflix consumers to stream:Netflix Inc. subscribers have seen a lot more spinning wheels lately as they wait for videos to load, thanks to a standoff deep in the Internet.The online-video service has been at odds with Verizon Communications Inc. VZ and other broadband providers for months over how much Netflix streaming content they will carry without being paid additional fees.Now the long simmering conflict has heated up and is slowing Netflix, in particular, on Verizon\\u2019s fiber-optic FiOS service, where Netflix says its average prime-time speeds dropped by 14% last month. The slowdown comes as Netflix is rolling out the new season of its Emmy-winning series \\u201cHouse of Cards.\\u201dLet\\u2019s not forget that a whole lot of Internet providers are also bundled cable providers or part of a huge multi-national that is in the bundled cable business. Bundled cable is a racket and cash cow for everyone involved in the business of show and Netflix is an existential threat to all of that. For a long time we were told that Internet providers would start charging their customers for the amount of broadband used \\u2014 a reaction to the increase in Internet usage caused mostly by Netflix Streaming. I never thought that would work. And this latest round of extortion probably won\\u2019t work either. Zero Hedge disagrees, but when my Netflix is crashing or that circle just keeps spinning, I am knee deep in my Internet provider\\u2019s backside. And unlike cable television, there is competition in the Internet business.Meanwhile\\u2026.\\u00a0\\u2018Noah\\u2019 Backlash: Paramount\\u2019s Mad at VarietyFor publishing the results of a survey that showed 98% of respondents are not happy with the way Hollywood portrays biblical stories and themes, Paramount lashed out at Variety for \\u201cimplying\\u201d the survey had anything to do with their tent-pole \\u201cNoah.\\u201d\\u201cThe survey question that had the 98 percent response rate did not contain any reference to the film Noah, despite the fact that the Variety reporting implied that it did,\\u201d the studio said in a statement. Further, \\u201cresearch from industry-leading firms about the upcoming epic paints a very different picture.\\u201dParamount then cited measurements from established Hollywood tracking firms National Research Group and the Barna Group that show strong interest in the Darren Aronofsky film, which hits theaters March 28.Touchy-touchy. The group that did survey pushed back, \\u201cWe sent an email introducing our survey that squarely mentions Noah and that links to an extensive article in The Hollywood Reporter, and 5,000 people responded, which is significant.\\u201dTo be fair to Paramount, the Variety article wasn\\u2019t as specific.\\u00a0 I go back to what I said yesterday: If \\u201cNoah\\u201d does, as rumored, have an over-population theme, it is an anti-Christian film. Period. The devil can disguise himself as Jesus, he is still the devil. The phony over-population crisis is a demonic crusade meant to justify the death cult around abortion. It implies \\u2014 through junk science and arrogance \\u2014 that human life is a burden as opposed to a gift. \\u00a0If Paramount is using \\u201cNoah\\u201d to fool people into believing a crusade against overpopulation is a biblical or Christian theme, that is a wicked, wicked act on their part. \\u00a0\\u2018Gravity\\u2019 Director Blasts Creationists Because Life Came from Outer SpaceJust before he blasts creationists as uncomfortable with scientific facts, \\u201cGravity\\u201d director Alfonso Cuaron told The Daily Beast that life on earth came from outer space:On one hand, there\\u2019s the image of this character who went through a process of rebirth and now she\\u2019s putting her feet back on the ground, taking her first baby steps towards a new life, and in a bigger metaphorical sense, there\\u2019s this comment of evolution. Even more literally, life came from space\\u2013not unlike our character reentering earth and colliding with the water.Tom Cruise, an Operating Thetan, might agree. \\u00a0Perfect Opportunity to Start Your Bluray CollectionFor today only Amazon is offering an extraordinary deal for the \\u201cBest of Warner Bros 50 Film Collection (+UltraViolet Digital Copy).\\u201d Fifty Bluray films for $178.99. \\u2014 less than $3.50 each. \\u00a0Here are the films included.
