"{\"content\": \"Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) inked the deal for his memoir 50 days after his upset victory. Christine O\\u2019Donnell didn\\u2019t even come close to winning her Delaware Senate bid but had a book deal even faster \\u2014 in just 31 days. And Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) set a land-speed record with his contract, landing a book just three weeks after his Tea Party-powered win.Call it premature memorization. There was once a time when a public figure like Richard Nixon or Gen. Colin Powell would compile a record in politics, government or military before telling their life story. To establish their seriousness, a younger figure might have written about a topic of interest or extolled the accomplishments of others in the fashion of John F. Kennedy\\u2019s \\u201cProfiles in Courage.\\u201dNow, youthful pols write about themselves.The age of political celebrity has brought with it a new genre of quickie memoirs, the deals sometimes signed before the swearing in. The books are part-cash grab, part-campaign prop, and partly an effort to answer a question from puzzled voters: Where did this phenom come from?Perhaps the first in the new genre was Barack Obama\\u2019s 2006 \\u201cAudacity of Hope,\\u201d a follow-up to the young politician\\u2019s already published memoir, which sold for an $1.9 million advance just 46 days after he was elected to the Senate.In the five years since, the genre has prospered, with newcomers ranging from genuine rising stars like South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to gadfly-like figures like O\\u2019Donnell cashing in on the phenomenon.\\u201cThere used to be a decent interval,\\u201d said David Rosenthal, the former publisher at Simon & Schuster who now heads his own imprint at Penguin. \\u201cNow it\\u2019s almost as if to say, \\u2018All of the things I couldn\\u2019t tell you during the campaign I put in the book.\\u2019\\u201dThe new class of memoirs has, however, struggled to find a mass audience. Few of the fresh-faced politicians have the kind of life stories and legislative histories that made books like John McCain\\u2019s \\u201cFaith of My Fathers\\u201d top sellers \\u2014 and it\\u2019s been reflected in the sales figures.Brown\\u2019s book had sold a disappointing 15,534 copies as of last week, according to Nielsen Bookscan, which tracks bookstore sales, despite a wave of publicity over his revelation of childhood abuse. Paul\\u2019s has sold just 3,766 books so far by that measure. And despite his frequent presence on cable TV, Harold Ford wasn\\u2019t able to convert his high-profile Senate loss into an appealing book \\u2014 he sold just 8,841 copies, according to Bookscan data provided by an industry source.But those figures don\\u2019t include the bulk purchases \\u2014 often by candidates\\u2019 own committees \\u2014 which can boost sales figures and make the books appealing to publishers despite the lack of public interest.  Brown, for example, revealed this tactic in a letter his campaign attorney sent to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) earlier this year, seeking clarification on what to do about royalties effectively won through campaign contributions.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 112366, \"title\": \"'The Justin Biebers of politics'\"}"
