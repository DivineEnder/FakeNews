"{\"title\": \"Obama's plumbers\", \"content\": \"A couple of fascinating quotes from Jane Mayer's piece on the Obama Administration's pursuit of leakers in general and of a NSA whistleblower, Thomas Drake, in particular:Gabriel Schoenfeld, a conservative political scientist at the Hudson Institute, who, in his book \\u201cNecessary Secrets\\u201d (2010), argues for more stringent protection of classified information, says, \\u201cIronically, Obama has presided over the most draconian crackdown on leaks in our history\\u2014even more so than Nixon.\\u201dAnd:\\u201cBut power is incredibly destructive,\\u201d Drake said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a weird, pathological thing. I also think the intelligence community co\\u00f6pted Obama, because he\\u2019s rather na\\u00efve about national security. He\\u2019s accepted the fear and secrecy.
