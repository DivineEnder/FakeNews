"{\"article_id\": 9949, \"title\": \"RNC releases early excerpts of Wednesday convention speeches\", \"content\": \"The Republican National Committee has released the following excerpts of Wednesday's speeches, as prepared for delivery:***Rick Scott, Florida governor\\u201cI cried with the grieving moms and dads and brothers and sisters of the 49 people slaughtered by an ISIS-inspired terrorist. This war is real. It is here in America. And the next president must destroy this evil. Donald Trump is the man for that job.\\u201d\\u201cToday, America is in terrible, world-record-high debt. Our economy is not growing. Our jobs are going overseas. We have allowed our military to decay, and we project weakness on the international stage. Washington grows while the rest of America struggles. The Democrats have not led us to a crossroads, they have led us to a cliff.\\u201d***Laura Ingraham, radio host\\u201cI\\u2019m a single mother of three adopted children. I\\u2019m here tonight supporting Donald Trump because like most Americans, I refuse to leave them a country that is worse off than the one my parents left me.\\u201d\\u201cDonald Trump understands that we must turn this around and restore respect across all levels of society. Unlike us, Hillary Clinton believes the status quo is just fine because she helped create it.\\u201d***Phil Ruffin, businessman\\u201cI have known Donald Trump as a friend and a business partner for over 20 years. You can\\u2019t be my friend and my business partner for long if you\\u2019re not honest with me and good to your word. I can tell you Donald Trump is both. He\\u2019s been an innovator, an entrepreneur. No one in our business works harder or smarter than he does.\\u201d\\u201cHe is a developer. He is an entrepreneur. He is an innovator. And he is a leader. He now wants to turn around Washington.\\u201d***Pam Bondi, Florida attorney general\\u201cHillary will stack the Supreme Court with liberal justices who will allow government to continue its rampage against our individual rights with utter contempt for our Second Amendment.\\u201cI know Donald, and he will appoint conservative justices who will defend, rather than rewrite, our Constitution. Are you ready to send ISIS a message that we\\u2019re really coming after them? When Donald Trump is president, he will.\\u201d***Eileen Collins, retired astronaut\\u201cNations that lead on the frontier, lead in the world. We need that visionary leadership again: leadership that will inspire the next generation to have that same passion. We need leadership that will challenge every American to ask, \\u2018What\\u2019s next?\\u2019 We need leadership that will make America\\u2019s space program first again. We need leadership that will make America first again.\\u201d***Michelle Van Etten, small business owner:\\u201cSmall business are the backbone of the American economy. We need these entrepreneurs. We live in the land of opportunity. We need to protect the American Dream above all else.\\u201d\\u201cWe need a president who is businessman, not a Hillary-crat. Who understands small businesses are the backbone of America. Who will not raise taxes. Who will repeal Obamacare so small businesses can start offering insurance to their employees again. Who will end common core and protect our children\\u2019s education. Who will encourage creativity and innovation. Who will bring manufacturing back to America. Who will make America great and safe again.\\u201d***Ralph Alvarado, Jr., Kentucky state senator:\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t have the luxuries that other families had, but what my parents did give me was family structure, discipline, support, high personal expectations, love and faith in God. They were Hispanic, they were Americans and they were very proud of being both. \\u2026 But, this story is not unique to my family; it is the story of thousands of legal Latino immigrants who come to America.\\u201d***Dr. Darrell C. Scott, pastor:\\u201cDonald Trump has played for big stakes and is a master negotiator and deal maker. He knows that for all the sharp elbows and words that the art of the deal is bringing people together, to unify, to get to yes. That means solving problems, finding common ground, and moving forward. He has done that for himself for over 30 years. He now wants to take that experience to get the best deal for America and for all Americans. \\u201c***Harold Hamm, entrepreneur\\u201cCritics may say I\\u2019m just a well-to-do supporter of Donald Trump. They don\\u2019t know about the 13th child of sharecroppers who was inspired by Vo-Ag [vocational agriculture] teacher, Jim Hunter. I couldn\\u2019t start school before the first snow or Christmas \\u2013 whichever came first \\u2013 because I was pulling cotton to feed our family. My first memories are picking cotton barefoot.\\u201cI\\u2019m standing here tonight because the American Dream was alive and well when I struck out on my own at 20 years old with nothing but a truck, a co-signed note, and a phone.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1}"
