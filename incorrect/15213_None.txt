"{\"title\": \"How U.S. can back  Mideast reform\", \"source_id\": 1, \"content\": \"Washington was caught unprepared by the unrest in the Arab world. While Arab leaders are trying to clamp down on domestic unrest, it\\u2019s essential to realize that business can\\u2019t continue as usual. The United States is now playing catch-up, reacting to developments. But it needs to get ahead of the curve in the region and help support the moves toward much-needed democratic reforms.President Barack Obama has now called for a meaningful and peaceful transition of power to begin in Cairo right away. Unfortunately, the Obama administration first missed the boat on Egypt, making it difficult to change course in one week.After ignoring the underlying issues for years, it is difficult for Washington to appear reliable to the Middle East unless its new policy is consistent, sustained and views reform as one of the key issues.When Obama came into office, he rejected many of the previous administration\\u2019s policies. President George W. Bush was viewed as seeking to impose reform on the Arab world from the outside. The countries and people of the region justifiably resisted this policy \\u2014 particularly after the war in Iraq and the sudden policy reversal that brought Hamas to power in the Palestinian territories and Muslim Brotherhood candidates into Egypt\\u2019s parliament.So Obama changed course. His new approach placed almost no emphasis on Arab reform \\u2014 giving many in the Middle East the impression that democracy and opening political systems in the region were no longer Washington\\u2019s priorities. This further damaged Washington\\u2019s credibility in the eyes of the Arab public.While change should undeniably come from within, the Obama administration\\u2019s silence has contributed to \\u2014 though not caused \\u2014 the regression in the Arab reform process in recent years. So his opposite approach did not work either.Washington should not impose reform by force \\u2014 engagement \\u00e0 la big brother \\u2014 or opt for total disengagement. Rather, it needs to walk a fine line between these two extremes.There is no reason why the United States can\\u2019t engage Arab countries in a serious dialogue about a gradual, sustained reform process that can lead to a new political opening and enhanced power-sharing. This could help stabilize the Arab world and reduce the likelihood of future crises.In the past, Washington focused on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and other concerns in its relations with Arab countries rather than democratic reform. The strategic thinking seemed to be that if an Arab state like Egypt was moderate on the peace talks, Washington should soft-pedal concerns about that nation\\u2019s democratic progress.But now, any new policy must encompass both issues. What good is an ally that loses popular support? That\\u2019s not going to help the peace process, allay worries about Iran or anything else.\", \"article_id\": 15213}"
