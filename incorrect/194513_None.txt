Hubbard visited the town of Ma\\u2019an, Jordan\\u2013a poor town where residents feel alienated from the government and report many instances of abuse. Some of those residents fly the ISIS flag as a way to antagonize the police. One father of a resident accidentally slain by the police explains that he does so to mourn his son.Others fly the flag to celebrate Sunni Islam in general. The town hosted a small parade last month to celebrate the announcement of ISIS\\u2019s takeover of northern Iraq, something one resident described as being \\u201clike raising the flag of Barcelona or Argentina after they win a soccer match.\\u201d The Sunni residents of Ma\\u2019an were \\u201chappy\\u201d for the Sunni jihadists of ISIS, despite the fact that no official member of ISIS has ever stepped in the town.The town\\u2019s mayor,\\u00a0Majid Sharari, appeared concerned. He told the Times, \\u201cThere is no ISIS here, but there could be because there is oppression, frustration, high prices and unemployment. \\u2026 All that could lead to chaos.\\u201dISIS and its supporters online appear to be acutely aware of the image that is developing of them\\u2013images of helping poor Muslims where others have abandoned them. In one widely distributed Twitter image, supporters of ISIS claim that jihadists are distributing meat to poor children in areas where they have full control:Reports coverage frm #Ninawa on Dawlah distributing meat to poor people in Ramadhan. #IShttp://t.co/5hN1eYM8b9pic.twitter.com/s1qumnxX07\\u2014 Hazimie Nasser (@HazimieNasser) July 8, 2014The group also uses its multimedia outlet, Al Hayat Media, to parade its most exotic members as proof of its international appeal. Among its most prominent hosts is a man named Basti\\u00e1n V\\u00e1squez, a Chilean who converted to Islam and now hosts videos for Al Hayat. Omar al-Shishani, the most prominent military strategist for ISIS, is a Georgian Chechen.ISIS also distributes images of alleged marches in support of the group internationally. Most prominently, images have surfaced that are believed to be of a pro-ISIS march in Indonesia, the world\\u2019s largest Muslim country, though the belief is that it does not have an especially significant ISIS presence:#6 Society\\u2019s expression toward dawlah Islamiyah from #Solo #Central_Java #Indonesia #SIS pic.twitter.com/dqqsldpyAZ\\u2014 ?? ???? #?????

They hear of locals leaving for Syria and fighting jihad, and they watch ISIS videos promising that jihad will bring meaning to their lives. Without a full-scale effort to combat ISIS\\u2019s propaganda, intelligently designed to recruit desperate young men, the potential for a much larger problem for the international community is present.\", \"article_id\": 194513}"
