"{\"title\": \"Chavistas Propose Law to Criminalize Social Media Dissent in Venezuela\", \"content\": \"\\u201cIn Venezuela, things are normal that are severely punished in the United States,\\u201d said the president of the Parliamentary Committee on Media, Julio Ch\\u00e1vez, noting that presidential assassination threats against President Obama are typically met with jail time. The opposition in Venezuela, he claims, \\u201ccan organize protests, order burnings, call for the death of the president.\\u201d Shutting down social media legally, he argues, would put an end to such activity.Ch\\u00e1vez (no relation to former President Hugo Ch\\u00e1vez) has called for a law that targets individuals threatening President Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro with violence on social media\\u2013a law which would have a scope so vague that it would not just target would-be violent actors, but anyone expressing disagreement with the Maduro regime. Opposition leaders have already denounced it as an attempt to regulate the last remaining forum for free speech in the country. \\u201cThis law would do away with, in the best Cuban style, the last little window of liberty of expression that remains in this country,\\u201d said opposition legislator\\u00a0Abelardo D\\u00edaz, who represents the western state of T\\u00e1chira, a state that has been under martial law since February and remains the opposition\\u2019s most prominent stronghold.The call to monitor social media and punish opposition statements there is particularly alarming in light of the Maduro regime\\u2019s other activities against media proprietors. Having accused ousted opposition deputy Mar\\u00eda Corina Machado and United States Ambassador to Colombia Kevin Whitaker of being involved in an elaborate plot to kill him, Maduro has now embroiled the owner of a newspaper often critical of his administration in the plot to kill him, for which the only evidence that has been revealed is a series of emails, the authenticity of which all parties involved have denied.On Monday, Maduro\\u2019s intelligence service, Sebin, called\\u00a0Miguel Henrique Otero, owner of the Venezuelan daily El Nacional\\u00a0to testify in the assassination matter. Otero refused to collaborate, calling the citation \\u201can action against the newspaper\\u201d and noting that he was in Colombia to attend a debate between presidential candidates Juan Manuel Santos and \\u00d3scar Zuluaga and could not, therefore, return to Venezuela for such an occasion. He also noted that the government had acted to limit the impact of the newspaper in the past, refusing to allow for more visas to buy paper for print.\\u00a0A similar situation occurred in May with the nation\\u2019s biggest newspaper, El Universal;\\u00a0the government refused to allow an import of paper to enter the country that was necessary for the newspaper to continue printing.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 195140}"
