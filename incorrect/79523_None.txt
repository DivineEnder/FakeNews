"{\"title\": \"Teachout and Wu disclose finances, an 'academic' book fee\", \"content\": \"ALBANY\\u2014Zephyr Teachout and Andrew Cuomo are both running for governor of New York state and they both have books due out this fall. But while Andrew Cuomo\\u2019s book, All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics and in Life (due out in October) earned him an $188,000 advance last year, Teachout\\u2019s earning from her forthcoming book was more of the nominal variety.Teachout, who is riding around the state on a bus today as part of a three-day \\u201cwhistleblower tour\\u201d told Capital she only got about $1,000 for her book, back in 2008. The book \\u201cCorruption in America,\\u201d is set to be published by Harvard University Press in September 2014.\\\"My advance and Cuomo's advance were very different,\\u201d she said.\\\"Academic press,\\\" added her running mate Tim Wu, a Columbia University Law Professor, laughing.A review of both Teachout and Wu\\u2019s financial disclosure forms, filed last month with the state\\u2019s ethics commission, shows Teachout earns between $100,000 and $250,000 as an assistant law professor and earned between $5,000 and $20,000 from a position as a consultant for the Open Society Foundation.Her filing also showed one real estate asset that was the object of a brief controversy. She owns 33 acres of woods on Bible Hill Road in New Hampshire, which she bought in September of 2011, worth between $20,000 and $60,000. The land became an issue in the Cuomo campaign\\u2019s challenge to her New York residency, and she revealed in a Brooklyn court that she uses the spot for \\u201chang-gliding.\\u201dWu, who has published two well-received books on the Internet (The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires\\u00a0and Who Controls the Internet?\\u00a0) said that his latest book advance was actually bigger than the governor\\u2019s, netting him $200,000.Wu earns some outside income beyond his law professor salary.In the past two years he\\u2019s earned a legal fee from working as counsel with the Internet music sharing service Spotify, worth between $20,000 and $50,000.He\\u2019s also holding investments worth at least $1,000 in Plympton, Inc. a tech startup that publishes serialized fiction for devices like Amazon\\u2019s Kindle e-reader, co-founded in 2011 by former New York Times reporter Jennifer 8 Lee .In 2013 and 2014, he earned modest income from his outside writing, for several prominent publications.His work for the New Yorker earned him between $5,000 and $20,000 in each of the last two years. (He\\u2019s written on issues as varied as \\u201cnet neutrality,\\u201d a term he\\u2019s credited with inventing, and\\u00a0on who reads the news.)He\\u2019s also been contributing to the New York Times\\u2019 T Magazine, earning between $5,000 and $20,000 each year since 2013. His most recent piece is an interview with director Richard Linklater about Linklater's recent film \\u201cBoyhood.\\u201dWu also earned between $1,000 and $5,000 in 2013 and 2014 for writing published by The New Republic.
