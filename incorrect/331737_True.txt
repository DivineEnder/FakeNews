"{\"title\": \"PODCAST: What Travel Can And Can\\u2019t Give A Man\", \"content\": \"My newest podcast discusses the role of modern travel on the development of men. After reviewing how travel is most commonly used, I share the specific benefits travel can offer along with the mistaken ideas of what naive people think travel can accomplish. I discuss seven of my favorite travel rules for men and also take an aside to discuss the growing phenomenon of finding a foreign wife, which is harder than many men think. I close out the podcast by prescribing a strategy of using travel to maximum your strength and potential.\\nListen on Soundcloud or download the MP3:\\n\\nListen on Youtube:\\n\\nSubscribe on iTunes or add the RSS feed to your favorite podcast app. If you like the podcast, please leave a rating and review on iTunes.\\nPrevious Podcast: How To Become More Resilient \\n\", \"source_id\": 17176, \"article_id\": 331737}"
