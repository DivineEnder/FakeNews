"{\"article_id\": 221878, \"content\": \"All polls reflect certain biases\\u2013not necessarily in the political sense\\u2013of pollsters. Taking a small sample and extrapolating it to the overall electorate involves lots of judgement calls that may not provide an accurate picture of the political landscape. While voters should look to sites like RealClearPolitics, which average a basket of recent polls to smooth out aberrations, the occasional \\u201coutlier\\u201d poll, showing results wildly different than other polls, is occasionally correct. It mostly comes down to the choices pollsters make in conducting their poll.If you are reading this, you\\u2019re likely fairly politically aware and understand some basic differences between many polls. You understand that the first step in accessing a poll is looking at what\\u2019s called the \\u201cvoter screen.\\u201d In other words, is the poll of adults, registered voters or likely voters. The difference matters a lot:Both\\u00a0Pew Research\\u00a0and\\u00a0Nate Silver\\u00a0have each looked at the differences for different elections from 2004, 2008 and 2010; and they both came to essentially the same answer:\\u2013 Polling \\u201cadults\\u201d generally favors Democrats by a net of 7%.\\u2013 Polling \\u201cregistered voters\\u201d generally favors Democrats by a net of 4%.\\u2013 Polling \\u201clikely voters\\u201d is always the most accurate.So if you have one poll of \\u201cadults\\u201d which says D53.5-R46.5, another of \\u201cregistered voters\\u201d which shows D52-R48, and another of \\u201clikely voters\\u201d which shows D50-R50,\\u00a0they\\u2019re all saying the same thing. When you factor in the relevant adjustments for each screen,\\u00a0they\\u2019re all showing a tie\\u00a0at somewhere around an exact 50/50 split of those who will actually wind up choosing between Democrats and Republicans.For the life of me, I don\\u2019t understand why media outlets like The Associated Press continue to poll \\u201cadults\\u201d on political issues. Around 20% of adults aren\\u2019t registered to vote. Putting aside the rather large inherent bias toward Democrats, why do we even care to know the political views of those who won\\u2019t be voting? Its about as useful as polling Canadians on their preference of U.S. politicians.\\u00a0With the exception of Rasmussen Reports, however, most media and polling organizations use the registered voter screen until late in the campaign. This is due to the not unreasonable belief that, early in the campaign season, it is difficult to estimate who is most likely to show up at the polls. It won\\u2019t come as a shock to learn that people often lie in polls, claiming they will definitely vote but then, for a variety of reasons, fail to do so. So, as you see polls of registered voters, keep in mind that there is a general bias of +4% for Democrat candidates.\\u00a0But, even polls using a likely voter screen can be misleading. At this point, we need to discuss one of the less talked about and least understood aspects of polling: weighting.\\u00a0When you start from a random sample of voters and begin conducting the actual interviews, it is very likely that the total universe of voters you actually speak with aren\\u2019t representative of the overall populace. You may have too many male, white, low-income, high education or Midwestern voters. Polling firms deal with this by \\u201cweighting\\u201d the sample, essentially tossing certain interviews so that the final results reflect responses from a representative sample that matches the nation\\u2019s demographics.\\u00a0Most of this is fairly technical and, with the exception of the occasional disreputable firm, fairly straightforward. Where it gets very tricky is where polling firms \\u201cweight\\u201d their sample based on their estimate of the partisan breakdown of the electorate. In other words, how many democrats, republicans and independents they include in their sample. This judgement call can throw off even the more accurate\\u00a0likely voter screen.In 2008, an obviously big year for Democrats, the partisan breakdown of the actual electorate was:By ideology, the breakdown was:In 2010, an obviously big year for the GOP, the partisan breakdown of the actual was:By ideology, the breakdown was:So, any poll in 2010 that used 2008 as their baseline, i.e. weighting their polling sample to reflect the partisan breakdown of 2008, would have been wildly off. Remember, the pollster would have \\u201ctossed\\u201d certain interviews to get to the D-39, R-32 and I-29 sample.\\u00a0So, is the electorate in 2012 going to be more like 2008 or 2010? Personally, with an energized GOP and conservative base, I don\\u2019t think the 2012 electorate is going to come remotely close to the partisan breakdown we saw in 2008. But, most pollsters seem to disagree and are weighting their polls for just such an outcome.Organizations like Gallup and The Associated Press make it almost impossible to find out their\\u00a0partisan screen. Newer organizations, though, like Politico, DailyKos and Fox News do make this information available.\\u00a0A recent poll by DailyKos/PPP, which had Obama up by 3 points, had the following partisan screen:So, the DailyKos poll expects a bigger Democrat and liberal turnout than in 2008. Somehow, I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s likely.Politico\\u2018s recent poll, which found Romney with a 1-point lead had the following partisan screen:(Note: I\\u2019ve done my own \\u201cweighting\\u201d and assigned \\u201cleans GOP\\u201d and \\u201cleans Democrat\\u201d to \\u201cIndependents.\\u201d)\\u00a0A recent FoxNews poll, which showed Obama with a 7-point lead had this partisan breakdown:What color is the sky in FoxNews\\u2019 world if they think the Democrats, in 2012, are going to increase their share of the electorate from 2008? When was it, exactly, that a bunch of independents suddenly switched to the Democrat party?\\u00a0I think all of these polls are oversampling Democrats and undersampling Republicans. The nadir for the GOP was 2008, when they only made up 32% of the electorate. In the wake of ObamaCare and a stalled economy, there is no way the GOP is going to sit home like they did when faced with a McCain candidacy. Also, the Democrats were at the high-water mark of the \\u201chope and change\\u201d promise of Obama in 2008, when they made up 39% of the electorate. There is no way they reach that level again.\\u00a0So, every poll you see, dig deep into the partisan breakdown. Your mileage may vary, but you\\u2019d be right to adjust the numbers accordingly.\", \"title\": \"Polling 101: Navigating the Polls in an Election Year\", \"source_id\": 2}"
