"{\"title\": \"When saving energy could save lives\", \"content\": \"Military operations in landlocked Afghanistan are a painful reminder of how much the U.S. military relies on petroleum-based fuels for its tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft \\u2014 even the generators that provide electricity at forward operating bases.It\\u2019s a costly dependence, not just in terms of money but also in blood. About 3,000 U.S. troops and contractors have been killed or wounded protecting overland supply convoys from Taliban attacks. And nearly 80 percent of the convoys carry fuel.The Pentagon this week unveiled its first plan to save money and protect the troops by changing the way forces on the battlefield use energy. The operational energy strategy focuses on operating more efficiently, minimizing dependence on petroleum by using alternate fuels and new technologies such as solar power and cutting the cost of energy consumption, both in dollars and lives. The approach builds on not just the Afghanistan experience but also on growing concerns about the security and availability of the world\\u2019s oil supply.\\u201cThe way we build energy into our operations is a core part of fighting and winning the nation\\u2019s wars,\\u201d Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn said Tuesday in announcing the strategy.Concerns about fuel supply lines are not new. The Navy\\u2019s ballistic missile submarines, for example, have been powered by nuclear energy for more than 50 years, so they can remain undetected beneath the ocean surface for longer periods of time without the need to refuel.But the concerns have become more urgent in recent years because of a rapid increase in the need for petroleum-based fuels, combined with skyrocketing costs and supply disruptions by hostile governments or political instability. The combination of those factors has made energy consumption a strategic vulnerability for the United States.\\u201cOur ability to sustain military operations is increasingly threatened,\\u201d Lynn said. \\u201c[The] DOD needs to address energy needs as a broad military challenge.\\u201dThe numbers are staggering. U.S. military operations consumed 5 billion gallons of fuel last year. Today\\u2019s Army consumes about 15 to 20 gallons of fuel per soldier per day, compared with about one gallon a day since World War II. Much of that is due to the increased use of computers and other electronic equipment on the battlefield.One of the key elements of the strategy is to diversify the sources of electricity with alternatives such as solar power, which has already been tested by Marines under combat in Afghanistan, said Sharon Burke, assistant secretary of defense for operational energy plans and programs.\\u201cFor the long term, the department will take steps to promote the development of alternative fuels for our legacy fleets, and we will do more to protect against a disruption in our supplies, particularly of electricity at fixed installations,\\u201d she said.A former vice president of the Center for a New American Security, Burke took office a year ago as the Pentagon\\u2019s first top energy official. The job was created by Congress in 2009 to address the challenges surrounding energy security.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 107135}"
