"{\"title\": \"Mexican Border Mayor\\u2019s Bodyguards Jailed on Weapons Charges\", \"content\": \"Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas and Coahuila to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\\u00a0Breitbart Texas\\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\\u00a0Spanish. This article was written by \\u201cJ.A. Espinoza\\u201d from Matamoros.\\u00a0Federal authorities arrested Oliverio Mendez Olmos and Hector Alan Sanchez Ramos earlier this week and turned them over to Mexico\\u2019s Attorney General\\u2019s Office on allegations that the bodyguards had restricted weaponry without the necessary licenses and permits.The arrest took place shortly after 10 p.m. when the security detail returned\\u00a0from escorting\\u00a0Matamoros Mayor Leticia Salazar to one of the city\\u2019s international bridges. As Breitbart Texas has previously reported, Salazar has been the target of an assassination attempt and other hostilities in the past. The state government has tried to minimize the attacks against Salazar. Since the Gulf Cartel continues to operate impunity in the major cities in this state, at times Salazar has spent the night in Texas. After the security detail had dropped off Salazar at the bridge, two of the armored SUV\\u2019s drove back but when they passed through an area near the U.S. Consulate, Mexican federal police officers stopped the \\u201csuspicious\\u201d convoy.\\u00a0 Federal authorities stopped the convoy because the two SUV\\u2019s did not have license plates, had dark tinted windows and the only markers were a blue \\u201cM\\u201d that is part of the mayor\\u2019s logo. During the stop by federal cops, both Mendez and Sanchez were not able to provide any ID\\u2019s that identify them as city employees or members of the security detail. The men also did not have permits for the weapons that were found inside the vehicles. The two vehicles ended up at the headquarters of the PGR office from where one was eventually released. Salazar has not made any public statements about the arrest of her\\u00a0two bodyguards.\\n\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 305322}"
