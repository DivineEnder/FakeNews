The events are being co-sponsored by Facebook; the dates have not been determined.Univision's proposition for a forum followed the network's\\u00a0unsuccessful attempt\\u00a0to lobby the Commission on Presidential Debates for another debate, hosted by Ramos and Salinas, that would address the concerns of Latino voters. Instead, both candidates will appear alone and take questions from the anchors and the audience.This isn't quite the same as a debate, and either way it's less risk-free for Obama, with whom some Hispanic voters remain unhappy over a lack of movement on comprehensive immigration reform, but whose move to temporarily halt some deportations earlier this year has improved his numbers.For Romney, who was addressed with some chagrin as relates to Hispanic voters at a fundraiser by Univision head Randy Falco several weeks ago, this is a bigger issue, and it highlights the concern his campaign has about its deficit with Hispanic voters.Maggie Haberman is senior political reporter for Politico.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
