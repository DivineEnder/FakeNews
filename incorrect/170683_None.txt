"{\"title\": \"Breitbart Texas Sponsors National Border Patrol Council\\u2019s \\u2018The Green Line\\u2019 Podcast\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Breitbart Texas announced its sponsorship of a podcast hosted by the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC). The purpose of the podcast, titled \\u201cThe Green Line,\\u201d is to improve communications to its nearly 17,000 non-supervisory Border Patrol agents. Breitbart News Co-Founder, President and CEO Larry Solov, Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby, and reporter Ildefonso Ortiz traveled to Phoenix to meet with the Border Patrol union officials and launch this effort to support the agents who put their lives on the line to protect the sovereignty of this country.NBPC Vice President Shawn Moran and Agent Thane Gallagher welcomed Breitbart Texas to the show by talking about Brandon Darby\\u2019s series of articles from last summer that changed the national dialog on border security. \\u201cFor quite a while, we were having an influx of juveniles through the south Texas area, the Rio Grande Valley,\\u201d Moran began. \\u201cFor those that work there, they know that the only people reporting on it were media outlets from the valley.\\u201d He said agents along the border would tell him they were being overrun and \\u201cnobody knows about it.\\u201d\\u201cI was sitting there talking to CNN and Fox News,\\u201d Moran explained, \\u201cand nobody wanted to do a thing about it.\\u201d Moran contacted Darby and suggested he go down to The Valley and see what was happening with his own eyes. \\u201cHe was one of the first reporters to go down there and really expose what was going on,\\u201d he said about Darby. \\u201cHis stories were really the thing that sparked the interest and it exploded from there. It became one of the biggest stories in the country for about six months.\\u201dMoran announced Breitbart Texas\\u2019 sponsorship of their internet radio podcast. \\u201cIt\\u2019s because of the generosity of Breitbart Texas,\\u201d he explained, \\u201cwe\\u2019ve been able to upgrade the sound of the show and the abilities of the show.\\u201dLarry Solov responded, \\u201cIt\\u2019s us that have gratitude. You guys have a really tough job facing all of the obstacles that you do\\u2026 We\\u2019ve got your back and we want to be supportive in any and all ways that we can.\\u201d\\u201cI\\u2019m not a big fan of unions at all,\\u201d Darby interjected, \\u201cI love this union. If it weren\\u2019t for this union, the American public, the people who still respect law and order and who still respect this nation, would have no information except for the few times that I can leak information from someone. There would be no information.\\u201d\\u201cWithout that public support, you guys would be very alone,\\u201d Darby expressed. \\u201cYou have every force in this country, almost, mobilized against you for political reasons. You have all of the media, almost, mobilized against you \\u2013 your leadership is mobilized against you because most of them are politically appointed by people who I really think don\\u2019t like you and they don\\u2019t like what you do and they want as many people to come in as possible. It\\u2019s unbelievable, the lack of support that you guys get.\\u201dDarby discussed how the media works against Border Patrol agents and distorts the truth. He cited examples of the media downplaying the seriousness of the danger of rocks being thrown at agents. Darby compared the attacks against the Border Patrol agents by left-of-center media to the attacks he personally went through when he exposed the militant activities of left-wing violent activists. \\u201cI know what it feels like to have the media turn on you,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cI worked with the FBI. We worked and we helped stop a bomb plot at the Republican National Convention. When my name came out, the media and everyone turned on me and they demonized the men and women I served with.\\u201dDarby said that when Andrew Breitbart found him under a vicious attack by the media and how the media would bully him when he tried to respond, Andrew gave him a voice and a platform to speak from. \\u201cIt is natural and in the DNA of Breitbart News that we would defend law enforcement agents and officers who were under attack.\\u201dDarby said when he saw the way the media distorted information about Border Patrol agents, he felt an immediate relationship to the agents. \\u201cI know what that feels like,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAt the time Shawn came into my life, that\\u2019s when I really started to understand that it wasn\\u2019t just a media issue against agents, it was actually people in positions of power in the government who were seemingly doing everything in their power to get in your way.\\u201dMoran discussed the work Darby has done along the border in trying to really understand what agents are confronted with. \\u201cHe\\u2019s been out there, trying to get things from our viewpoint,\\u201d Moran told the live audience. \\u201cHe talks to a lot of Border Patrol Agents.\\u201d Moran said Darby has\\u00a0taken an incessant number of trips to the border and has probably walked more of the border than any Border Patrol agent. He said Darby talks to agents and anyone else he runs into along the way.Breitbart Texas recently began a project\\u00a0called \\u201cCartel Chronicles.\\u201d The effort involves Brandon Darby and Ildefonso Ortiz traveling into Mexican border cities that are under the control of the infamous Gulf Cartel. They meet with citizen journalists who clandestinely report and expose organized crime and public corruption in northern Mexico.Moran asked Darby how the project began. Darby responded that Ortiz, Breitbart Texas\\u2019 reporter who focuses on reporting on criminal activities of the various cartels operating in Mexico and the United States, was from Mexico originally and has contacts who were citizen journalists operating secretly in Mexico. Many professional journalists have been killed trying to get out the truth about cartel activities. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a few citizen journalists who actually use Twitter and social media,\\u201d Darby explained, \\u201cto expose these cartels. Some of them have gotten caught and killed for doing it. So we figured the least we could do is bring a voice to those people.\\u201dDarby said his goal was to give them a bigger platform from which to get out their message. \\u201cInstead of them using Twitter and Facebook,\\u201d he stated, \\u201cLet\\u2019s provide them, in English and in Spanish, let\\u2019s provide them an outlet to fully express themselves because they\\u2019re risking their lives.\\u201dDarby and Moran spent the better part of an hour sharing examples of judicial and other governmental interference in the daily activities of Border Patrol agents. They also discussed how the activities of activist groups are attempting to restrict the self-defense capabilities of the agents on the line.Gallagher discussed the lack of follow-up from Border Patrol officials after an agent is killed. \\u201cIn this agency,\\u201d he said, \\u201cif you die tomorrow \\u2013 they move on \\u2014\\u00a0 they forget about you. It\\u2019s our job to make sure that we all remember each other because nobody in D.C. really cares.\\u201d The panel discussed methods of raising money to support and assist families of Border Patrol Agents.The podcast ends with a question and answer period where agents were able to talk directly with the Breitbart Texas team members who were attending their event in Phoenix. One of the agents told Darby \\u201cYou guys are the only ones in media that get us.\\u201d That is not by accident. It is because Brandon Darby and the Breitbart Texas team have made the effort others should make to see what really happens along the border and see it from the perspective of those who we call upon do defend our borders.Bob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.
