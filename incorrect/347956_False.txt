"{\"title\": \"Climate Change Divide Bursts to Forefront in Presidential Campaign\", \"content\": \"{\\\"WASHINGTON \\u2014 During the 2012 race for president, the issue ofclimate changewas nearly invisible. President Obama and his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, almost never spoke about it, and it did not come up during their debates. There was far more talk of increasingoiland gas production than of cutting emissions.\\\",\\\"But this year, asHillary Clintonthrusts climate change to the heart of her campaign, the issue is taking on a prominence it has never before had in a presidential general election.\\\",\\\"In speeches, Mrs. Clinton regularly highlights her plan to combat global warming, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton,praised her at the Democratic National Conventionlast week for putting it at \\u201cthe center\\u201d of her foreign policy.\\\",\\\"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her main rival in the primaries, spoke of the issue forcefully, saying that \\u201cthis election is about climate change.\\u201d The party platform calls for a price \\u2014 essentially a tax \\u2014 on carbon pollution.\\\",\\\"Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s opponent in the November election,Donald J. Trump, has gone further than any other Republican presidential nominee in opposing climate change policy. He often mocks the established science of human-caused climate change and dismisses it as a hoax. The Republican platform calls climate change policy \\u201cthe triumph of extremism over common sense.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The divide between the two parties over the issue is the widest it has been in the decades since it emerged as a public policy matter. That is all the more remarkable given that during the 2008 election, the Democratic and Republican positions on climate change were almost identical.\\\",\\\"That year, Mr. Obama and the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, spoke of the need to address the human causes of global warming, and they proposed a nearly identical policy \\u2014 a \\u201ccap-and-trade\\u201d plan, which would have limited carbon dioxide emissions and created a market for trading pollution credits.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe elevated conversation about climate change in this election is truly historic,\\u201d said Gene Karpinski, the president of theLeague of Conservation Voters, who addressed the Democratic convention on Thursday.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIn 2012, no one asked about it and the candidates didn\\u2019t talk about it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIn 2008, the candidates were in the same place, so no one talked about it. They\\u2019ve never talked about it this much, and the contrast between candidates has never been sharper.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Democratic strategists once sidestepped the issue, seeing any proposal that might raise energy prices as politically risky. But they are now pushing it to the forefront.\\\",\\\"At the convention, organizers played ashort film by James Cameron, the director of blockbusters like \\u201cTitanic,\\u201d on the dangers of climate change. Another convention video montage put a spotlight on Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s role at the 2009 climate change summit meeting in Copenhagen. As part of a wide-ranging climate plan, she has set ambitious goals for producing energy from renewable sources, including by installing a half-billion solar panels by 2020.\\\",\\\"Democratic Senate candidates in swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida are also embracing the issue. They have been emboldened by polls showing that a growing majority of Americans accept the science of climate change and would support candidates of either party who vowed to address the issue.\\\",\\\"AGallup poll in Marchfound that 65 percent of Americans believed that climate change was caused by human activity, an increase of 10 points from a year earlier. The poll found that 38 percent of Republicans believed the same thing, an increase of four points from a year earlier. The poll also found that 76 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 accepted that human activity is behind climate change.\\\",\\\"Some Republican strategists say they are concerned that Mr. Trump\\u2019s views on the issue could push younger voters away from the party for the long term, much as they fear that his immigration policies and remarks about women could alienate Hispanics and female voters.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s important for Republican candidates to talk about the issue intelligently and not be dismissive of climate change,\\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. He worked for the presidential campaign of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and now works for an advocacy group backing Mr. Rubio\\u2019s Senate re-election campaign.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe way you talk about climate change sends a signal to millennials about how sensitive you are to the environment,\\u201d Mr. Ayres said. \\u201cMillennials recently passed baby boomers to become the largest generation, so any party that hopes to own the future politically needs to be attractive to millennials.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As they have on other policy issues this year, some Republican candidates are staking out positions different from Mr. Trump\\u2019s. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, a state where voters tend to favor environmentally friendly candidates, has endorsed Mr. Trump but has broken with her party to vote to uphold the Obama administration\\u2019s climate change regulations. Hercampaign website saysshe is \\u201cworking to combat the effects of climate change.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Still, most Republicans remain strongly opposed to Mr. Obama\\u2019s climate change policies, specifically a set ofEnvironmental Protection Agencyregulations aimed at curbing planet-warming emissions from coal-fired power plants. If enacted, those rules could shut down hundreds of such plants.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump has vowed to rescind Mr. Obama\\u2019s climate change rules, and he has called for more fossil fuel drilling and fewer environmental regulations. He has said he would \\u201ccancel\\u201d the accord reached last year in France that commits nearly every nation to taking action to curbclimate change.\\\",\\\"But party strategists say there is a way for Republicans who may be positioning themselves to run for president in 2020 or 2024, such as Mr. Rubio or the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, to talk about opposing the Obama rules without alienating younger voters.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s important for the next generation of Republicans to show that they get it, and that they\\u2019re not just playing the old orthodoxy,\\u201d said Kevin Sheridan, a Republican strategist who was Mr. Ryan\\u2019s communications director when he ran for vice president with Mr. Romney in 2012.\\\",\\\"Mr. Sheridan and other Republican strategists said it was unclear how Mr. Trump\\u2019s dismissive position on climate change would affect the party\\u2019s future.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAnything that Trump says where he uses rhetoric that something\\u2019s a hoax or crooked \\u2014 no one else in the party gets lumped in with that,\\u201d said Douglas Heye, a Republican strategist who was deputy communications director for Eric Cantor of Virginia, a former House majority leader. \\u201cThat\\u2019s Trump-specific bombastic rhetoric.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 347956}"
