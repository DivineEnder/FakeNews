"{\"article_id\": 91226, \"title\": \"South Carolina's story\", \"content\": \"Often taking a back seat behind Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina\\u2019s voters are known for being deeply conservative and hosting some of the nastier primaries in electoral history. This year was no different, with Republicans attacking Republicans over the fairness of the free-enterprise system, Mitt Romney taking flak for refusing to answer when he\\u2019ll release his tax returns and an ex-wife coming out of the woodwork to accuse the leading candidate in the race\\u2019s final days \\u2014 Newt Gingrich \\u2014 of once wanting an \\u201copen marriage,\\u201d allegations that aren\\u2019t expected to go over well in a religious state.But South Carolina has also been the scene of a Gingrich comeback in the primary\\u2019s final weeks, at least partially based on the former speaker\\u2019s daring debate performances pitting himself against the news media. Gingrich is now leading the final polls before tomorrow\\u2019s \\u201cFirst in the South\\u201d primary that was home for many significant beginnings and endings of the 2012 campaigns.Here\\u2019s are some key dates on South Carolina\\u2019s trail:May 5, 2011 \\u2014 Fox News plays host to the first \\u201cdebate\\u201d of the 2012 race at the Peace Center in downtown Greenville, S.C. Only five 2012 hopefuls attend: Herman Cain, Gary Johnson, Ron Paul, Tim Pawlenty and Rick Santorum. With the death of Osama bin Laden earlier in the week, foreign policy and national security issues dominate the forum. That made sense in a state with seven major military bases and a large veteran population.May 7 \\u2014 Jon Huntsman delivers the commencement address at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. While he won\\u2019t declare his candidacy for more than a month, the speech marks his first major public appearance since stepping down as Obama\\u2019s ambassador to China. He speech foreshadows the bipartisan pitch he\\u2019ll make in his campaign. \\u201cBut in the end, while we might not all be of one party, we are all part of one nation,\\u201d Huntsman said.June 6 \\u2014 The first Public Policy Poll of the state is released, showing Mitt Romney ahead of seven other presidential hopefuls \\u2014 despite being a former Northeastern governor seen as a moderate and finishing fourth in South Carolina\\u2019s 2008 primary. Sarah Palin is in second place with 18 percent. Huntsman finishes at 2 percent.August 9 \\u2014 South Carolina Republican Rep. Tim Scott hosts his first of a series of presidential town hall meetings with Huntsman. Scott represents South Carolina\\u2019s 1st district (which includes Myrtle Beach and Charleston). He\\u2019s a tea-party favorite and the first black Republican elected to Congress from the state. Though he won\\u2019t ultimately endorse a candidate before the South Carolina primary, Scott meets with seven candidates throughout the fall. Of the current field, only Paul did not host a town hall meeting with Scott.August 13 \\u2014 Rick Perry manages to upstage the Des Moines Straw Poll, by officially announcing he\\u2019s getting into the Republican primary race at the RedState conference in Charleston. Perry is considered a South Carolina favorite because of his conservative roots and appeal to evangelicals. He enters at the top of the polls in the state for the first part of September, but drops to the bottom after several poor debate performances as well as Cain\\u2019s rise.Sept. 5 \\u2014 GOP Sen. Jim DeMint \\u2014 whose endorsement as tea-party kingmaker was highly sought by all contenders \\u2014 hosts a Labor Day forum for prospective 2012 candidates and Michele Bachmann, Cain, Gingrich, Paul and Romney attend. DeMint endorsed Romney in 2008, but never made an endorsement in the South Carolina 2012 primary.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
