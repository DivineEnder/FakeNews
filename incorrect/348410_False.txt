"{\"title\": \"Concerns Over Rule Banning Sex Offenders From Playing Pok\\u00e9mon Go\", \"content\": \"{\\\"The list that most sex offenders must sign in order to be granted parole in New York State includes many stipulations, all written in the first person. There are promises to register with local law enforcement, to complete therapy if it is required and to not pick up hitchhikers or visit schools or playgrounds.\\\",\\\"And at the end there is a new entry: no Pok\\u00e9mon Go.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI understand that I shall not download, access, or otherwise engage in any internet-enabled gaming activities to include Pok\\u00e9mon Go,\\u201d it reads.\\\",\\\"The appearance of the popular smartphone game \\u2014 in which players catch Pok\\u00e9mon, digital creatures with names such as Squirtle and Jigglypuff \\u2014 on the gloomy bureaucratic document was not a joke or a prank. It was a serious policy enacted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, this month to protect children who play games over the internet.\\\",\\\"But advocates for civil liberties said they were skeptical of whether the new stipulation, which would apply to about 3,000 paroled sex offenders in the state, was appropriate.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis reads like an office that is picking up on a trendy topic and issuing a policy decision for press, but without there being a lot of consideration of how it would be helpful and possibly harmful to real people out there,\\u201d said Parker Higgins, the director of copyright activism for theElectronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights.\\\",\\\"Erin Beth Harrist, a senior staff attorney with theNew York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement that the gaming restrictions \\u201cappear to have no meaningful public safety benefit and are so vague as to possibly sweep in wholly innocuous behavior.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Pok\\u00e9mon Go takes the form of a treasure hunt, with a digital map on a cellphone leading a player to real locations \\u2014 many of them landmarks \\u2014 to try to collect Pok\\u00e9mon characters. The augmented reality game splices a digital layer onto the physical world: Pok\\u00e9mon appear based on a player\\u2019s physical location, and the cartoon creatures are seen through the phone\\u2019s camera, creating an image that melds the virtual to the real \\u2014 a smiley Bulbasaur near a Central Park fountain, for example.\\\",\\\"But to State Senators Jeffrey D. Klein and Diane J. Savino, both Democrats, it presented \\u201ca virtual road map to our children,\\u201d Mr. Klein said in a news release. In an informal investigation, they looked at 100 addresses of registered sex offenders across New York City and found Pok\\u00e9mon near 57 of them. And they highlighted an instance in Indiana in which a sex offender was reportedly caught playing the game with a 16-year-old.\\\",\\\"Mr. Cuomo, in a statement explaining that the order was inspired by the investigation, said, \\u201cThese actions will provide safeguards\\u201d and \\u201chelp take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s office said that the game\\u2019s \\u201clure\\u201d feature, which allows players to attract more Pok\\u00e9mon to certain locations, \\u201cappears to have the potential to be abused by predators.\\u201d\\\",\\\"JoAnne Page, the president of theFortune Society, a New York-based nonprofit that helps former inmates, described the restrictions as part of a series of laws targeting sex offenders that she said handicapped their ability to lead normal lives while doing little to decrease risk. \\u201cSo what we\\u2019re talking about is a solution to a problem that is not a problem,\\u201d she said.\\\",\\\"Though more than 90 percent of sexual assaults on children are committed by people known to the victims \\u2014 about one in three of those by family members and the rest by others close to them such as friends, babysitters and child care providers, according tostatistics from the Justice Department\\u2014 many restrictions, like the Pok\\u00e9mon one, appear to be aimed at reducing the risk of assaults by strangers, Ms. Page said.\\\",\\\"Still, Alphonso David, the governor\\u2019s chief counsel, said, \\u201cWhat we can\\u2019t do is suggest that a percentage of children \\u2014 even if it\\u2019s a small percentage of children \\u2014 can\\u2019t be protected.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The list of so-called special conditions to which Pok\\u00e9mon Go was added includes prohibitions on parolees owning cameras or cellphones, using the internet or driving anywhere besides work. If parolees, who are subject to unscheduled searches of their home and devices, break any of these provisions, they could end up back in prison. Parole officers can grant dispensation on some of the conditions case by case.\\\",\\\"New York\\u2019s \\u201cE-Stop\\u201d law, firstproposed by Mr. Cuomowhen he was the state\\u2019s attorney general, requires sex offenders to register email addresses and other internet identifiers with the state. That information is then passed on to more than two dozen technology companies, such as Facebook, Apple and Microsoft, effectively barring most of the offenders from using social media. Mr. Cuomowrote to the developer of Pok\\u00e9mon Go, Niantic, asking that the company prevent identified sex offenders from playing the game.\\\",\\\"The game has caused plenty of flare-ups this summer, including anger after Pok\\u00e9monappeared at sensitive landmarkslike Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.\\\",\\\"Drew Fidler, the policy manager atBaltimore Child Abuse Center,wrote to Nianticafter finding one of the game\\u2019s locations near the center. She said she supported provisions like Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s. But just as important, if not more, Ms. Fidler said, was the need for parents to supervise their children with the game and on all social media platforms.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think that the anonymity of apps like Kik, Snapchat, Instagram and Pok\\u00e9mon Go does increase the risk for opportunistic offenders,\\u201d she said.\\\",\\\"Finn Brunton, an assistant professor of media at New York University, described the game as part of a wave of new technology that is breaking down the boundary between real and virtual worlds in unpredictable ways. \\u201cCyberspace \\u2014 you think of it being this other place, but it\\u2019s not that at all anymore,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNow, it\\u2019s the world that surrounds us.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 348410}"
