"{\"content\": \"The piece opens:A crack team of highly skilled warriors, outfitted with the most advanced weapons of the world\\u2019s most powerful military force, storms an enemy compound, firing round after round of ammunition through concrete walls and the skulls of their terrorist adversaries.The good guys have yet to suffer a single casualty until, suddenly, one of its leaders takes a rocket to the chest. The audience cringes, but the bang never comes \\u2014 the rocket clangs to the ground, unexploded, and the battle rages on.The upcoming film \\u201cAct of Valor\\u201d is replete with that kind of action, but\\u00a0there are a few things it doesn\\u2019t have: There are no corrupt officers, no damaged heroes, no queasy doubts about the value of the mission or the virtue of the cause.That\\u2019s because \\u201cAct of Valor\\u201d was born not in Hollywood, but in the Pentagon. It was commissioned by the Navy\\u2019s Special Warfare Command and\\u00a0its success will be measured not in box-office receipts, but in the number of new recruits it attracts to the Navy SEALs.\\u00a0[emphasis added]Zakarin, right after quoting the film\\u2019s producers state their desire to tell the story of SEALs in the modern day, casually labels \\u201cValor\\u201d \\u201cthe U.S. Armed Forces\\u2019 first feature-length recruiting film,\\u201d then goes into the history of how \\u201cunsuspecting audiences have been treated to Pentagon propaganda at the movies.\\u201dAfter the war, while Senator Joseph McCarthy waged a campaign against suspected Communists in Hollywood, the military sought to influence the industry with access to technical advice, weapons, vehicles and troops. The Film Liaison Office, established in 1948, was charged with reviewing scripts by filmmakers who wished to use U.S.-issued guns, tanks and ammunition to ensure that they portrayed the armed forces in a suitably positive light.For nearly two decades, the Pentagon and Hollywood told stories of the Allies\\u2019 glorious victory, with John Wayne and friends taking down the Nazis time and time again. By the late sixties, however, filmmakers\\u2019 love for the military began to sink like boots in the swamp as the horrors of Vietnam were broadcast nightly to homes nationwide.From \\u201cM*A*S*H\\u201d to \\u201cApocalypse Now\\u201d to \\u201cPlatoon,\\u201d heroism was supplanted by harrowing portrayals of hopeless, endless brutality. Soldiers coped with drugs, leaders went mad and the government conspired against its own men. Unsurprisingly, those war films, among the greatest of the past half-century, were produced without assistance from the Pentagon.After establishing cynicism and anti-jingoism as the cardinal virtues of war films, Zakarin then chastises American audiences for the continual flops of \\u201cunflattering\\u201d modern military-themed pictures, which will allow the big, bad Pentagon to snake its tendrils back around Hollywood\\u2019s throat:Unlike their Vietnam-era forerunners, however, most such films have failed to resonate at the box office \\u2014 even \\u201cThe Hurt Locker\\u201d\\u00a0made just $17 million\\u00a0in the United States.With ticket receipts fixed as the north Star guiding Hollywood, those fiscal failures haven\\u2019t gone unnoticed.\\u00a0And if the message taken from those losses is that today\\u2019s audiences prefer big booms to existential treatises on violence in their war films now, it only help increase the Pentagon\\u2019s influence on the industry.Still, public opinion polls matter to the military more than box office numbers, and\\u00a0by 2007, the military realized it had to shift perceptions to up recruiting for the nation\\u2019s two draining, unpopular wars.\\u00a0Bolstered by findings in the\\u00a02006 Quadrennial Defense Review, an internal report that set a goal of increasing Special Operations Forces enlistment by 15 percent, the Navy solicited recruiting video pitches from friendly producers.Depending on how well \\u201cAct of Valor\\u201d does over the next few weeks, we may see left-wing critics use this line of attack to marginalize and belittle the film. You can\\u2019t take a movie seriously if it concludes that our armed forces are populated by honorable men; that\\u2019s propaganda, not\\u00a0art.\\u00a0We can also expect a sudden outbreak of hand-wringing over the social effects of a film\\u2013how many \\u201cunsuspecting\\u201d young men will be drawn to recruiting offices by a positive portrayal of Navy SEALs, which wasn\\u2019t that much of a factor for the critical discussion of Oscarbait about\\u00a0Palestinian suicide bombers.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 251897, \"title\": \"HuffPo Slams 'Act of Valor': Not Anti-Military, Anti-American Enough\"}"
