"{\"title\": \"L.A. Times Hears Racist Dog Whistles from Romney Voters\", \"content\": \"Banks dropped all pretense of logic or fairness in her Sunday piece, claiming that the nation\\u2019s \\u201ckumbaya era\\u201d is over merely because a white man dared run against Barack Obama for the office of President of the United States.Like all these hate-filled screeds that cast any non-Obama voter as a racist, Banks doesn\\u2019t bother trying to actually explain how a nation that elected a black man as President could suddenly revert to pre-civil rights oppression. She just states it straight as if it is obvious fact.This has been the single most disgusting attack against Romney voters and, if Obama loses his bid for reelection, be prepared to see every last left-winger on TV and in the commentariat claim that the only reason Obama lost is because the country is filled with hood-wearing, Jim Crow-loving racists.Banks notes that she and her \\u201creporter\\u201d friends hear from people \\u201con the campaign trail\\u201d who explain to them why they are voting for Romney this time: \\u201cWhen those flag-waving voters are asked what they mean, their take on the president makes it clear: He\\u2019s Kenyan-born, he\\u2019s a closet Muslim, he has European-socialist tendencies.\\u201dBut even those claims, she says, are lies. Romney voters, Banks says, are using Obama\\u2019s failure over the economy, his failures in foreign policy, and his bowing to foreign heads of state as a \\u201cproxy\\u201d to hide their racist hearts.No one is using the N-word these days. The \\u201cforeign\\u201d label is its proxy \\u2014 a signal that Obama is the \\u201cother\\u201d in a nation trying to come to grips with seismic economic changes and unsettling demographic shifts.Banks goes on to use that boring, pervasive idea popular among her fellows that code words explain how racism is as bad in America today as it\\u2019s ever been. She can\\u2019t find any overt racism, of course, so she has to pretend she can read between the lines to find it.Naturally, Banks uses that lie of a poll disgorged from the Associated Press last week to \\u201cprove\\u201d that racism is worse now than ever in America.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 240163}"
