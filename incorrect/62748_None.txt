It was not a good move.\\u201dDecades later, the affable California Republican has moved past snap-button shirts and cowboy boots to chair the House Armed Services Committee, overseeing a more than $600 billion defense budget. But as the annual Pentagon appropriations bill comes to the floor Wednesday, NASCAR and the Earnhardt family are still players in what\\u2019s become a satire on Washington politics and culture and how the military spends its advertising dollars to draw in fresh recruits.It\\u2019s a wildly different world than when the draft guaranteed a steady stream of low-paid, single males without families needing government housing. Indeed, tens of millions of dollars go out each year just to pay for Pentagon sports partnerships to build the military\\u2019s image and draw recruits from the same demographic of 18-to-24-year-olds.These sponsorships run from bass fishing contests to the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a Las Vegas-based martial arts enterprise paid about $1.5 million a year to be a \\u201cwarrior\\u201d partner with the Marines. UFC brings a checkered past of anti-gay, sexist outbursts, but dressed up by the advertising giant JWT, it now stars in stylish videos, pairing cage fight scenes with Marine amphibious landings \\u2014 even Iwo Jima.\\u201cSome fight in the octagon; others fight in all four corners of the earth,\\u201d reads the script. \\u201cSome victories are measured in belts and titles. Some are measured in stars and stripes.\\u201dBut nothing is bigger than NASCAR with its television audience, logo-bearing race cars and proven appeal to rural males. And the big-dollar contracts have caught the eye of Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), a stern former high school teacher who has waged an uphill battle against what she sees as frivolous military spending.The Army and National Guard alone have spent almost $174 million in the past four years to sponsor two NASCAR race teams, including the late Earnhardt\\u2019s son, Dale, better known as Junior. Rep. Bill Young (R-Fla.), a powerhouse on defense matters, never forgets Daytona International Speedway in his home state. And when McCollum took on NASCAR in the annual defense authorization bill this spring, the House Rules Committee \\u2014 controlled by McKeon\\u2019s friend Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) \\u2014 denied her a chance to even offer her amendment.Enter Rep. Jack Kingston, a Georgia Republican from NASCAR\\u2019s backyard.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
