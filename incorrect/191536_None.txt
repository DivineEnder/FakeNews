"{\"title\": \"Daily Gut: God is Ted Turner\", \"content\": \"So, as usual, I was at the gym working my quads when, on the TV in front of me, Ted Turner popped up on his own network, to be interviewed by one of his own employees. The questions posed were relentless, as the interviewer took no prisoners.Na. I kid. It was fluffier than cotton candy made of unicorn farts. But no matter \\u2013 Turner still managed to come off as a first class chucklebum.In the interview he told Poppy Harlow (best damn name in news, by the way), that God may not only be behind the mammoth oil spill, but also the deadly coal mine disasters. Check it out, check it outers:\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2013\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2013And so Turner joins all the other nutbags who see suffering as a soapbox. You\\u2019ve already got Hugo Chavez, Pat Robertson and that crazed mullah from Iran (who blamed women\\u2019s hemlines for earthquakes). All these folks lack that fundamental voice in your head that says, \\u201cwhen people are in pain \\u2013 shut up, rather than pile on.\\u201dBut does Ted really believe these disasters are God\\u2019s punishment? Nope. For Ted, God is not dead. God is Ted.It is He, after all, who doesn\\u2019t like drilling or coal \\u2013 so in effect he\\u2019s saying those disasters are not evidence of God\\u2019s judgmental hand, but Ted\\u2019s. He uses the horrible deaths to say, \\u201csee- I\\u2019m right! Those miners are dead because I\\u2019m right!\\u201d God killed them to prove Ted is really smart!Think about it \\u2013 this is a guy who ridiculed religious believers constantly (only the Christians, of course \\u2013 they don\\u2019t chop off heads). And now, he\\u2019s speaking for God? I doubt it. He\\u2019s just saying \\u201cI told you so,\\u201d without the gloating.But perhaps Turner, is right. And Turner actually is THE message from God. And that message is: \\u201cBehold a mammoth jackass. Why aren\\u2019t you watching Fox News?\\u201dAnd if you disagree with me, you\\u2019re a racist homophobe and it\\u2019s God\\u2019s fault.We\\u2019ve got the delightful Robert Davi, the delectable S.E. Cupp, and the gorgeous Jim Norton!that\\u2019s a lineup.\\u2026.and don\\u2019t forget to order my book, bookorderers!\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 191536}"
