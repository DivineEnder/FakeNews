"{\"article_id\": 216737, \"content\": \"Lord Ahmed is originally from Pakistani Kashmir, a region in which terrorists have pressed Pakistani territorial claims.The bounty was Lord Ahmed\\u2019s response to the U.S. government\\u2019s recent offer of a $10 million reward for the capture of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, founder of the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which carried out the deadly Mumbai attacks of November 2008. Lord Ahmed\\u2019s call for an attack on the U.S. head of state is the first by a Member of Parliament since the War of 1812, the last time the U.S. and Britain were at war.Aside from a serious breach of international protocol, as well as a possible violation of British laws against terror and incitement, Lord Ahmed\\u2019s statements reflect a broader European trend in the appeasement of radical Islam. Rather than discouraging such extremism, appeasement\\u2013through the elevation of self-appointed spokespersons like Lord Ahmed\\u2013has encouraged some Muslims to take even bolder anti-western stances.Whatever the legitimacy (or otherwise) of Pakistani claims in Kashmir, the pursuit of such claims through bloody terrorism and murderous antisemitism ought to be beyond the pale for any politician, in the west or beyond. That support for Lashkar-e-Taiba has come from a member of Britain\\u2019s upper parliamentary chamber is a sign of how deeply extremists have been allowed to infiltrate Europe\\u2019s core democratic institutions. \", \"title\": \"UK Muslim Pol: \\u00c2\\u00a310 Million Bounty for Obama, Bush Capture\", \"source_id\": 2}"
