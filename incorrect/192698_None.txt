The deal was knownas \\u201cone country, two systems,\\u201d meaning that Beijing would pursueCommunism and Socialism, while Hong Kong would retain its democracy,its capitalist system, and its way of life.  Hong Kong was promisedfree elections, but Beijing is pre-determining the 2017 election byallowing only three Beijing-approved candidates to run for office.Separately, Beijing has also been clamping down on the use of theCantonese version of the Chinese language, the native dialect of 50million Chinese people.  In Guangdong province in southern China,Beijing authorities are forbidding Cantonese in any television shows,requiring the Mandarin (Putonghua) version favored by Beijing.  HongKong also speaks Cantonese, and it\\u2019s feared that Beijing will imposesimilar requirements there.  Cantonese and Mandarin are writtenusing the same characters, but are spoken differently.\\nA recent poll of Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong found that 20% of themwould like to leave Hong Kong and emigrate to other countries.  Hugewaves of emigration previously occurred after the Tiananmen Squaremassacre in 1989, and again when Hong Kong sovereignty transferredfrom Britain to China in 1997.Activists in Macau, a former Portuguese colony with similaradministrative status to Hong Kong, are planning to hold their ownpro-democracy referendum, and are watching the Hong Kongdemonstrations closely.Taiwan is also closely watching the demonstrations in Hong Kong,especially the members of the pro-independence Democratic ProgressiveParty (DPP).  Taiwan universities are scheduling lectures and otherforms of support for the pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.  HongKong and Taiwan were closely linked after World War II, whenNationalists fighting Mao Zedong\\u2019s Communist Revolution used Hong Kongas a transit point to escape to Formosa (Taiwan).  AP and AFP and Deutsche-Welle and AFPTurkey has been home to over 1.3 million Syrian refugees since thebeginning of the Syrian conflict in 2011, with 130,000 new refugeesflooding in since Friday.  The tsunami of refugees in the last fewdays has been from border towns and cities where militias from theIslamic State / of Iraq and Syria (IS or ISIS) are going house tohouse, killing people, abducting girls, and enslaving others.  Turkishofficials say that they are prepared for a flood of additionalrefugees in the next few days.  The fear is that ISIS will sendsuicide bombers across the border, along with the refugees.  Sabah (Ankara) and Zaman (Istanbul)According to MEMRI, many Arab writers blame president Barack Obama forthe rise of the Islamic State / of Iraq and Syria (IS or ISIS).  Hereis one column MEMRI quotes:\\n[Arab League Secretary-General] Nabil Al-\\u2018Arabi, because hiscompany [the Arab League] is known to be bankrupt. She won\\u2019t callon [UN Secretary-General] Ban Ki-moon, because he has nothing [tooffer her] but his own tears. She won\\u2019t call on the Iraqi army,since it has already fallen to ISIS and given it the best of itsweapons as a gift. She won\\u2019t call on the Peshmerga, since theirweapons are too meager for this campaign. There is but one element[she can turn to]. She spread her arms and said: \\u2018Where isAmerica? Where is Obama?\\u2019 \\u2026The Yazidi woman is entitled to treat Barack Obama as acriminal. He quickly fled with his soldiers, leaving Iraq in thehands of the spiteful lovers of anonymous corpses andassassinations. He pretended to forget that his own countryinvaded Iraq, and that one of its witless administrators orderedto dismantle the Iraqi army.  He ignored his moralresponsibility. He spared American blood, leaving us [to drown] inlakes of blood.\\u201dMemri\\n Yesterday, I wrote that there\\u2019s ahistorical precedent for the climate change debate, that predictswe\\u2019ll all be underwater in a few decades.  That historical precedentwas the horse manure debate of over a century ago, that predicted thatwe\\u2019d all be under horse manure within a few decades.A couple of web site readers have requested further information.Here\\u2019s a summary:\\nDuring my lifetime, I\\u2019ve seen any number of hysterical environmentdisaster predictions.  My favorite was the prediction in 1970 by farleft-wing Ramparts Magazine that predicted that the oceans werebecoming so polluted that by 1980 they world\\u2019s oceans would be coveredby a layer of algae.  It didn\\u2019t happen.Like the horse manure crisis, the climate change crisis will be solvedby new technologies that today are barely foreseen.  These willinclude things like intelligent computers that will perform cleanuptasks that humans can\\u2019t perform and microbiology technologies thatwill convert excess carbon dioxide back to harmless materials.Thousands of research labs around the world are motivated to identifysuch technologies, because any company finding one will patent it andmake billions of dollars.  No further motivation is needed.
