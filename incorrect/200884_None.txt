"{\"title\": \"Clinton Global Initiative Hatched on Private Plane to Davos\", \"content\": \"Chevy Chase was on the plane with Bill Clinton. So was a former president of Brazil. The founders of Google. A former president of Mexico. And John Cusack.They were all going to Davos, the Swiss resort that holds an annual conclave of the wealthy and powerful. The jet \\u2014 arranged by a Saudi businessman \\u2014 provided a luxurious living-room setting for a rolling discussion: Couldn\\u2019t the big names at Davos be doing more to solve the world\\u2019s big problems?In the background, a Clinton staff member named Doug Band had an idea that would change the ex-president\\u2019s life.\\u201cOnly Bill Clinton could bring a group like this together,\\u201d Band thought.Bill Clinton didn\\u2019t need Davos. He could do this himself.\\u2026At its heart, the Clinton Foundation is an ingenious machine, which can turn something intangible \\u2014 the Clintons\\u2019 global goodwill \\u2014 into something tangible: money.For the Clintons\\u2019 charitable causes. For their aides and allies. And, indirectly, for the Clintons themselves.But today, the very things that made the foundation work for Bill Clinton\\u2019s purposes \\u2014 its mega-dollar donations and its courting of the richest and most powerful interests in the world \\u2014 have proved troublesome for Hillary Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign.As donations have surged, particularly as her bid for the Democratic nomination grew closer, she has been forced to answer for whether those supporters have been not merely giving to a charity but also paying to curry favor with a former secretary of state and a would-be president.\\u2026Every ticket to the [Clinton Global Initiative\\u2019s first] event cost $15,000, in addition to the do-gooder pledge. (Full-time do-gooders, such as activists and nonprofits, got in free.) Many corporations were also encouraged to make separate donations to the foundation. Corporate sponsors who generally paid at least $250,000 were showcased in the conference\\u2019s official literature, and they received invitations to exclusive receptions.From 2004 to 2006 \\u2014 the years before and after Clinton\\u2019s new conclave began \\u2014 his foundation\\u2019s revenue more than doubled, from $58\\u00a0million to $134\\u00a0million.\\u201cThis was the fundraiser of fundraisers for the foundation,\\u201d one foundation insider said. The success of this idea \\u2014 a Clinton-centered \\u201cDavos with a soul\\u201d \\u2014 had tapped a vast new reservoir of money. \\u201cIt\\u2019s so much better than going to a rubber-chicken dinner.\\u201dThe model that would guide the Clinton Foundation \\u2014 and in many ways later come to vex Hillary Clinton\\u2019s campaign \\u2014 was now in place: Woo the world\\u2019s most powerful interests to help the powerless.Read the rest of the story here.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 200884}"
