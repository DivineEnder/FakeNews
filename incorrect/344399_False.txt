It seems it could be his biggest victory on Super Tuesday. Isn\\u2019t Massachusetts one of the most liberal states?By one measure, according toa Gallup studylast year, it\\u2019sthemost liberal state. And those who vote in the state\\u2019s G.O.P. primaries \\u2014 ahigh share of independentsparticipate \\u2014 tend to be moreliberalthan Republican primary voters nationally. But it also means that Mr. Trump\\u2019s more moderate economic and cultural stances, regardingSocial Securityand Planned Parenthood, for example, don\\u2019t really hurt him here.\\\",\\\"And Massachusetts, liberal as it is, has recently elected Republicans in key posts, including governors (Charlie Baker now, Mitt Romney last decade) and a senator (Scott Brown)in a crucial race.\\\",\\\"What does his success in New Hampshire tell us?Voters seem most taken by the way Mr. Trump says things, and thestrongsignalshe sends.\\\",\\\"Inexit pollsfrom nearby New Hampshire, he won 66 percent of the vote among the people who chose \\u201ctells it like it is\\u201d as their most important candidate quality. Chris Christie was far back in second, at 12 percent.\\\",\\\"Anxiety and anger among voters work well for Mr. Trump. And it\\u2019s not as if liberal-leaning areas are immune to the allure of tough talk.\\\",\\\"A reader, DMFraser from Toronto, put it this way:\\\",\\\"(A columnist for The Globe and Mail in Torontowarned Americansof how things could play out.)\\\",\\\"What about religion?Massachusetts is one of the more secular states, and that helps Trump here and in other Northeastern states like New Jersey and Vermont. The only state he has lost, Iowa, had a very large evangelical presence, although he seems to haveturned the cornerwith evangelicals since.\\\",\\\"One of Mr. Trump\\u2019s worst states is Utah, which ranks highest in church attendance, according to a Gallup study last year.Massachusetts ranks fourthfrom the bottom. Fellow New England states Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine make up the bottom four.\\\",\\\"Isn\\u2019t Massachusetts one of the best-educated states? And shouldn\\u2019t that hurt Trump?You would think so. According to polling, it\\u2019s generally true that the more education people have, the less likely they are to support him.\\\",\\\"Or as Mr. Trumpput it last week, \\u201cI love the poorly educated!\\u201d\\\",\\\"In particular, Mr. Trump doesn\\u2019t do as well among people with postgraduate degrees, but most people with postgraduate degrees are Democrats, not Republicans.\\\",\\\"A nationalPew studylast year noted that Democrats lead by 22 points (57 percent to 35 percent) in party identification among adults with postgraduate degrees. This pattern held true in a comparison of the exit pollsin the 2008 Massachusetts primary races: In the Democratic race, 33 percent of voters had done postgraduate study, and in the Republican one, 23 percent had.\\\",\\\"Still, plenty of well-educated, white-collar Republican voters in Massachusetts support Mr. Trump. Perhaps an establishment candidate can close the gap in the final hours, but Marco Rubio and John Kasich are splitting those votes.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump has performed wellamong thosewho are responsive to religious, social and racial intolerance. A progressive state like Massachusetts ought to score high on tolerance. Does that check out?\\\",\\\"According to at leastone measure of tolerance, conducted by The Daily Beast in 2011, Massachusetts hasn\\u2019t done as well asmight be expected, ranking 18th.\\\",\\\"In December, my colleague Nate Cohnwrote thatMr. Trump\\u2019s geographic base of support, which includes a significant part of the Northeast, \\u201cis similar to a map of the tendency toward racism by region, according to measures like the prevalence of Google searches for racial slurs and racist jokes, or scores on implicit association tests.\\u201d\\\",\\\"On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump seemed to be making a direct appeal to those voters when he initiallydeclined to disavowthe support of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan.\\\",\\\"Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEighttweetedon Sunday, \\u201cThe strongest correlate I\\u2019ve found for Trump support is Google searches\\u201d for a racial slur.\\\",\\\"The farther west you go, to the Midwest and beyond, according tothe map, the less likely it is for people to conduct those web searches for racial slurs.\\\",\\\"This is the more speculative, anecdotal part of the program, and readers should feel free to chime in.Culturally, Wisconsin, despite bitter political battles in recent years, and Minnesota pride themselveson niceness.\\\",\\\"In the Daily Beast ranking of most tolerant states, Wisconsin was No. 1, and Minnesota was seventh. Minnesota seems as if it mighthand Mr. Trump a defeaton Tuesday, and Trump\\u2019sleadin Wisconsin is more modest than in other states.\\\",\\\"In an articlein The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in December, Mark Graul, a Republican consultant, said Trump was a caricature of \\u201cEast Coast attitudes and bad behavior\\u201d that grates on \\u201cMidwestern sensibilities.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A brash style was embracedby New Hampshire. How much of neighboring Massachusetts\\u2019 support of Mr. Trump could be based on hard-to-measure cultural sensibilities?\\\",\\\"In a different context, I\\u2019ve written that Times readers from Wisconsin, specifically Packersfans,are the nicestI\\u2019veinteractedwith.\\\",\\\"Football, strangely enough, may play at least a small role in this race.A New York Times articleover the weekend said that David Paleologos, who conducted the recent Suffolk Universitysurvey, \\u201cnoted only half-jokingly that Mr. Trump had been outspoken in his support of the Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, a virtual god here, during the scandal overdeflated footballs, and that may have caught the attention of some voters.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Oh my. Next they\\u2019ll tell us that the footballs the Kennedys tossed around the beach might have been deflated.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
