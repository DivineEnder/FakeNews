"{\"title\": \"The Toothless Visas Viper\", \"content\": \"After a series of successful and unsuccessful jihad attacks across this great nation, on Christmas day the crotch bomber struck, attempting to explode a bomb hidden in his underwear while landing in Detroit on Northwest Flight 253. And so after months of ignoring the jihad against America and pretending that nothing was happening, Barack Obama sprang into action \\u2014 with useless, toothless reform.In the wake of the Christmas Day bomber\\u2019s attempted attack, the US Visas Viper terrorist reporting program criteria have been broadened.The Visas Viper program is used by the Department of State and other national agencies to place on \\u201cwatch lists\\u201d known or suspected international terrorists in unclassified and classified government look out systems such as CLASS (Consular Lookout and Support Systems).So it\\u2019s a good thing that Obama is broadening the criteria for reporting terrorists in this program, isn\\u2019t it? Actually, no. Make no mistake: it is not going to help whatsoever. Obama\\u2019s \\u201ctough\\u201d new criteria don\\u2019t let us filter out potential terrorists using minimal profiling criteria.The vast number of bureaucracies involved already render the \\u201cwatch list\\u201d process a tangled up inter-agency web. And it is simply ridiculous how the Visas Viper system, which is the main system that we use to try to prevent terrorists from obtaining visas, uses such vague and toothless criteria \\u2013 even after Obama\\u2019s \\u201creform.\\u201d How vague and toothless? Under the present system, people who express anti-American sentiments can fly. People who contribute money to identified terror organizations can fly \\u2013 no problem. People who associate with known terrorists, but have done nothing further to support terrorism, can also fly. Even people who claim to be members of a terrorist organization, but have done nothing to further support terrorism can fly.This is insane. Isn\\u2019t membership in a terror organization support of terror?All this is consistent for Barack Obama. He has blamed Gitmo for Islamic expansionism, appearing to believe that if we bow and kowtow to our mortal enemy he will become a friend. Don\\u2019t upset the Nazis, and they will love us!Obama has long ignored the onslaught of jihad attacks in America. Close to 40% of the planned and actual Islamic attacks on America post-9/11 took place in Obama\\u2019s first year.Back in September, in a breathtaking act of audacity, Obama stood at the podium of the UN in New York City talking about what he thought was the greatest threat to Americans and to future generations: global warming. As he spoke, bomb-sniffing dogs were out in force in New York City. Ray Kelly, the New York City police commissioner, was giving a press conference on the situation. A cell of Islamic jihadis targeting New York City was planning to blow up the transit system, as well as sports stadiums and the sites used for Fashion Week. Self-storage lockers in Queens were being searched for bomb-making materials.The president spoke of the global warming hoax like a snake oil salesman. He said that \\u201cwe understand the gravity\\u201d of the threat. \\u201cWe are determined to act. And we will meet our responsibility to future generations.\\u201d He said that a failure to address the threat could lead to an \\u201cirreversible catastrophe.\\u201d Time, he said, is \\u201crunning out,\\u201d but \\u201cwe can reverse\\u201d the problem. \\u201cIf things go business-as-usual, we will not live, we will die,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOur country will not exist.\\u201d He told us that it wouldn\\u2019t be easy, but \\u201cI am here today to say that difficulty is no excuse for complacency. Unease is no excuse for inaction.\\u201d Imagine, he said this while the city was in the throes of jihad terror \\u2013 what would have been the worst attack on New York since 9/11.Yet when Senator Jack Reed said on FOX News Sunday that the Obama administration was better on terrorism than the Bush administration, he wasn\\u2019t joking.Only the left can massacre language, render words meaningless and have their egregious actions left unchallenged.But they will not forever go unchallenged. The jihad will only get worse. And I predict when a Muslim gets one off in a mall or an airport, and limbs are flying and babies are dying, that Tea Partiers and Town Hallers will be joined by counter jihad protests. They will be protesting the Obama administration\\u2019s hopeless inaction and impotence in the face of the jihad against our nation.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 219328}"
