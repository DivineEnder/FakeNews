"{\"title\": \"Is WTO ready for Russian bear?\", \"content\": \"Russia is the only major trading nation that has not yet joined the World Trade Organization \\u2014 even after years of negotiations with the United States and other member states. This could finally change, however, if the Obama administration can resolve long-troublesome concerns.Russia\\u2019s negotiating strategy seems to be to ignore \\u2014 often with impunity \\u2014 WTO rules, but to commit to follow the rules once in the organization. China had a somewhat similar strategy \\u2014 which, regrettably, prolonged its membership negotiations.Yet WTO members must now wonder whether they were too easy on the Chinese \\u2014 who seem determined to test the boundaries of WTO rules in areas such as indigenous innovation. This raises the obvious question: Should the WTO be as accepting today of promises from Moscow as it was of promises from Beijing?Members of Congress \\u2014 28 senators and 83 representatives \\u2014 say no. In two separate letters to the administration last month, they urged U.S. negotiators to press Russia to accept international trade rules and standards before it is allowed to join the WTO.Are member nations better off having Russia in or keeping it out of the WTO? Bringing Russia in makes it subject to WTO dispute settlement should it not fulfill its accession commitments. That means the United States and others could ultimately retaliate if they\\u2019ve suffered injury because of Russia\\u2019s actions \\u2014 or inactions.But WTO dispute settlement often takes several years, so it\\u2019s not an ideal response to blatant rule violations. The better course is to fix problems up front, before membership is granted.In recent years, Russia has abrogated bilateral agreements on meat imports. It also has sought to justify other protectionist import barriers on the basis of bogus health concerns. U.S. poultry and pork exports to Russia have plummeted.Meanwhile, in its efforts to become the principal supplier of natural gas to Western Europe, Russia has implemented heavy-handed measures against neighboring countries. Its protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights are loose at best, with major piracy operations allowed to flourish. Other examples abound.Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recently told Reuters, \\u201cWhy the hell should [the WTO] take us in if we are implementing all the rules?\\u201dThe obvious retort: Why the hell should the WTO take in anyone who is not implementing the rules? Not many organizations grant memberships to applicants who base their candidacy on dubious conduct.Russia seems to assume that, because it is a major global power, it is entitled to WTO membership. But that\\u2019s a fundamental misreading of WTO accession procedures. For more than 60 years, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/WTO membership has been awarded to countries that agreed to abide by the institution\\u2019s rules. The WTO, thankfully, is not the United Nations!There would be shortcomings to keeping Russia out, however, because then its actions in global trade would be unpredictable and subject only to self-discipline.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 104843}"
