"{\"title\": \"Obama Ducks Question on Warrant Requests Denied by FISA Court\", \"content\": \"Charlie Rose: So I hear you saying, I have no problem with what NSA has been doing.Barack Obama: Well, let me \\u2014 let me finish, because I don\\u2019t. So, what happens is that the FBI \\u2014 if, in fact, it now wants to get content; if, in fact, it wants to start tapping that phone \\u2014 it\\u2019s got to go to the FISA court with probable cause and ask for a warrant.That sounds really good, right? It\\u2019s all okay because a court won\\u2019t allow the government to abuse the warrant process and just snoop on our calls willy-nilly. But then Rose asks Obama the only question that matters, which Obama conspicuously ducks:Charlie Rose: But has FISA court turned down any request?Barack Obama: The \\u2014 because \\u2014 the \\u2014 first of all, Charlie, the number of requests are surprisingly small\\u2026 number one. Number two, folks don\\u2019t go with a query unless they\\u2019ve got a pretty good suspicion.Here is the thing: If the FISA court is not turning down warrant requests, it is nothing more than fascist window dressing-a rubber stamp. And this is the likely reason Obama ducked the question:[The FISA court] last rejected a request back in 2009, and that was only one out of 1320. In its entire history, since 1979, the court has rejected a grand total of 11 applications. 11. Out of 33,939 applications. That\\u2019s 0.03%. Not 3%. 0.03% with not a single rejection in over three years. That\\u2019s not careful review. That\\u2019s a rubber stampOne warrant of 1320 turned down by the FISA court. Out of 33,939 requests, the FISA court has only rejected 11. The reason polls show Obama has a growing credibility problem with the American public is because his arrogant, sanctimonious rhetoric has painted him into a corner. He is not who he said he was \\u2014 not even close. When the media was cheerleading his campaign in 2008, we were assured Obama would be different. I guess that what the media meant by different was fewer jobs, a larger deficit, increased surveillance, and more wars. \\u00a0Follow \\u00a0John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 212958}"
