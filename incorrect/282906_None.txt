"{\"title\": \"Monica Lewinsky, Hillary Clinton, Feminists--and Me\", \"content\": \"She writes: \\u201cI don\\u2019t identify myself as a Feminist, capital F. The movement\\u2019s leaders failed in articulating a position that was not essentially anti-woman during the witch hunt of 1998\\u2026it should not have been that hard for them to swoon over the president without attacking and shaming me. Instead they joined the humiliation derby.\\u201d\\u00a0Monica writes that at the time, she \\u201csorely wished for some sign of understanding from the feminist camp\\u2026None came.\\u201d\\u00a0I want Monica to know that one feminist\\u2013myself\\u2013both stood up for her and to other feminist leaders, not just over President Bill Clinton but more recently, over Obama.\\u00a0(Irony of ironies: Many of the feminists whom Lewinsky describes as \\u201cswooning\\u201d over President Clinton and who joined in scapegoating her, also turned on Hillary and campaigned for Obama.)\\u00a0In 1998, I was asked to discuss the Lewinsky affair on CNN and I did so. Try as I might, I could not but say that since Lewinsky is over age, is not claiming sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or rape, that how the President used her might have been an abuse of power and psychologically a form of father-daughter incest\\u2013but it was certainly not a crime. We are looking at what Lewinsky now emphatically describers as \\u201ca consensual relationship.\\u201d I also felt that Lewinsky was being portrayed wrongfully as either a pathetic victim or as a home wrecker.\\u00a0Monica: If anyone was to be blamed it was both President Clinton, (and with women other than yourself), and Kenneth Starr, together with a culture of misogyny that allows powerful men (Democrats and Republicans) their pick of young, fertile and adoring women. There are powerful evolutionary reasons for this\\u2013but civilization has come into being presumably to tame the savage beast within us all. Civilization has not yet succeeded.\\u00a0I want Monica to also know that major feminist leaders tried to warn me against publishing this book. They feared that it would be used against women who had already suffered mightily from negative stereotyping. This is a true point. However, repressing and denying the enormous amount of trashing that dominated our movement, these feminists insisted that \\u201csisterhood\\u201d exists and is \\u201cpowerful.\\u201d\\u00a0Said I: But the truth alone will set us free. It is clear to me that women, like men, internalize sexist values and, in addition, are allowed to compete viciously against other women whom they slander, ostracize, and betray.\\u00a0When I was still challenged, I asked them whether they believed the female guards at Nazi concentration camps or the white women who spit at little African-American children trying to go to school in the South were really all that \\u201ccompassionate\\u201d and \\u201cmoral\\u201d?\\u00a0Some feminists actually tried to stop publication of this book. (That\\u2019s a story for another day). One major feminist leader tried to turn my literary agent against the very book she was representing; that agent has been dead for some years but she revealed this to me. Many feminists and a feminist media turned their back on this book. It became a classic anyway.\\u00a0Deborah Tannen, whom I do not know, gave it a rave review on the front page of the now-defunct Washington Post Book World. Eleven months after publication, the New York Times interviewed me about the subject. And, over the years, feminist after feminist have called me to say: \\u201cWhat you wrote about just happened to me. I get it!;\\u201d or \\u201cYou should have published this sooner.\\u201d\\u00a0Monica: I am as aghast as you are about the bitchy, catty pseudo-feminist confab you describe as having taking place at Le Bernardin on January 30, 1998. Please allow me to assure you that these so-called \\u201csex-positive\\u201d feminists (who are still alive) are still out there blaming conservative right-wingers as the greatest threat to womankind and failing to note the even greater threat posed by fundamentalist Islam. They are not the brainiest light bulbs around.\\u00a0Monica: I do not think you are a \\u201cnarcissistic loony toon\\u201d\\u2013I think you are a hero who, although highly traumatized and outnumbered, refused to \\u201cwear a wire\\u201d to further entrap President Clinton.\\u00a0I am glad you wrote this article. Please call upon me for feminist support anytime.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 282906}"
