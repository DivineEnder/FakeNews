"{\"source_id\": 2, \"title\": \"Blair: Immigration Good for UK, Globalist Vs Populist is the New Politics\", \"article_id\": 300557, \"content\": \"Mr Blair, whose premiership saw hundreds of thousands of migrants pour into Britain, named opposition to globalisation as a threat to politics\\u2019 centre ground.The former Prime Minister praised the process for reducing poverty in poor countries but admitted it\\u00a0causes\\u00a0falling living standards\\u00a0in the West.Interviewed by Politico, Blair said there are \\u201csensible\\u201d anxieties about lack of control over immigration but insisted that large numbers of migrants benefit the UK.The controversial former PM claimed\\u00a0mass migration is \\u201cgood for a country\\u201d as it \\u201cbrings fresh energy\\u201d and \\u201clowers the age of the work force\\u201d.\\u201cAll the evidence here, for example, in Britain, is that migrants, particularly from the rest of Europe, who come here contribute far more in taxes\\u201d, Blair added.On the topic of the US presidential campaign, Blair said many of the issues in focus mirror those in Europe. He lamented that the centre ground in politics is \\u201cunder attack\\u201d from \\u201cpopulism\\u201d and \\u201cinsurgent movements\\u201d from the left and right.As a result of this, Blair noted common ground between the centre-right and centre-left, stating: \\u201cI think the single most important political distinction today is actually between open-minded versus closed-minded, and that\\u2019s why I think this crosses the boundaries of traditional \\u2014 centre-right and centre-left have much more in common with each other right now than the right does with the centre-right, and the left does with the centre-left.\\u201dBlair described this situation as \\u201cthe inevitable political challenges of globalisation\\u201d. He acknowledged that opposition to open borders and free trade will be \\u201cincredibly difficult to deal with\\u201d but that the \\u201crevolution\\u201d must go ahead.The former Prime Minister admitted globalisation hurts living standards in the West but praised the process and his own part in it.\\u201cIf you look at the Millennium Development Goals that were set out by the U.N. in the year 2000, which I was a part of formulating, I mean, OK, they\\u2019ve not all been met, but many of them have been substantially met. But in the developed world, you\\u2019ve then got this flattening of income\\u201d, Blair told Politico.Echoing similar sentiments to former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, Blair remarked: \\u201cthe Donald Trump phenomenon in the U.S. is mirrored completely by the Brexit phenomenon in the U.K.\\u201cIt\\u2019s very similar forces. And what is interesting to me is there are two different groups that come together, who don\\u2019t really agree with each other, but have come together in unity against, if you like, what is perceived as the status quo, or\\u2014and certainly what is a more centre-right or centre-left type of politics.\\u201dResearch increasingly confirms that while globalisation hurts the middle classes, and unskilled workers in the West, the super-rich benefit\\u00a0immensely from it.Economist Branko Milanovi\\u0107 commented that Western elites \\u201chave continually piled up larger and larger gains, all the while socially and mentally separating themselves from fellow citizens.\\u201dBlair\\u2019s claim that migrants pay more in taxes than they take out is highly contentious as households with gross annual income of more than \\u00a335,000 are net contributors to the UK\\u2019s treasury.Migration Watch calculated that EU migrants cost taxpayers \\u00a31 billion in 2014/15 while non-EU migrants strained the country\\u2019s finances by an incredible \\u00a317 billion that year.\"}"
