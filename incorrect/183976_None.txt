"{\"article_id\": 183976, \"title\": \"Land-Grab Lib Dem Peer Caught in Conflict of Interest over Plans to Pave Britain's Fields\", \"content\": \"Lord Taylor of Goss Moor has authored a pamphlet for the think tank Policy Exchange, in which he proposes that local development corporations should be granted the right to confiscate agricultural land and pay compensation at 150 percent the market rate in order to build new \\u201cgarden villages\\u201d of up to 5,000 homes.\\u201cOver one million new homes could be built over the next decade if each of the 353 councils in England built just one garden village of 3,000 new houses,\\u201d his synopsis reads, although in a catastrophic failure of maths\\u00a0he goes on to criticise the previous Labour government for allowing\\u00a0\\u201ca situation where between 1997 and 2007 \\u2013 \\u2018the boom years\\u2019 \\u2013 we built on average just 148,000 new homes a year\\u201d, or\\u00a0nearly 1.5 million homes in a decade.What Lord Taylor does not mention in his pamphlet is his directorship of Mayfield\\u00a0Market\\u00a0Towns\\u00a0Ltd, which recently failed in its bid to build 10,000 houses within the picturesque constituency of Arundel and South Downs, in West Sussex. Nick Herbert, the Member of Parliament for that constituency has blogged on Lord Taylor\\u2019s lobbying attempt.\\u201cMayfield\\u2019s strategy has been to upset two local plans being prepared by Mid Sussex and Horsham District Councils, both of which have rejected the new town and allocated housing elsewhere,\\u201d he writes.The Planning Inspector also rejected the proposals for the town, ruling that \\u201cThe deliverability of the preferred 10,000 dwelling option, with employment development, within two local authority areas without their support, and in the face of strong opposition from two local MPs, parish councils and local people, including land owners, is also an issue of concern.\\u201dHerbert concludes \\u201cSo, unable to persuade two local authorities or the Planning Inspector to back his scheme, and unable to persuade all of the local landowners to agree to sell, Taylor falls back on trying to persuade the Government that compulsory purchase is the way forward. This is what he means by \\u201cempowering localism\\u201d.\\u201dSpeaking to Guido, Herbert added: \\u201cIt stinks more than the manure he wants to concrete over for profit.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2}"
