"{\"article_id\": 337876, \"title\": \"Netanyahu Event Similar to a State of the Union Address, but More Electric\", \"content\": \"{\\\"WASHINGTON \\u2014  It had the trappings of theState of the Union address: a packed and rapt House chamber, suffocating security, lawmakers lining the aisles, a powerful world leader at the microphone \\u2014 and a partisan chasm over the words and the man delivering them.\\\",\\\"The speech by Prime MinisterBenjamin NetanyahuofIsraelin the House chamber on Tuesday morning may have even divided lawmakers more than the annual ritual by the president, which is often quickly forgotten. Rather, some said that Tuesday\\u2019s appearance would be a moment they would long remember.\\\",\\\"Republicans embraced Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s speech as a compelling argument for drawing a strong line against a nuclearIran, while many Democrats condemned it as a polarizing and provocative challenge ofPresident Obama\\u2019s policy delivered in the very seat of American government.\\\",\\\"Foremost among Democratic critics was Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the party leader, who appeared incredulous and furious throughout the speech. As she rose and sat during standing ovations, Ms. Pelosi wore a piqued expression that made it clear she was rising only out of obligation. She occasionally shook her head in disapproval and repeatedly turned to make remarks to her colleagues as Mr. Netanyahu spoke.\\\",\\\"In a statement after Mr. Netanyahu finished, Ms. Pelosi said that his tone left her \\u201cnear tears throughout\\u201d and that she was \\u201csaddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Republicans dismissed such reactions and said the speech underscored the strong ties between the two countries. They said Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s warnings about Iran\\u2019s intent should be heeded.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNo country understands better the threat that a nuclear armed Iran presents than the Israelis,\\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader, said. \\u201cWe appreciate his coming, we were grateful for his advice.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. McConnell and others also said Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s comments reinforced their view that the Obama administration could be outmaneuvered in nuclear talks with a duplicitous negotiating partner. They said the speech had provided new momentum for legislation giving Congress the right to approve any deal.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAny agreement must be accountable, enforceable and verifiable,\\u201d said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of the Republican leadership.\\\",\\\"Regardless of party affiliation, no lawmaker who was a veteran of the usually tame ceremonial speeches delivered to Congress by foreign dignitaries could remember one like Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s, which started out with grace notes before lashing out at efforts by the White House to reach an agreement with Iran and asserting that Israel would act to defend itself.\\\",\\\"The speech was a powerful draw for politicians and for prominent American Jews. There were conservative news media figures such as Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, and Mark Levin, a talk show host. Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate and Republican megadonor, sat a few seats over from Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker in whose 2012 presidential campaign Mr. Adelson invested $100 million. There was the lawyer Alan M. Dershowitz, who sat with Norm Coleman, a former Republican senator from Minnesota.\\\",\\\"Even as they criticized the tone of the speech and faulted Mr. Netanyahu for rejecting an agreement that had not yet been reached, Democrats said they did not think the furor over his appearance would permanently damage the relationship between the two nations.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOur friendship and alliance with Israel is based on decades of trust and working relationships,\\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat.\\\",\\\"Even so, he said he had checked with the Senate historian and determined that never before had so many lawmakers \\u2014 dozens on the Democratic side \\u2014 gone public with plans to boycott a speech.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThat\\u2019s never happened before,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was much more partisan and political than it ever should have been.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Other Democrats were much more outspoken about how damaging and inappropriate the speech was in their eyes, saying the appearance seemed timed to Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s political needs in a coming election in Israel at the cost of undermining the administration\\u2019s talks with Iran at a critical moment.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis is a prime minister who has never seen a war that he did not want our country to fight,\\u201d said Representative Jared Huffman, Democrat of California.\\\",\\\"Trying to show divisions among Democrats on Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s appearance, Republicans circulated comments by Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, taking issue with Ms. Pelosi\\u2019s view.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI disagree with the House Democratic leader, whom I hold in high regard,\\u201d Mr. Sherman said in a statement. \\u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu\\u2019s speech was not condescending.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Other Democrats said they recognized that there were going to be differences in the way members of their party viewed the address.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSome people are going to say it\\u2019s too aggressive, disrespectful, and on and on,\\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. \\u201cI just think basically what we heard is a passionate plea. A very passionate plea. And you know what, I wanted to very much hear the speech and the delivery of the speech, the commitment they have.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But to some of his colleagues, the Republican invitation to the prime minister elevated Mr. Netanyahu into a peer of Mr. Obama at the site many Americans most associate with a presidential address.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe took the place of the president,\\u201d said Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, who did not attend the speech. \\u201cIt was putting him on an equal level with the president of the United States in Washington, D.C., in the Congress. And that was wrong.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
