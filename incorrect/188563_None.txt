"{\"title\": \"'Friends with Benefits': Partial Victory for Conservative Values\", \"content\": \"In many ways \\u201cFriends with Benefits\\u201d is akin to a reboot of \\u201cNo Strings Attached,\\u201d which came out just a few months ago, and that\\u2019s good news for conservative moviegoers.   Like \\u201cNo Stings,\\u201d \\u201cFWB,\\u201d which stars the magnetic Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, ultimately arrives at the conclusion that sexual relationships are apt to get very complicated very quickly and have the tendency to materialize into love.   Or tears.\\n\\n[youtube iJS-wWqVAyk nolink]\\n\\u2014\\u2013However, this rule doesn\\u2019t really apply when it comes to gay men.   A greater percentage of male/male relationships (compared to male/female or female/female) can be purely sexual without any \\u201cstrings attached,\\u201d and, to the filmmakers\\u2019 credit, that nuance is not lost in \\u201cFriends with Benefits.\\u201d   Woody Harrelson, who is very funny as an over-the-top gay character, offers this wisdom.   But the ideas that \\u201cmonogamy is against our nature\\u201d and casual sex comes with negligible emotional and physical baggage\\u2013particularly when there\\u2019s a woman in the equation\\u2013has been roundly rebuked in recent years and Hollywood romantic comedies deserve a lot of the credit.There are even a few jokes that specifically target liberals: Kunis refers to hybrid cars and local/organic/sustainable food as \\u201cbullshit\\u201d on separate occasions and Harrelson says that \\u201cno one wants to fuck Obama\\u201d because his ears are too big.   For years romantic comedies have been a haven for conservative moviegoers because they tend to glorify monogamy as opposed to loveless sex.   But now they\\u2019re also subjecting liberals to the types of barbs right-of-center folk have endured for decades!? Could Hollywood finally be turning a corner?   With the advent of new media, conservatives finally have had a megaphone to complain about these digs that typically only go in one direction (ours).   Maybe it\\u2019s having an effect!Yet, \\u201cFWB\\u201d is merely a partial victory, and that should come as no surprise given the fact that the movie was written and directed by Will Gluck.   Up until this point, Gluck\\u2019s biggest accomplishment has been \\u201cEasy-A,\\u201d the most anti-Christian movie I\\u2019ve seen in recent memory.   Pathological anti-religious h8, affected dialogue heavy on attitude but light on depth, and an extremely high opinion of itself made \\u201cEasy-A\\u201d my most painful movie-going experience of 2010. (On the bright side, it inspired one of my favorite John Nolte blog posts of the year, \\u201cAll Christians are Bad, All Gays are Good, and John Hughes Really Is Dead\\u201c).Gluck managed to slip in one solid anti-God sucker punch this time around, which came fumbling out of left-field in the second act. This is rough transcript of a date scene with Mila Kunis\\u2019s character, Jaime, and Parker, a handsome child oncologist:\\n\\nParker: Well\\u2026 me and God.[Long awkward pause\\u2026]Jaime: You\\u2019re kidding, right?Parker: Yes.   [Chuckles.] But could you imagine if I actually thought that?Jaime: I\\u2019ve dated a lot of assholes who would say something like that.Parker: I work with a lot of those assholes.[Both laugh.]So, if you believe God plays any role in curing disease, you must be an asshole\\u2026   Right\\u2026 This dialogue did not play well with the audience at the sold-out Hollywood screening I attended, but I happened to be sitting with an Atheist friend of mine who was grinning ear to ear.A pattern I\\u2019ve noticed with romantic comedies is that the advertising does not always reflect the values of the movie.   With \\u201cNo Strings Attached,\\u201d the iconic moment of the teaser trailer is Natalie Portman jumping onto Ashton Kutcher\\u2019s back and yelling, \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t we just have sex!?!\\u201d   An interesting quote to highlight considering the movie itself was all but a 90-minute PSA for monogamous relationships.   Same thing goes for the \\u201cFriends with Benefits\\u201d business team, which marketed the flick by waging a campaign to add a \\u201cfriends with benefits\\u201d relationship status to facebook.   I wonder if the genius who came up with this idea had actually seen the movie, which largely dismisses the notion that \\u201cfriends with benefits\\u201d is even possible. The facebook campaign has thus far failed.Values aside, \\u201cFriends with Benefits\\u201d is a good time at the theatre.   Alas, romantic movies with complex characters that capture the subtleties of relationships and life are few and far between, and \\u201cFWB\\u201d certainly isn\\u2019t one of them.   I suppose we can\\u2019t expect an \\u201cAnnie Hall\\u201d or a \\u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\\u201d every decade, much less every year (and 2009\\u2019s \\u201c500 Days of Summer\\u201d may be as close as Hollywood is going to get anytime soon).   No, we live in the age where all leads are super-hip and witty with perfect jobs and apartments but are just-a-little-bit-fucked-up; we\\u2019re in a cinematic era where the supporting cast is primarily made up of goof-balls alternating between chewing-up scenery like a puppy with a fresh bone and offering bumper-sticker wisdom.   And in that sense, \\u201cFriends with Benefits\\u201d is standard Hollywood fare, but it\\u2019s still a lot of fun and it\\u2019s hard to ask for more than that from the rom-com genre.And besides, when it comes to romantic comedies, standard Hollywood fare also implies values to which Big Hollywood readers can generally relate, so why miss out on a rare film made with conservative sensibilities in mind? Especially one starring Mila Kunis.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 188563}"
