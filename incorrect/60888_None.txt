I can now bid for the president\\u2019s time and attention as though I were wildcatting at Teapot Dome, Wyo., or influence-peddling on a level with Mark Hanna?On most days I get emails from the president, his wife or the reelection staff. They offer me the chance to dine with President Barack Obama, \\u201chang\\u201d with the first lady, shoot some hoops at the White House or spend the evening with the first couple at the home of \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d star Sarah Jessica Parker. The email invitation from Carrie Bradshaw had the suggestive subject line: \\u201cMy place.\\u201d At least it didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cMr. Big.\\u201dOn the quiet days, the only offer is a conference call with David Axelrod or dinner with George Clooney.A recent email from Vice President Joe Biden had the subject line: \\u201cLet\\u2019s Grab Some Coffee.\\u201d As at a private school silent auction, I can bid $190 for joe with Joe.The beauty of the Biden offering is that I am not tied to the menu. The vice president reassures me: \\u201cIf you\\u2019re not a coffee drinker, that\\u2019s okay. You can order whatever you want.\\u201dThe first lady has also written to me, suggesting I join \\u201cBarack\\u201d on his bus tour around the Midwest. \\u201cThe girls and I miss Barack when we\\u2019re not on the road with him,\\u201d she added, \\u201cBut I know he\\u2019s looking forward to hanging out with you \\u2014 so I\\u2019ll let you take my seat this time.\\u201d Apparently, \\u201changing\\u201d is a White House preoccupation.She also invited me to the president\\u2019s birthday bash: \\u201cBarack turns 51 next month, and there will be a little celebration at our house in Chicago. We\\u2019d like to give grass-roots supporters an opportunity to join in the fun. You guys deserve it, and I know Barack would personally love to see you there.\\u201d When I didn\\u2019t respond, Biden invited me. They don\\u2019t give up.I started receiving email messages from the president once he entered the White House. They brought me up to date on affairs of state. These bulletins seemed at first like an attempt at online democracy \\u2014 a megabyte agora.
