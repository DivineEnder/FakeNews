When a sinking ship like CNN reaches out to a tired, obnoxious leftist like Donny Deutsch (formerly of MSNBC) for rescue, you know the swirl is only getting closer to the drain. Deutsch was such a ratings disaster, his show was cancelled after only one week. How could a smart guy like Jeff Zucker not know Deutsch would crash and burn? I don\\u2019t know anyone who couldn\\u2019t have predicted that \\u2026 except the guy in charge of CNN. Once upon a time, CNN was a go-to network for serious news. But now it is a network littered with anchors just as unappealing as Deutsch, who have turned the \\u201cmost trusted name in news\\u201d into a national joke. How else to explain how the hyperbolic, intellectually-challenged, hard-core left-winger known as Piers Morgan becoming the face of the network? And according to a full-page ad Zucker took out in the New York Times yesterday, that is not going to change. In fact, it \\u00a0is only going to get worse\\u2026Tuesday morning Carol Costello (yet-another unappealing left-wing CNN anchor) announced that Wednesday will be something akin to \\u201cBackground Check Day\\u201d on the network. \\u00a0In other words, CNN will spend a full day doing the Obama Administration\\u2019s bidding on gun control \\u2014 an issue poll after poll shows the American people do not consider a priority. The entire network is becoming The Piers Morgan Channel. If CNN is actually interested in ratings, why not cover the issues polls show Americans are most concerned with \\u2014 like jobs, the economy, the jump in poverty, and the deficit?That is a rhetorical question. It is becoming increasingly obvious that CNN is not going to cover any story that might offend the New York Times\\u2019 crowd Zucker is so desperate to impress with full page ads. \\u00a0But if Zucker thinks CNN can out-MSNBC MSNBC \\u2014 especially with MSNBC cast-offs like Deutsch \\u2014 his reign was over before it began. \\u00a0\\u00a0Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC\\u00a0\", \"article_id\": 139386}"
