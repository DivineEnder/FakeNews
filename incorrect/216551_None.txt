Four innocent men were murdered that day, including my 33-year-old father, Frank Connor.\\u00a0 Our father had been very excited to get home from work that night to celebrate my brother\\u2019s and my recent 11th and 9th birthdays with his young family. Instead, after my father\\u2019s funeral, mourners shared a dinner in our home that was meant for our birthday celebration.Members of the FALN\\u00a0threatened Judge Thomas McMillen\\u2019s life during their Chicago trial. Carmen Valentine told the judge, \\u201cYou are lucky that we cannot take you right now,\\u201d and called the judge a terrorist. Dylcia Pagan warned the courtroom: \\u201cAll of you, I would advise you to watch your backs.\\u201d And Ida Rodriguez told the judge, \\u201cYou say we have no remorse. You\\u2019re right. \\u2026 Your jails and your long sentences will not frighten us.\\u201d These terrorists convinced McMillen that they would continue being terrorists \\u201cas long as you live. If there was a death penalty, I\\u2019d impose the penalty on you without hesitation.\\u201dIndeed, after 18 years in prison, FALN member\\u00a0Ricardo Jimenez explained to Tim Russert on Meet the Press, just days after his\\u00a0September 10, 1999 release, that people died at Fraunces Tavern because \\u201cmeasures were not taken that were necessary by the people who owned those establishments.\\u201d As I watched this surreal interview I thought, \\u201cMy father was eating lunch in a crowded restaurant in New York City. What precautions should the owners have taken?\\u201dIn 2011, I led a group of family members and a Fraunces\\u00a0survivor to FALN leader Oscar Lopez\\u2019s parole hearing in the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.\\u00a0 Lopez was one of the two who\\u00a0turned down the Clinton release in 1999 and remained as unrepentant, if not more pathetic, in 2011 as he was as a young revolutionary (and self proclaimed community organizer from Chicago)\\u00a0in the 1970s.\\u00a0These are the people the Departments of State and Justice unleashed on the American people!So to the Obama Administration, the War on Terror is over because it suits their current political needs, as it did the Clintons and Holder\\u00a0in 1999.\\u00a0\\u00a0As I said in testifying at Eric Holder\\u2019s AG\\u00a0senate\\u00a0confirmation hearing in 2009, he and the Clintons played Russian Roulette with the American people by releasing\\u00a0 sworn terrorists into the population.\\u00a0 Unfortunately, I was proven\\u00a0prophetic by Holder\\u2019s next game of Russian Roulette, Operation Fast\\u00a0& Furious, which resulted in hundreds\\u00a0dead, including heroic\\u00a0Border Agent Brian Terry.We warned during the 1999 Congressional investigation into the pardons that the release of unrepentant terrorists would only embolden terrorists to strike us again.\\u00a0 Never did we think it would happen to our family again.Incredibly, almost two years to the day from their release, the savage attacks of 9/11 occured.\\u00a0 My father\\u2019s god son and nephew, my closest cousin,\\u00a0Steve Schlag, was one of 3,000 innocent souls murdered as I and so many others watched helplessly from our downtown offices only blocks from the World Trade Center and Fraunces Tavern.\\u00a0For Holder,\\u00a0the Clintons, and now Obama, terrorism is a tool to\\u00a0be\\u00a0used for\\u00a0political gain; families, victims, and the citizenry be damned.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
