People everywhere have lost faith in politics, and rightly so. Something different needs to happen.\\u201d\\u201cI think we were all initially swept along with the Obama win, but he\\u2019s proven to be simply a set of teeth, and useless in every other regard. Time and time again we see the same scenario whereby political figures only see the public as electorate, and once anyone is elected they appear to hate the people. British politics, as the world knows, is a joke. Yet it\\u2019s rarely funny,\\u201d he added.Morrissey also told JUICE he believes \\u201call world leaders are dictatorships, and from what we\\u2019ve seen in the Middle East, they will all not hesitate to turn the tanks onto their own people should anyone question their morality. It\\u2019s fascinating.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 65692}"
