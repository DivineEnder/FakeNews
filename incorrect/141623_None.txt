"{\"title\": \"Syrian Man Shares Story of Daughter's Shooting as Family Fled Homs, Syria\", \"content\": \"As they left, he saw his daughter Sara slumped over and caked in blood.\\u201cImmediately I knew Sara had been shot,\\u201d he described. \\u201cI was awake, but I couldn\\u2019t understand the situation. I was present, but I wasn\\u2019t there. It was as if I was in a different world. I turned to Sara. Her left hand and her left leg stopped moving, she couldn\\u2019t feel them.\\u201dThey found a hospital and received treatment.\\u201cWhen they cleaned between the skin and the skull they left a few small parts of the bullet behind,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cWhen she woke up, she asked me, \\u2018What would you have done without me? If I\\u2019m gone, what would you do without me?\\u2019 Thank god she didn\\u2019t die.\\u201dSam Tarling/OxfamThe family made it to the Zaatari camp in Jordan where almost 80,000 Syrian refugees live. The World Food Programme offered 168 Jordanian Dinars ($236.94) a month for food and clothing. But now the aid totals 69.93 dinars ($98.62). Mohammed tries to find as much work as possible, even though the camps do not allow jobs. If he is caught working, his family could lose their spot or be shipped back to Syria. Europe is on his mind as a possible relocation so he can provide more for his family of seven.Sam Tarling/Oxfam\\u201cWe have one life and one death,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve faced death several times. I\\u2019ve nearly been shot three times and I\\u2019ve seen people killed in front of me. By now I should be dead. I\\u2019m willing to take the risk and face the danger of traveling to Europe if it will help my children have a better life.\\u201dHe added: \\u201cI know there\\u2019s no place that you can have 100 per cent human rights but, at the same time, sometimes in Europe it can be better. Of course I would still feel Syrian, Syria is my country and my kids should feel the same. For me, I try to forget about Syria. I left my life there. Even my kids, they left their childhood there.\\u201dThey will feel like Syrians but there\\u2019s no future for them there now. It\\u2019s not only the buildings tumbling down, it\\u2019s everything, even the human beings. I haven\\u2019t see wars, I haven\\u2019t seen conflict like my kids have, so you can expect what kind of future they will have.What I hope or expect from Europe is that there they will have a better financial situation and the UN agencies would give us more help there, even the governments themselves, they would help us. My kids can learn and work and they can get food, anything that they need.On Tuesday, the United Nations asked Jordan to accept 12,000 more refugees stranded at the border.\\u201cIt includes elderly people, it includes people who are sick and wounded, it includes children, women and others who are vulnerable and really need help,\\u201d explained UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokeswoman Melissa Fleming. \\u201cWe\\u2019re concerned that women have had to give birth at the berm in very unsanitary and unhygienic conditions.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 141623}"
