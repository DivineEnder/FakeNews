"{\"title\": \"Kasich: Hillary Using Demagoguery to Divide Americans\", \"content\": \"Friday on Fox News Channel\\u2019s \\u201cAmerica\\u2019s Newsroom,\\u201d Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) reacted to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accusing Republicans of intentionally attempting to disenfranchise voter based on race, age and poverty level and said Clinton was attempting to \\u201cdivide Americans and use demagoguery.\\u201dWhen asked about Clinton backing an effect to sue Ohio over voting practices, Kasich said, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s demagoguery. If she wants to sue somebody, let them sue new york. they have 27 days of voting. in New York the only voting that occurs is on election day? What is she talking about? I like Hillary but the idea that we are going to divide Americans and use demagoguery, I don\\u2019t like it. I haven\\u2019t said a word about Hillary but to come into the state of Ohio saying we are suppressing the vote when New York has only one election day and we have 27, come on, that\\u2019s silliness.\\u201d\\u201cDon\\u2019t be running around the country dividing Americans,\\u201d Kaisch continued. \\u201cDon\\u2019t come in and say we are deliberately trying to keep people from voting when her own state has less opportunity for voting and she is going to sue my state? That\\u2019s just silly.\\u201d\\u201cIn Ohio we have 28 days. In New York where she is from they have one day,\\u201d he added. \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you take care of business at home before you run around the country using these kind of demagogic statements that we don\\u2019t want people to vote Its ridiculous. Come on?\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 200849}"
