"{\"title\": \"Michigan Governor Tells Congress He Was Misled on Flint Water\", \"content\": \"{\\\"WASHINGTON \\u2014  Time and again, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan acknowledged in a tense congressional hearing Thursday that he had been aware of complaints about the drinking water in Flint, including from news reports his aides had emailed him. Yet he had accepted assurances, he said, that the problems were not severe.\\\",\\\"Democrats listening to his testimony were dubious. \\u201cGovernor Snyder, plausible deniability only works when it\\u2019s plausible,\\u201d said Representative Matt Cartwright, Democrat of Pennsylvania. \\u201cYou were not in a medically induced coma for a year.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The rebuke was one of the more caustic in an extraordinary turn on Capitol Hill: A sitting Republican governor appearing before a Republican-led congressional panel, answering wave after wave of questions about his administration\\u2019s role in the Flint water crisis \\u2014 \\u201cthe most glaring failure of government sinceHurricane Katrina,\\u201d as Representative Brendan Boyle, another Pennsylvania Democrat, described it.\\\",\\\"Gina McCarthy, the administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency, also came under fire, pressured by Republicans to accept responsibility for the lead contamination of Flint\\u2019s water supply and sometimes shouted down as she deflected blame onto the State of Michigan.\\\",\\\"Both officials were repeatedly called on to resign, with Mr. Boyle saying it was Mr. Snyder\\u2019s \\u201cmoral responsibility.\\u201d Over and over, Ms. McCarthy was admonished, \\u201cYou just don\\u2019t get it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In addition to the hearing, there are a series of investigations \\u2014 criminal and administrative \\u2014 into how the water supply for a city of nearly 100,000 people became tainted with lead, a crisis that was not acknowledged for months. But in a strange political reversal, Republicans who usually champion local rule cast most of their blame on the E.P.A., saying the federal agency bore at least as much responsibility as the state for keeping Flint\\u2019s residents safe.\\\",\\\"Democrats who champion the role of the federal government blamed the Snyder administration, and focused on the questions: What did Mr. Snyder know and when did he know it?\\\",\\\"\\u201cI kick myself every day,\\u201d Mr. Snyder said repeatedly as he testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, saying his mistake was trusting employees \\u2014 \\u201ccareer bureaucrats, \\u201d he dryly called them, and \\u201cso-called experts\\u201d \\u2014 who consistently misinformed him that the city\\u2019s water was safe.\\\",\\\"The water contamination in Flint and the failings of government officials at all levels have cast a spotlight on water safety around the country and the problems that come with aging lead pipes. The state\\u2019s response has also become an issue in the presidential campaign, with Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton calling on Mr. Snyder to step down.\\\",\\\"Mr. Snyder said at the hearing, as he has before, that he did not learn that Flint\\u2019s water had dangerous levels of lead until Oct. 1, after a local pediatrician went public with findings that the number of children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had risen alarmingly since the city changed its water supply the previous year. And he repeated that he did not learn about a spike in Legionnaires\\u2019 disease in the Flint area until January, even though some county and state officials knew of it much earlier.\\\",\\\"Mr. Snyder also took shots at the E.P.A., which learned in April 2015 \\u2014 a year after Flint switched to a new water source, the Flint River \\u2014 that the city was not adding a chemical that would prevent its pipes from corroding and leaching lead.\\\",\\\"He pointed to emails suggesting that E.P.A. employees in the regional office in charge of Michigan were complicit with employees of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality in keeping concerns about lead and lack of corrosion control quiet for months.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey were in regular dialogue,\\u201d he said of federal and state environmental officials. \\u201cWe needed urgency, we needed action,\\u201d but they kept on talking, he said.\\\",\\\"Republicans have long targeted the E.P.A. as a source of government incompetence and overreach. Ms. McCarthy, conceded that her agency had not responded quickly or forcefully enough when it learned that Flint had not taken the necessary corrosion control steps. But she said the E.P.A. had been fooled and foiled by the same state employees who misled Mr. Snyder.\\\",\\\"Much to the vexation of Republicans on the panel, she repeatedly refused to say the E.P.A. had failed, or that anyone in the agency should have been fired \\u2014 including the regional administrator overseeing Michigan, Susan Hedman, who later quit after questions were raised about the handling of a whistle-blower, Miguel Del Toral, whose warnings about lead were not acted aggressively on and who later complained that he was punished for his actions.\\\",\\\"She also refused to say whether the outcome would have been different if the federal law setting standards for safe drinking water had been clearer.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI wish we had gone farther, I wish we had yelled from the treetops,\\u201d Ms. McCarthy told the committee. \\u201cBut there is no way my agency created this problem.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Few new facts emerged from the four-hour hearing, nor did any minds appear to be changed about culpability. Perhaps most striking was that despite the partisan tone, Republicans sprinkled at least some criticism on Mr. Snyder, while Democrats chastised the E.P.A. for not responding more forcefully when it learned Flint had not added corrosion controls after switching to the river water.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe state has a big part of this blame, I\\u2019m not trying to excuse them whatsoever,\\u201d said Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who is the chairman of the committee, although he spent most of his allotted time trying to force an unyielding Ms. McCarthy to acknowledge she had \\u201cscrewed up.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Flint residents who attended the hearing \\u2014 many of whom had traveled overnight by bus to get there \\u2014 left shrugging their shoulders, unsure what to take from it.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t start off with a lot of high hopes,\\u201d said Melissa Mays, a resident who is a lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit against the Snyder administration. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a little more fire for everybody back home, because for the longest time we felt like we didn\\u2019t have a voice, we didn\\u2019t matter, nobody cared. And now we\\u2019re watching people care about what\\u2019s been happening.\\u201d\\\",\\\"After the hearing, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, said he remained determined to interview 15 current and former members of the Snyder administration who had so far rejected his invitation to do so. In particular, Mr. Cummings said he wished to speak with Dennis Muchmore, Mr. Snyder\\u2019s former chief of staff, who raised regular alarms about Flint\\u2019s water problems last year in emails released by the governor\\u2019s office.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t end here,\\u201d said Mr. Cummings, who was among those calling for Mr. Snyder\\u2019s resignation at the hearing.\\\",\\\"Mr. Chaffetz deflected reporters\\u2019 questions about whether he would use his subpoena power to bring Mr. Muchmore before the committee.\\\",\\\"The day brought other headaches for Mr. Snyder: Standard &amp; Poor\\u2019s lowered the outlook on Michigan\\u2019s credit rating to stable from positive, citing the costs of dealing with the Flint crisis, and also with a looming financial crisis affecting Detroit public schools.\\\",\\\"At the hearing, Democrats frequently made reference to Flint children who have been exposed to lead in their drinking water, and in one of the final exchanges of the hearing, Mr. Cummings asked Mr. Snyder what those children were supposed to learn from the government failures.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s one of the terrible parts of all of this,\\u201d Mr. Snyder replied. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a question of trust in government, and there\\u2019s good reason for them to ask that question. And that\\u2019s going to take a huge amount of time to earn back, if it can be earned back.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 344855}"
