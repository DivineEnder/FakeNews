"{\"title\": \"'There Are Only Muslims And Communists'\", \"content\": \"Our Czech correspondent Gemini sends his translation of sections from two articles in the Czech media. These stories concern a plain-spoken Czech politician whose candor is refreshing, to say the least, for those of us who live to the west of the old Iron Curtain.Below is Gemini\\u2019s introduction:\\n\\nIn recent days the Czech mainstream media have brought to light statements from Milo\\u0161 Zeman, a prominent leftist politician, regarding Islam. This former prime minister of the Czech Republic (1998 \\u2013 2002), also at one time a presidential candidate, is well-known for his open statements and uncompromising humour. Most of these statements were taken from his report presented at the international conference entitled \\u201cEurope united and free?\\u201d, held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic and country\\u2019s Defence Ministry. The rest come from a subsequent press release. These statements have already led to charges against the aforementioned politician.The original sources, including a few more short commentaries, may be found here and here, while this article concentrates mostly on Zeman\\u2019s statements.His condensed translation:\\n\\nWith his mention of drugs, he was mostly referring to Afghanistan and Kosovo. With the former NATO became mired in an endless war, while the latter got help from the alliance to secede from Serbia. This involvement he regards as a failure.\\u201cI don\\u2019t believe there are Muslims and radical Muslims. Just as I don\\u2019t believe there are moderate and radical communists. There are only Muslims and communists,\\u201d Zeman addressed the conference participants.He believes that one of the mistakes the West has been making is its willingness to negotiate and its responsiveness towards Muslim countries.\\u201cJust remember the appeasement politics during the \\u201930s. The victims were thrown directly into enemy\\u2019s guts, and (see) where it ended. The 21st century is not going to be Fukuyama\\u2019s \\u2018End of History\\u2019, but Huntington\\u2019s \\u2018Clash of Civilizations\\u2019,\\u201d predicted the retired Zeman.If NATO should expand in the future, it must be Israel that is adopted, according to Zeman. \\u201cNot the state whose president regards Stalin and Beria his main heroes,\\u201d he declared, referring to Georgia as governed by Mikhail Saakashvili. However, this could not be so easily done without changing the political climate in the NATO countries. And this is exactly what the politicians are afraid of, Zeman believes.Nor was the EU spared. \\u201cThe EU reminds me of an overweight kid who is starting to throw up,\\u201d summed up Zeman about the union of states, some of which have already asked for huge financial support.\\u201cEven if one might agree that women should not be allowed to drive a car, in every other aspect the Islamic anti-civilisation makes women into a subjugated and second-class minority,\\u201d he added in a separate press release.\\u201cThere is no doubt that Islam\\u2019s ideological basis is the Koran. A Muslim can be identified as an adherent of Koran, just as Nazi is an adherent of racial supremacy and anti-Semitism, or a Communist an adherent of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship,\\u201d he further elaborated in his press release.\\u201cIslam is incomparably more aggressive and intolerant that today\\u2019s Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism, Shintoism and other world religions,\\u201d added the former presidential candidate, referring to Koran.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 265571}"
