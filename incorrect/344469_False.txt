Before the second debate began,he walked.\\\",\\\"But on Thursday night,Donald J. Trumpand Megyn Kelly will be back on stage together for the 11thRepublican presidential debate, and Fox\\u2019s third of the primary season.\\\",\\\"As the front-runner for the nomination and coming off a string of Super Tuesday wins, Mr. Trump will be at center stage, fending off attacks from his remaining rivals and questions from what could be fairly described as his least favorite moderating team.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThese candidates are kind of like horses at the gate,\\u201d said Bret Baier, who will join Chris Wallace and Ms. Kelly as moderators. \\u201cEspecially the ones that need to make headway quickly, because they see that Donald Trump is in the position to secure the nomination.\\u201d\\\",\\\"This week the three of them talked about their preparations and how they see their roles.\\\",\\\"Fox News shattered cable news records with 24 million viewers for its first debate, in August. Mr. Trump was angered that night by Ms. Kelly\\u2019s questioning of his treatment of women, including insulting remarks he has made in the past. After the debate, he seemed to suggest that she had been menstruating. He skipped the second Fox News debate after the network refused to remove Ms. Kelly from the panel.\\\",\\\"Ms. Kelly described her question as a level \\u201c10.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cOne of the reasons the first debate was so dynamic was because we opened up with a 10 for each candidate,\\u201d said Ms. Kelly, explaining that the moderating team was trying to probe \\u201cthe Achilles\\u2019 heel\\u201d of each candidate and get them to respond. \\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t as much about having the candidates spar, it was more about \\u2018this is who you are, this is what you stand for.\\u2019\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe for some reason didn\\u2019t think that question was fair, and then, I think, spent many weeks proving to the world it was fair,\\u201d Ms. Kelly said.\\\",\\\"On Thursday night, since Mr. Trump and his opponents are well known by now, Ms. Kelly added, \\u201cI doubt the very first question of the debate will be from me to Trump.\\u201d That\\u2019s not to say there wouldn\\u2019t be a \\u201c10\\u201d for him Thursday night. \\u201cWe probably want to ease into it a little more.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m sure we could just throw out at any point, I mean, you take your pick: \\u2018The fingers, go!\\u2019\\u201d she joked, alluding to Mr. Rubio\\u2019s remarks last week that Mr. Trump had small hands. \\u201cThat\\u2019s not going to be one of the questions, but there\\u2019s so many issues on which they\\u2019ll engage now.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m a fight fan, and when you watch a referee in a match, even if the fighters are tangled up, if they\\u2019ve each got a free arm and are still punching, the ref will let them keep fighting,\\u201d Mr. Wallace said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s only when they get completely tangled up that he makes them break the clinch and start again. That\\u2019s my feeling about it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Recent debates have drifted away from policy into schoolyard taunts, creating \\u201can embarrassment for theRepublican Party,\\u201d Mr. Wallace said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI thought that if you could see someone acting like a president on the stage, you have better eyesight than I do,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cHaving said that, in the end, if the candidates want to act like damn fools, I\\u2019m not going to stop them.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Before Mr. Trump made it official that he was skipping the second Fox News debate, the moderators had \\u201ctwo different blueprints\\u201d for the debate, as Mr. Baier put it, one with Mr. Trump and one without.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think hehas conceded afterwardthat was probably not the right move,\\u201d Mr. Baier said of Mr. Trump, \\u201cand maybe cost some votes in Iowa.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In preparing for their debates, the moderators divide up the questioning by issues, or \\u201cbuckets,\\u201d and each host has to be conversant in his or her topics in order to fact-check and question candidates\\u2019 assertions immediately.\\\",\\\"Before the debate, they aggressively pick apart each proposed question, pointing out potential \\u201cdismounts,\\u201d as Mr. Baier calls them, or ways a candidate could evade the question, and highlighting weaknesses by thinking with the same blunt, pointed and assertive nature as a candidate.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt can be a little painful at times,\\u201d said Mr. Wallace. \\u201cSometimes it can be tough and it doesn\\u2019t feel great, but it\\u2019s to make all of us better and the debate better.\\u201d\\\",\\\"And when the debate starts Thursday night, \\u201cI expect it to be pretty intense,\\u201d said Mr. Wallace, noting that theSuper Tuesday resultsestablished Mr. Trump as \\u201cclearly the front-runner,\\u201d but that he has not put the race away. \\u201cThere\\u2019ll be a 12-day window until winner-take-all in Florida and Ohio where I think some candidate is going to have to show he can stop Trump or he may be unstoppable.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 344469, \"title\": \"Fox Moderators to Face Donald Trump in Thursday\\u2019s Debate\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
