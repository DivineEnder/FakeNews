"{\"title\": \"Two U.S. Secret Meetings with North Korea Last Year\", \"content\": \"Tommy Vietor, spokesman for the National Security Council, responded in an email, brusquely, \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to comment on this.\\u201d Sydney Seiler, who is in charge of Korea policy at the National Security Council and attended both April and August\\u2019s meetings, could not be reached for comment.Just this month, North Korea launched its third and most powerful underground nuclear test. Last year\\u2019s April visit was designed to convince Kim Jong Un not to use long-range rockets. Pyongyang launched a rocket unsuccessfully on April 12, but followed with a successful launch in December. Joseph DeTrani, a North Korea expert who ran the National Counter Proliferation Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led the April trip. He no longer works for the government; he now runs the Intelligence and National Security Alliance. He defended the trip, asserting, \\u201cI was initially guardedly optimistic that [Kim Jong Un] was moving in the right direction. With the launches and the test, he\\u2019s reversed that.\\u201dBut Gen. Kim Kyok-Sik, who was later appointed defense minister by Kim Jong Un, was alleged to be the one who ordered the 2010 shelling of a South Korean island killing four people, and also an attack on a South Korean naval ship that killed 46 sailors.Some experts also defended the trips; John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University, said, \\u201cThe trips were a good idea and I think the fact that they did them secretly was a good idea.\\u201d One former U.S. official agreed: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know why at this point the administration just doesn\\u2019t set the record straight on this. All it shows is that we were trying to walk the last mile with North Korea.\\u201dStrangely enough, congressional intelligence and foreign affairs committees were never briefed on the visits.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 238377}"
