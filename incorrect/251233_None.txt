"{\"title\": \"Director: 'Noah' Environmental Story ... Not Very Religious'\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"But anyone hoping the \\u201cBlack Swan\\u201d director will tell a spiritually profound tale, one that has inspired Christians for centuries, may want to consider Aronofsky\\u2019s comments on the project.The director explained his vision for \\u201cNoah\\u201d to Slash Film back in 2008:It\\u2019s the end of the world and it\\u2019s the second most famous ship after the Titanic. So I\\u2019m not sure why any studio won\\u2019t want to make it,\\u201d said Aronofsky. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s really timely because it\\u2019s about environmental apocalypse which is the biggest theme, for me, right now for what\\u2019s going on on this planet. So I think it\\u2019s got these big, big themes that connect with us. Noah was the first environmentalist.Here\\u2019s another Aronofsky nugget guaranteed to alienate a massive movie demographic \\u2013 the faith-based crowd:I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a very religious story\\u2026 I think it\\u2019s a great fable that\\u2019s part of so many different religions and spiritual practices. I just think it\\u2019s a great story that\\u2019s never been on film.\\u201d \\u2026 \\u201cHe\\u2019s a dark, complicated character. The tragedies we perform on each other are so well reported. Quite clearly, the planet is dying, and we are dying on it.Not a religious story? The planet is \\u201cclearly\\u201d dying?Taken together, the comments make little sense from a marketing point of view. Micro-indies like \\u201cCourageous\\u201d and \\u201cOctober Baby\\u201d have proven ridiculously profitable in recent years, tapping into a large segment of spiritual movie-goers who rarely get projects aimed at them.Had Aronofsky targeted them, as well as those who simply love blockbuster entertainment, \\u201cNoah\\u201d could be a can\\u2019t-miss sensation.Now, with the film\\u2019s eco-themes front and center, it stands a better than average chance of alienating people of faith as well as those who don\\u2019t worship at the eco-altar of Al Gore.\", \"article_id\": 251233}"
