"{\"title\": \"University of Missouri Dons All-White Uniforms after Black Student Protests\", \"content\": \"Microaggression? Institutional racism? Triggering tint?The all-white privilege comes as a first in the history of the football program and follows the university president\\u2019s resignation earlier this week after more than thirty black football players boycotted team activities. Earlier today, someone\\u2014maybe the same mysterious figure who drew a swastika with his feces\\u2014redacted the \\u201cBlack\\u201d in the Black Culture Center\\u2019s sign with spraypaint. Columbia remains volatile, as though waiting, in order to launch a new round of teach-ins and takeovers, for some well-meaning but benighted freshman to utter blackguard, or some other subconsciously racist term, in relation to the anonymous bigots painting and shouting hate speech (before disappearing into the night) all over campus. But the school wants everyone to know that the white duds don\\u2019t come as a fashionable response to that black dude\\u2019s hunger strike. Really they don\\u2019t.\\u201cPrior to the season, Mizzou Assistant Athletic Director for Equipment Don Barnes came up with a uniform concept that Mizzou had never worn: a white base jersey-pant combo with black numbers and an anthracite Tiger stripe overlay accompanied by a white helmet equipped with a chrome secondary Tiger logo and facemask,\\u201d a news release from the athletic department announces. \\u201cThe uniform combination will also feature gloves with the anthracite Tiger stripe pattern.\\u201dThat last part\\u2019s good to know. Anthracite appears blackish, so it\\u2019s appearance on the unis surely will please the perpetually displeased. But white clearly occupies a hegemonic, privileged position on the gear, acting as a bright, shining metaphor for the truths told in sociology class. Perhaps to mitigate against any such outrage the school\\u2019s athletic department emphasizes that the \\u201cjerseys feature black numbers.\\u201dThe timing, like presiding over a university right when preschool sensitivities preside over its students, seems off. White\\u2019s just not in fashion, at least not in Columbia, Missouri.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 298635}"
