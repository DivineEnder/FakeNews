"{\"title\": \"Donald Trump Doesn\\u2019t Understand Common Core (and Neither Do His Rivals)\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Donald Trump\\u2019s presidential campaign has not been driven by detailed policy papers. But on one issue at least, his position is clear: He hates the Common Core State Standards. They are, hesays, a \\u201ctotal disaster,\\u201d and he promises to abolish them upon assuming the presidency, because education \\u201chas to be at a local level.\\u201d\\\",\\\"This is revealing, and not just because it shows Mr. Trump\\u2019s ignorance of how American education actually works. He is promising to solve a problem that doesn\\u2019t exist by using power the president doesn\\u2019t have. His plan may also have the unintended effect of stultifying American greatness.\\\",\\\"The president can\\u2019t end the Common Core, because the federal government didn\\u2019t create the Common Core. Governors and state boards of education developed and voluntarily adopted the standards in reading, language and math. Some states subsequently un-adopted them, as is their right. When Congress passed a new version of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act last year, it prohibited the secretary of education from requiring or even encouraging states to adopt any uniform standards, Common Core or otherwise.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump has another claim about education: that America\\u2019s weak educational results will be improved by returning power to local school districts. That\\u2019s a notion, widely held, that is at odds with research, common sense and the education agenda of every president, Republican and Democrat, for the past 40 years.\\\",\\\"Jimmy Carter elevated the Department of Education to a Cabinet-level agency. Ronald Reagan was initially cold to education standards, preferring to focus on vouchers \\u2014 until his secretary of education, Terrel Bell, released the landmark \\u201cA Nation at Risk\\u201d report in 1983. It found that many locally controlled districts were letting students wander through their school years with few if any rigorous courses in math, science, literature or history.\\\",\\\"President George H.W. Bush took up the banner next, collaborating with Bill Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, to rally the nation\\u2019s governors around high academic standards. As president, Mr. Clinton built on that idea by shepherding a new education law in 1994 that required states to develop common standards for all schools within the state, and hold schools accountable for helping students measure up. George W. Bush embraced that idea as governor of Texas, and strengthened it with theNo Child Left Behind Actof 2001. President Obama supported the Common Core by using money from the 2009 economic stimulus package to finance better standardized tests and reward states that adopted challenging standards.\\\",\\\"Educational improvement over that time period was steady, if not fast enough for anyone\\u2019s liking. The nation\\u2019s elementary school students made remarkable progress. The percentage of fourth graders who are proficient in mathematicstripledfrom 1990 to 2015. While high school students have not improved as fast, they are graduating at thehighest rate in history. One of the main obstacles to further improvement, you could easily argue, is that standards still aren\\u2019t common enough.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump is correct that education is \\u201cat\\u201d a local level. Local school districts hire the principals and teachers, and experiment with methods and curriculums that they think work for their children. Most districts still have substantial autonomy to raise school taxes, though some districts aren\\u2019t able to and this can lead to pervasive inequality between rich and poor districts and brings our national results down.\\\",\\\"But states and localities, in a sense, don\\u2019t actually have the ability to set educational standards, even if they choose to. The world around us ultimately determines what students need to learn \\u2014 the demands of highly competitive and increasingly global labor markets, the admissions requirements of colleges and universities, and the march of scientific progress.\\\",\\\"The only choice local schools have is whether they will try to meet those expectations. The Common Core is simply a way of organizing and articulating standards that already exist, for the benefit of students, parents and teachers, so that schooling makes sense when children move between different grades, schools, districts and states.\\\",\\\"Indeed, while Mr. Trump on the stump frequently complains that American test scores lag behind those of other nations, he doesn\\u2019t mention that many high-achieving countries have adopted common standards for all students.\\\",\\\"Why, then, does he hate the Common Core? Because many voters hate the Common Core, which has been subject to an intense disinformation campaign in recent years. Did you know that the Common Core was funded by Col.Muammar el-Qaddafiand Bill Ayers as part of President Obama\\u2019s plan to imposeShariaLaw on American schoolchildren and create a new Islamic caliphate? It wasn\\u2019t, but you might think so if youread The Washington Times.\\\",\\\"In fairness, Mr. Trump is not alone. Marco Rubio haspledgedthat on his first day in office he will stop \\u201cany and all work on imposing Common Core on this country.\\u201d (That will be easy, since there is no such federal work.) Ted Cruz has denounced the Common Core and supported the Local Control of Education Act, which would have the perverse effect of keeping tens of billions of taxpayer dollars flowing to government schools and their unionized work force while removing any requirements that those schools show educational results in exchange.\\\",\\\"But Mr. Trump, more than his rivals, has made opposition to Common Core a part of the pillar of his (admittedly thin) domestic agenda. It\\u2019s an education vision that is ultimately neither liberal nor conservative. It\\u2019s a repudiation of four decades of bipartisan effort, and a return to a time when children were at the mercy of whatever local schools decided they should or should not learn.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 344591}"
