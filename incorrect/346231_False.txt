"{\"title\": \"Clinton, Seizing On Trump\\u2019s 2006 Remarks, Opens Line of Attack\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 346231, \"content\": \"{\\\"For weeks,Hillary Clintonand her campaign have struggled to find a line of attack that could work againstDonald J. Trump, one of the most atypical and nonideological candidates the Republicans have prepared to nominate for president.\\\",\\\"On Tuesday, she appeared to have found one. Mrs. Clinton seized on a comment that Mr. Trump made when he was running Trump University in 2006, in which he appeared to root for a housing bubble collapse because, he said, people like him could make money off it.\\\",\\\"In a style similar to Twitter attacks against Mr. Trump by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s team repeatedly posted that her main rival was ultimately looking out only for himself.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIn Trump\\u2019s world, a \\u2018good result\\u2019 means Trump gets his and working families get hurt. We\\u2019re better than that,\\u201dMrs. Clinton\\u2019s aideswrote in one post on Twitter.\\\",\\\"It is an effort to try and define Mr. Trump along the same line Democrats used with Mitt Romney in 2012 \\u2014 as a heartless businessman. Whether it can succeed remains to be seen.\\\",\\\"In a statement, Mr. Trump said: \\u201cI am a businessman, and I have made a lot of money in down markets. In some cases, as much as I\\u2019ve made when markets are good. Frankly, this is the kind of thinking our country needs, understanding how to get a good result out of a very bad and sad situation. Politicians have no idea how to do this \\u2014 they don\\u2019t have a clue.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s team has hoped to portray Mr. Trump as a dangerous \\u201ccon man,\\u201d as Democrats have said for days, whose self-interest clashes with the reservoir of populism he has tapped into.\\\",\\\"And in critical battlegrounds like Florida and Nevada, where the 2008 housing crisis was deeply felt, Mr. Trump\\u2019s past comments could haunt him. The question for Mrs. Clinton is whether she can penetrate the din that Mr. Trump has created around scandals from her husband\\u2019s days in the White House.\\\"}\"}"
