"{\"title\": \"Schweizer: 'There Are More Emails' About the Clinton Foundation, State Dept 'Doing the Bidding of the Clintons'\", \"content\": \"On Wednesday\\u2019s broadcast of the Fox News Channel\\u2019s \\u201cKelly File,\\u201d Breitbart editor at large and author of \\u201cClinton Cash\\u201d\\u00a0Peter Schweizer stated that there are more emails pertaining to the Clinton Foundation that will come out and that \\u201cThe State Department\\u2019s not doing the bidding of the American people. They\\u2019re doing the bidding of the Clintons, and it has to stop.\\u201dSchweizer said newly-released emails regarding the Clinton Foundation are \\u201cfurther confirmation to what we\\u2019ve been talking about for more than a year, that there\\u2019s been pay to play at the Clinton State Department related to the Clinton Foundation, and the Clintons have failed to deal with any of the substance of these issues.\\u201dHe added, \\u201cI\\u00a0know there are more emails. There are emails that are being produced almost on a weekly basis for both Judicial Watch and Citizens United. You have Julian Assange saying that we\\u2019re probably going to see more emails. Look, here\\u2019s the bottom line, and you saw a little bit of it today with the State Department, but the media has to hold Hillary Clinton accountable and ask her to answer these questions. Here\\u2019s why this is so troubling. This is not a typical money in politics story. We\\u2019re used to Wall Street, oil companies, etc., giving donations to politicians, getting access, but federal law prevents foreign businessmen and governments from doing so. The Clinton Foundation is a gateway around that.\\u201dSchweizer concluded, \\u201c[L]ook, you talk to Judicial Watch and Citizens United, the State Department is fighting tooth and nail to prevent any emails from coming out. Federal judges are forcing them to do this. The State Department\\u2019s not doing the bidding of the American people. They\\u2019re doing the bidding of the Clintons, and it has to stop. And God bless these federal judges for forcing them to release this material.\\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 162694}"
