"{\"title\": \"Geert Wilders Visit Down Under: A Success And A Warning To Australia\", \"content\": \"Australia desperately needs the ALA. These are decent people who want to pass on the Australia\\u00a0they know and love to their children.I had thought prior to my arrival that the Aussies are not quite in the fix we Europeans find\\u00a0ourselves, and while this still remains true, Australia is heading, very rapidly, down the same road as\\u00a0the rest of us \\u2013 political correctness, left-wing bullying and lies, leaders who refuse to listen to those\\u00a0with concerns about Islamic immigration, and a mainstream media entirely complicit and approving\\u00a0of all of the above.Some of the coverage of the ALA launch is worth surveying. As is the case here in Europe,\\u00a0mainstream journalism in Australia has decided that the new party is the problem, and not what it\\u00a0wants to oppose. The usual labels of \\u201cfar-right\\u201d are thrown around, and most of the Australian\\u00a0press seems to believe that their country is a shining example of multicultural harmony; despite the\\u00a0overwhelming evidence to suggest otherwise.Take this example from the\\u00a0Daily Telegraph in Sydney which claimed that Wilders was in Australia to \\u201cwater\\u00a0the seeds of discontent\\u201d. It then accused him, of course, of being motivated by \\u201chatred\\u201d. The writer\\u00a0speculates as to just where Mr Wilders\\u2019 \\u201chatred\\u201d might have come from.His objections to Muslim\\u00a0immigration are a complete mystery it seems. Extraordinarily, and yet typically, there is\\u00a0acknowledgement of the genuine threat that Wilders and the new ALA candidates have to contend\\u00a0with \\u2013 thereby proving their point about the problems Muslim immigration brings \\u2013 but the writer\\u00a0still cannot connect the dots and understand that it is the fact that our politicians are threatened\\u00a0that is causing some of them to fight back. The fight is one for our very civilisation.This one from the news.com.au website suggests that an \\u201cugly\\u201d Australia will emerge if the ALA sees\\u00a0significant success. It quotes one Professor Andrew Markus of Monash University as stating: \\u201cThere\\u00a0will always be a segment of the community that is not happy with change\\u201d.But it isn\\u2019t change that\\u00a0the ALA opposes, it is sharia law, special privileges for religious bullies, misogyny, gang-rape,\\u00a0intimidation, honour killing, and all the other niceties that mass Muslim immigration brings to\\u00a0Western societies. Even those who accept there is a problem, such as a second professor quoted in\\u00a0the same article, are adamant that the only problem is \\u201cradicalisation\\u201d and the ever-popular \\u201ctiny\\u00a0minority\\u201d of extremists.Wrong. In Somalia, 90-odd per cent of girls have their genitals butchered by\\u00a0their own families. This is not a tiny minority. In places like Pakistan, people are horrifically\\u00a0murdered (by law) for having an opinion. The law of the land is not the domain of a tiny minority or\\u00a0an extreme radical fringe. Common sense should tell us that when people move from those\\u00a0countries to Australia, they will bring many ghastly practices with them \\u2013 this is what the ALA was\\u00a0set up to resist. Good, because very few other Aussie \\u201cpollies\\u201d are up to the task.The politicians Down Under sound distinctly like the weak-willed careerists we\\u2019ve become so\\u00a0accustomed to in Europe. The Premier of Western Australia (WA), the state in which the launch took\\u00a0place, said that Wilders would not be allowed to use any public buildings during his visit to Perth.Therefore, Colin Barnett unilaterally decided that those who support Geert Wilders in Australia, or\\u00a0agree with his right to make his arguments openly and without demonisation, are barred from\\u00a0Western Australia\\u2019s publicly owned spaces. Only certain opinions are permitted a public airing in\\u00a0Western Australia. It\\u2019s all sounding very\\u00a0familiar.The opposition leader in WA added his tuppence worth by complaining about \\u201coverseas\\u201d politicians\\u00a0causing trouble. I wonder if he\\u2019s ever said the same about the \\u201coverseas\\u201d jihadis who preach\\u00a0violence and rape in his country \\u2013 one suspects not.Politicians from across the floor jostled to the front of\\u00a0condemnation queue, desperate to ensure their PC credentials by vilifying Wilders and the ALA and\\u00a0ensuring that none of the valid points they raise are actually discussed. One politician reminded the\\u00a0ALA that Australia has constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion. He must have forgotten to\\u00a0mention that freedom of religion is one of the core reasons that the ALA opposes Islam.The reality\\u00a0of the death penalty for blasphemy and apostasy that is widespread in the Islamic world also\\u00a0appears to have slipped his mind.In short, Australia is a few years behind us, but it is well on its way to full-blown dhimmitude if\\u00a0something doesn\\u2019t change fast; enter the Australian Liberty Alliance. Their core policies are a 10\\u00a0year moratorium on immigration from member countries of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation,\\u00a0an end to divisive multiculturalism, the restoration of true freedom of speech, a reduction in bloated\\u00a0and wasteful government, the establishment of common sense and respect in Australian society,\\u00a0and the preservation of this great country for future generations.The launch itself was high-spirited and the people were passionate and energetic. The atmosphere\\u00a0was one of hope and determination. The ALA\\u2019s candidates are exciting and talented and I have no\\u00a0doubt they will shake Australian politics and change that country\\u2019s direction. In the last few years,\\u00a0Australia has witnessed what we all have across the West \\u2013 terrorist attacks, child marriage, gang-\\u00a0rapes, the sanitisation of sharia by leaders and media, and the growth of a sinister anti-Western\\u00a0sentiment.There are problems in schools, problems with corruption, and needless to say, vocal demands from\\u00a0suit-and-tie jihadis to introduce sharia law in family and financial matters for Muslims in Australia.\\u00a0A few years ago, ABC reported that the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils \\u201cin a submission to\\u00a0the Federal Parliament\\u2019s Committee on Multicultural Affairs\\u2026 asked for the change [the\\u00a0introduction of sharia family law].\\u201dIkebal Patel, the Federation\\u2019s president, gave a master-class in\\u00a0double-speak when pushing his sharia agenda. According to the report, Patel agreed that the word\\u00a0sharia conjures up images of a \\u201cfierce, unjust, male-dominated legal code\\u201d.Of course it conjures up those images, because that is precisely what it is.Patel assures us that sharia \\u201cguarantees women\\u2019s rights that are not recognised in mainstream\\u00a0Australian courts\\u201d. Can\\u2019t argue with that; Australian law allows a woman the same right to divorce\\u00a0as a man, it allows her the right to leave a violent marriage, it allows her the right to be a grown-up if\\u00a0and when she marries, and her testimony has the same value as her husband\\u2019s. None of this exists\\u00a0under sharia so in that respect he\\u2019s absolutely right.Following his organisation\\u2019s submission for sharia family law, Patel firmly asserted that \\u201cthere\\u2019s no\\u00a0aspect of sharia that is being tried to be introduced here\\u201d, followed by a claim that everyone would\\u00a0benefit if sharia were instituted. Confused? That\\u2019s the idea. You\\u2019re not supposed to know the truth\\u00a0about the tyranny that these taqiyya merchants are sneaking through the back door, if you did, you\\u00a0may just oppose it\\u2026.and that would never do.I went to the launch of the Australian Liberty Alliance to offer my fullest support to that wonderful\\u00a0group of brave and principled people, but also to ask for their help in the restoration of free speech\\u00a0throughout the West. Following the cartoons, I said I intended to build a global coalition for free\\u00a0speech, and I can think of few better places to start than Australia.As I told them on the night of the launch, the ALA will have to take many punches; they\\u2019ll be\\u00a0smeared, bullied, harassed, threatened, and vilified by their own leaders and media. They will need\\u00a0to find the inner strength to stand firm on their message, and to get up again when they are knocked\\u00a0down. Having met the candidates, and their fantastic president Debbie Robinson, I don\\u2019t think that\\u00a0is going to be a problem.Good luck to the Australian Liberty Alliance. They deserve every success that is coming their way.Anne Marie Waters is a London Assembly Member candidate for the UK Independence Party\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 246422}"
