"{\"content\": \"{\\\"ANDERSON, S.C. \\u2014 Along the storied hallways of the United States Capitol, Senator Tim Scott moves quietly, often disappearing behind his loquacious Senate colleagues and frenetic staff.\\\",\\\"But here in his home state, South Carolina, Mr. Scott, a Republican freshman, returned to his elemental political self Monday night: standing before scores of voters, a giant poster of Abraham Lincoln behind him, quoting Scripture (Proverbs 27:17), making fun of Representative Trey Gowdy\\u2019s hair (overly styled) and playing the unlikely role of presidential kingmaker. He put former Gov.Mike Huckabeeof Arkansas through his paces in the first of Mr. Scott\\u2019s town-hall-style meetings featuring Republican presidential hopefuls in a state vital to winning his party\\u2019s nomination.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI take great joy in showing off South Carolina,\\u201d Mr. Scott said. \\u201cI\\u2019m an introvert personally, but when I am up there, that\\u2019s when I am on the clock.\\u201d\\\",\\\"On the stage, Mr. Scott, the first black Republican from the South elected to the Senate since late in the 19th century, did not mention the Confederate battle flag, which the South Carolina Senatehad votedhours before to remove from the grounds of the State House, a move Mr. Scott supports. He made a passing reference tothe killing of nine peopleat Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston last month, which he had emotionally and uncharacteristically addressed on the Senate floor, and that was largely to allow Mr. Huckabee to praise the victims\\u2019 families.\\\",\\\"Nor did he bring upthe shootingof a fleeing black motorist by a white police officer in North Charleston in April, which had inspired him to call for a hearing on the use of body cameras by law enforcement officers.\\\",\\\"Mr. Scott\\u2019s wont has been to carefully avoid leveraging his race, even as history has had other ideas for him.\\\",\\\"Rather than using his stature and the trust he has with conservatives to press for more understanding within his party on racial issues, Mr. Scott seems determined to win respect where he does not have it: among some liberal senators and especially with black Democrats, who have largely rejected him.\\\",\\\"The massacre in Charleston \\u201chas become a blunt force for change in my priorities and responsibilities,\\u201d Mr. Scott said in an interview over a giant plate of fried rice. \\u201cThere is an intangible force of people who are not like-minded being drawn into the same spirit. There is an opportunity to make a new first impression.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As a citizen and as a lawmaker, Mr. Scott, 49, has often felt the sting of being singled out because of his race. He was stopped by the police numerous times while a member of the Charleston County Council, including a time when several cars approached him, \\u201clights blazing,\\u201d as he drove his car through \\u201cthe ghetto\\u201d to visit his grandfather, he said.\\\",\\\"The Capitol Police have stopped him more than once, said Mr. Gowdy,his close friendin Congress, as he has walked into Senate office buildings for work. \\u201cHe tells them, \\u2018I know I look young for a senator,\\u2019 \\u201d Mr. Gowdy said.\\\",\\\"Stories like those have had an obvious effect on Republican lawmakers for whom tales of \\u201cdriving while black\\u201d or chants of \\u201cblack lives matter\\u201d from liberal activists carry less force.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAfrican-Americans and white Americans see things through different lenses,\\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. The focus of those different lenses, he said, \\u201ccomes up more in personal relationships\\u201d than in political showcases.\\\",\\\"Having Mr. Scott stand on the Senate floor, holding back tears as he spoke about the victims of the Charleston shootings, left a deep impression on many colleagues, who stood in silence and watched. \\u201cTim Scott was a House member from where the first shots were fired in Fort Sumter,\\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said in an interview.\\\",\\\"Mr. Scott was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and was on his way, he has said, to a forfeited life until a Chick-fil-A franchise owner took him under his wing and schooled him in conservative ideas.\\\",\\\"He was elected to the County Council in 1995 and to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 2008 \\u2014 and in 2010, he won a United States House seat, besting Paul Thurmond, a son of former Senator Strom Thurmond, and others. In December 2012, Gov. Nikki R. Haleypicked Mr. Scottto replace Jim DeMint in theUnited States Senatewhen Mr. DeMint unexpectedly retired. He won an election in 2014 to complete the term.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI have found myself in a position where some folks who I had rare conversations with are now calling on me, conversing and strategizing about the next steps,\\u201d Mr. Scott said. The pastor who presided over the funerals of the nineCharleston victimsasked him to speak \\u201cafter the sixth or seventh one, after he saw that I was still there\\u201d from one service after the next, he said. A pastor at another A.M.E. church who had largely avoided Mr. Scott invited him to speak at his church this year, too.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI was pleased we had broken down some barriers,\\u201d Mr. Scott said.\\\",\\\"Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, approached him on the Senate floor after his remarks about the shooting, he said, and asked, \\u201cCould I hug you?\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI have been surprised by the response by some very hardened senators on both sides who were visibly moved by this tragedy,\\u201d he said, adding that his priorities were addressing poverty and joblessness among blacks. \\u201cPastors and community leaders who would not be willing to listen to me now see credibility.\\u201d\\\",\\\"For black civil rights activists who have eyed Mr. Scott warily \\u2014 he is skeptical of enhancements to the 1965Voting Rights Act, for instance, and is fiscally conservative about social programs for the poor \\u2014 have been watching with curiosity.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think he is evolving,\\u201d said Marc H. Morial, the president of the National Urban League. \\u201cThe political reality is, to some extent, Republicans need a Tim Scott, and they need him to move the needle on these issues. We will be watching closely. I appreciated that he stepped up to take the flag down.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Scott often seems whipsawed between black Democrats who are appalled by his politics and white Republicans who long to use him as a spokesman and racial buffer for conservative policies.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhether it is people on his side wanting to use him because he is in a very, very small group, Republicans of color, or the other side taking shots at him, he has to put up with more than the rest of us ever would,\\u201d Mr. Gowdy said.\\\",\\\"If Mr. Scott has one guiding force, it seems to be religion. He often reads the Bible between votes and references Scripture in casual conversation; in his town-hall-style meetings, which have become an essential stop for Republican White House hopefuls; and at home in his district.\\\",\\\"\\u201cA blogger back in South Carolina once wrote this thing that was horrifically mean and inaccurate when we were freshmen\\u201d in the House, said Mr. Gowdy, a former prosecutor who was elected to the House with Mr. Scott in 2010. He recalled marching into Mr. Scott\\u2019s office and demanding to see him.\\\",\\\"When Mr. Scott appeared, Mr. Gowdy recalled saying, \\u201cWe have got to do something about this right now,\\u201d and Mr. Scott replying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re right. Close the door.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI thought: \\u2018Good, we are going to get somewhere. He wants to close the door with a prosecutor with a diabolical mind,\\u2019 \\u201d Mr. Gowdy said. \\u201cAnd he said, \\u2018We are going to pray for him.\\u2019 I said: \\u2018You\\u2019ve got to be kidding. I am not doing that.\\u2019 And he said, \\u2018Then you sit with me while I do.\\u2019 \\u201d\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 339975, \"title\": \"Senator Tim Scott Sees Barriers Coming Down, After Charleston Church Attack\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
