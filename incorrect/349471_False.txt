"{\"article_id\": 349471, \"content\": \"BRUSSELS\\u2014The European Union is considering changes to online rules to help investigators better fight crime and terror, the bloc\\u2019s justice chief said in an interview.The European Commission, the bloc\\u2019s executive body, is drafting several options to change rules to allow\\u00a0criminal and antiterror investigators greater access to evidence of criminal activity stored in clouds, Justice Commissioner \\n      Vera Jourova\\n       said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.The commission will submit the options to EU governments in June with the aim of seeking\\u00a0views from the public on proposed changes\\u00a0in the second half of the year.Separately, Ms. Jourova said she was also scrutinizing whether national rules in Europe are needed to ensure technology firms move quickly to take down hate speech and radical rhetoric from their platforms.With the online-evidence\\u00a0initiative, the commission is trying to allow judges\\u00a0faster access to evidence before it is deleted by the perpetrators or the cloud service provider. Delays occur when judges from one jurisdiction need access to evidence in another jurisdiction where computer servers are based.\\u201cWe have very strong signals from the side of prosecutors and judges, that they have very unclear conditions for how to get such evidence as early as possible,\\u201d she said.The comments came just ahead of her trip to Washington this week where, among others, she will meet with Attorney General \\n      Jeff Sessions\\n       and Commerce Secretary \\n      Wilbur Ross.Ms. Jourova also said the commission was working on a second report that would come out in April, following one first published in December, that analyzes whether \\n        Alphabet\\n         Inc.\\u2019s\\n       Google, \\n        Facebook\\n         Inc.,\\n        Twitter\\n         Inc.\\n       and \\n        Microsoft\\n         Inc.\\n       move quickly enough to remove hate-speech content from their platforms, as agreed to in a common code of conduct with the EU last May.When asked about legislative initiatives in Germany and Austria to legally require tech companies to remove hate speech content quickly, she said she would be in better position to say whether those \\u201ctougher\\u201d and \\u201cnonvoluntary\\u201d rules were necessary after the report is published.Such rules would move beyond the voluntary agreement tech companies struck with the European Union to remove from their websites information visible in Europe that incites hatred. A separate initiative with the EU is aimed at the takedown of terror content, such as Islamic State propaganda videos.In the hate speech code of conduct, the four large tech companies vowed that they would review precise and substantial complaints on user\\u2019s behavior\\u00a0within 24 hours\\u00a0of receiving them and cut off access to the content, if required.But Ms. Jourova said there were thousands of smaller companies that weren\\u2019t part of the pact, and this was an argument for legislation, though arguments in favor of freedom of expression were important.Internet companies have faced increased pressure from authorities to speed up the takedown of terrorist content and hate speech after a number of deadly terror attacks in Europe in recent months.The companies already endeavor to remove illegal information when it is reported, but face criticism they don\\u2019t do so rapidly enough or take enough of the content down. The tech firms say they are wary of initiatives that infringe on freedom of expression.The tech firms say they also work with the EU to identify and discredit extremist speech by promoting so-called \\u201ccounter-narratives\\u201d and supporting educational programs that encourage critical thinking.But a push for U.S. tech firms to grant European police direct access to their clients\\u2019 emails, messages and other content stored in the cloud would put American firms in a bind. Technology companies say they already cooperate as much as they can with European law enforcement, but that they are barred under U.S. laws from sharing more than limited personal information directly with European authorities except in emergencies.Instead, they direct foreign authorities to channel requests through the U.S. government through a process set out in bilateral treaties\\u2014something European police officials complain can take months.EU laws mandating direct access for foreign law enforcement\\u2014if not accompanied by new data-sharing treaties or legal changes in the U. S.\\u2014could put companies \\u201cin a situation where you have to decide what law to break,\\u201d said \\n      Brad Smith, \\n       Microsoft Corp.\\u2019s chief legal officer, during an interview in early 2016.In Washington, Ms. Jourova will hold discussions with U.S. officials, businesses and nonprofit organizations mainly about the so-called Privacy Shield, a mechanism that allows businesses to transfer data about Europeans to U.S. -based servers.She said the commission was reassured that a recent executive order signed in by President \\n      Donald Trump\\n       wouldn\\u2019t impact the trans-Atlantic arrangement but that she would continue to monitor any developments.Separately, encryption remains a hot-button issue for law enforcement, but Ms. Jourova isn\\u2019t proposing new legislation in that area.In the aftermath of the London attack last week, British officials tore into tech companies for offering end-to-end encryption, allowing terrorists a place to hide their online communications.\\u2014Sam Schechner contributed to this article.Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.comAppeared in the Mar. 31, 2017, print edition as 'EU Weighs Rule Changes to Fight Online Criminals.'\", \"title\": \"EU seeks greater access to online data for anti-crime, terror investigators \", \"source_id\": 22245}"
