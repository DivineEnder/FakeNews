"{\"title\": \"EU Funded Group Calls Donald Trump A 'Hate Preacher', Urges UK Ban... Says Nothing Of Terror Migrants\", \"content\": \"Their comments have been labelled \\u201csinister\\u201d by mainstream journalists who also dislike Mr. Trump. The group has made no statements about the number of Islamist-sympathising migrants being caught across Europe.On Monday Mr Trump, the front-runner in the race to become the Republican presidential candidate, called for \\u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\\u201d\\u2018British Future\\u2019 masquerades as a think tank, though lists as its donors the European Commission, the pro-migration Barrow Cadbury Trust, the hedge-fund run Unbound Philanthropy group which also funds almost all pro-migration groups in the United Kingdom, and the notorious George Soros\\u2019s \\u201cOpen Society Foundations\\u201d which call for an end to national borders.The group now wants to see Britain\\u2019s Home Secretary Theresa May ban Mr Trump from the UK on the grounds of hate speech, with its director,\\u00a0Sunder Katwala, saying he wants to make it \\u201cvery clear that this extreme view is rejected and repudiated in the strongest possible terms.\\u201cThe UK Home Office has set out clear guidelines which have led to the exclusion of preachers of hate from the UK if their presence here would not be conducive to the public good,\\u201d he said.\\u201cTheresa May has excluded extreme Islamists on these grounds, and also kept out those who have fanned extreme anti-Muslim prejudice, such as the bloggers Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer. Trump\\u2019s statements are more extreme than theirs.\\u201cUnless and until Trump were to retract these highly prejudiced comments, there is a good case for making clear that he would be refused entry to the UK by the Home Secretary.\\u201dMr Katwala\\u2019s comments were slammed by Frasier Nelson, editor of The Spectator, who took to Facebook to say: \\u201cDonald Trump is an insult to America and mankind \\u2013 but the idea that he should be banned from Britain for extreme views (rather than being an idiot) is kinda sinister. And it shows the growth of this creepy no-platform brigade. Always and everywhere, it\\u2019s better to out-argue creeps and bigots than to try to censor them.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 145656}"
