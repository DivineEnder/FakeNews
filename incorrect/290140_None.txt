Zucker said it was not \\u201cour role to editorialize\\u201d or take \\u201ca point of view.\\u201d\\u201cIt\\u2019s our role to report what he says, what he does, to fact-check what he says, what he does,\\u201d he said, adding that it was not the network\\u2019s role to \\u201cbuild up a campaign or take down a campaign.\\u201dThough CNN gives Democrats like Hillary Clinton multiple passes on a host of issues, Zucker insisted that CNN\\u2019s role is to be \\u201cskeptical of what every candidate says.\\u201d\\u00a0And though conservatives are presumed to be guilty until proven by the mainstream press in their questioning while Democrats are given every benefit of the doubt, Zucker said the \\u201ctone\\u201d of the reporters asking questions to politicians is what separates the great ones from the rest.Smith, along with many of his left-wing mainstream media colleagues, have been frustrated that Trump has continued to rise in the polls despite taking positions on illegal immigration and Islamic terrorism that the mainstream press abhor. Trump\\u2019s rise has rendered the mainstream media useless in shaping the 2016 election narrative, but the media continue to try to obliterate Trump by\\u00a0ramping up their attacks and accusing Trump of racism, bigotry, and even comparing him to Hitler.In the Washington Post this week, Dana Milbank wrote: \\u201cLet\\u2019s not mince words: Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist.\\u201dHe also attacked Trump\\u2019s supporters\\u2014claiming that \\u201cthough all Trump supporters surely aren\\u2019t racists or bigots, even a cursory examination of social media reveals that many are.\\u201d Milbank added that Trump, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, \\u201cdoes particularly well among white men who aren\\u2019t college-educated (24 percent) and white, non-evangelical Protestants (27 percent).\\u201dTo nobody\\u2019s surprise, Hillary Clinton\\u2014the press\\u2019s preferred candidate\\u2014also reportedly accused Trump this week of \\u201cmaking racism and hatred the hallmarks of his campaign.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 290140}"
