"{\"article_id\": 166449, \"content\": \"In an interview with the BBC\\u2019s Daily Politics (above), Mr. Lammy, who has previously been mocked for claiming the Vatican\\u2019s method for choosing a new Pope is \\u2018racist\\u2019 for using black and white smoke \\u2013 claimed in an interview with the UK Independence Party\\u2019s Steven Woolfe MEP, that Commonwealth soldiers who were fighting alongside British troops were actually fighting for the European Union.Mr. Woolfe said, \\u201cWe had two and a half million Indians who fought for us in the Second World War,\\u201d to which Mr. Lammy replied: \\u201cYou said it! A million Indians died fighting for us. The fought for the European project.Mr. Woolfe looked amazed, and asked, \\u201cDid you just say they fought for the European project?\\u201dMr. Lammy replied: \\u201cThey fought for the European project\\u201d.Mr Woolfe clarified: \\u201cThey fought for Britain to get rid of a European dictator who was murdering and killing people. They didn\\u2019t fight for the European Union. They didn\\u2019t fight for the European Economic Community. This is a complete perversion of history and what they were fighting for\\u201d.In fact that only place planning a European super state at the time were the Nazi Party of Germany.\\u00a0Dr Walther Funk, the Nazi economics minister, laid\\u00a0down plans for a post-war Europ\\u00e4ische Wirtschafts Gemeinschaft, or \\u2018European Economic Community\\u2019.Around 87k Indian Army died during WW2 not 1m as stated by @DavidLammy (1.5-2.5m died due to famine & disease). Don't desecrate their memory\\u2014 Harbakhsh Grewal (@HarbakhshGrewal) January 26, 2016Mr. Woolfe told Breitbart London after the programme: \\u201cDavid Lammy\\u2019s comments are outrageous. The \\u2018in\\u2019 campaign trying to convince Britain to stay in the European Union have their heads in the clouds\\u201d.I have to say @steven_woolfe of UKIP showed a surprisingly better understanding of BME Issues than @DavidLammy https://t.co/jtRwHoXw3d\\u2014 Captain Scarlett (@YohanesScarlett) January 26, 2016The news comes just a day after the leader of the \\u2018Britain Stronger in Europe\\u2019 campaign claimed that he voted to stay in the European Union in Britain\\u2019s referendum of 1975. There was no such referendum in 1975, but rather, a referendum on Britain\\u2019s membership of the European Common Market \\u2013 a trade organisation, rather than a political union with a President, and a parliament.I know David Lammy is not the smartest tool in the Labour box but he was ridiculous & offensive on @daily_politics  #BBCDP\\u2014 Kulgan of Crydee (@KulganofCrydee) January 26, 2016Mr. Lammy once debated the Editor of Breitbart London, Raheem Kassam, on the BBC\\u2019s Free Speech programme, during which he claimed that Margaret Thatcher as prime minister closed more coal mines than any other Prime Minister. In fact, 211 pits were closed under Labour\\u2019s Harold Wilson, whereas just 154 were closed under Prime Minister Thatcher.Astonishing from David Lammy who tells @daily_politics that the Indian sub-continent war dead gave their lives for the EU.\\u2014 Martin David Sewell (@martindsewell) January 26, 2016@DavidLammy  Did you actually say Indian soldiers 'fought for the European project'? Absolutely mental,seek some help/medication ASAP.#BBCDP\\u2014 Chris Orange (@ChrisOrange1) January 26, 2016David Lammy has pushed me to voting for leave.
