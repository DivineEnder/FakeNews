"{\"title\": \"Brock: Enough opposition research to \\u2018knock Trump Tower down\\u2019\", \"content\": \"Voters are expressing unease about both major-party presidential candidates according to the Morning Consult/POLITICO Exit Poll.David Brock, in a Monday night speech to some of the biggest liberal donors in the country, boasted that his researchers had assembled a trove of opposition research on Donald Trump that Democrats could use to \\u201cknock Trump Tower down to the sub-basement.\\u201dSpeaking at a reception on the sidelines of the annual spring meeting of the Democracy Alliance liberal donor club at Santa Monica\\u2019s tony Fairmont Hotel, Brock said that Trump \\u201cwas not properly vetted by his rivals \\u2014 or by the press\\u201d during the Republican presidential primary.But Brock, who is a leading supporter of Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, said that his non-profit opposition research outfit American Bridge started researching Trump last July, and has unearthed some damning stuff.\\u201cWe sat on it all so as not to help the candidates who might have been stronger general election candidates,\\u201d Brock said, according to his prepared remarks, which American Bridge released to POLITICO.The group, which provides research to Democratic campaigns and party committees, is supported by some Democracy Alliance donors. And sources at the Democracy Alliance meeting said several influential donors attended his reception, including health care tech entrepreneur Paul Egerman, who is close to Elizabeth Warren, as well as Taco Bell heir Rob McKay and New York investor Donald Sussman.While Brock told the donors that American Bridge also had been building oppo files on other prospective Republican presidential nominees \\u2014 including Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan \\u2014 he paid special attention to the Manhattan real estate showman who is leading the GOP delegate race, warning: \\u201cTrump won\\u2019t be a cakewalk defeat\\u201d in a general election.\\u201cAmerican Bridge is building a database of all the regular people \\u2014 from unpaid vendors to harassed tenants to defrauded students at Trump University \\u2014 who got screwed over for one reason only,\\u201d said Brock. \\u201cThey took Trump at his word.\\u201dBrock asserted that, if Trump does win the GOP nomination \\u201ca bare-knuckles campaign is necessary\\u201d to brand him as a greedy. misogynistic racist, and \\u201ca danger to the Constitution, a menace to democracy, and a threat to the nation as a whole.\\u201dAmerican Bridge\\u2019s approach to attacking Cruz would be a more traditional \\u201cstraight-up ideological battle,\\u201d against a politician who \\u201cisn\\u2019t much more than a regional candidate,\\u201d Brock told the donors. It would involve casting the Texas senator as an extremist \\u201cwho wants to evict immigrant families, deny women access to health care, cut taxes for the rich and bomb the Middle East \\u2018until the sand glows.\\u2019\\u201dHe acknowledged that some Democrats have \\u201cjitters\\u201d over the prospect that Ryan, the House Speaker, who has vigorously denied interest in the GOP nomination, might nonetheless be convinced to accept it as a consensus candidate at an open convention.But Brock said his group had already been \\u201cdusting off the old Romney and Ryan research books from 2012,\\u201d and would work to brand Ryan as \\u201ca cookie-cutter career politician\\u201d whose policies would hurt the poor and women.Overall, Brock sounded almost gleeful about the general election odds for Democrats.Not only did he declare \\u201cwe are going to win this election,\\u201d but he predicted a potentially sweeping victory down ballot. He said \\u201cwe all have this unprecedented opportunity to build a sustainable progressive majority.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 73490}"
