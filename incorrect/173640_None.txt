"{\"title\": \"Climate Expert: Marxists, Global Warming Extremists Control Vatican\", \"content\": \"The Economist called the Heartland Institute \\u201cthe world\\u2019s most prominent think tank promoting skepticism about man-made climate change.\\u201dMonckton has held positions with the British press and in government, as a press officer at the Conservative Central Office in the UK, and as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\\u2019s policy advisor. In 1986, Monckton was among the first to advise the prime minister that \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d caused by carbon dioxide should be investigated. Monckton has since become a vocal advocate that global warming \\u2014\\u00a0subsequently\\u00a0called climate change, most recently\\u00a0camouflaged by\\u00a0the term \\u201csustainable development,\\u201d doesn\\u2019t exist.Lord Monckton told BNS co-hosts Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon and Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow that, judging by\\u00a0Hillary Clinton\\u2019s re-launch speech on Saturday in New York, he doesn\\u2019t expect her to give much attention to climate change\\u00a0 in her 2016 presidential run.The topic of climate change is \\u201cbeginning to smell like a Kipper\\u00a0that went behind the radiator and has been there too long,\\u201d Monckton jibed. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re going to play this very big. Obama\\u2019s done it because everything else he\\u2019s touched has failed.\\u201dMonckton believes the Obama administration is spending vast amounts of money on \\u201ctrashing their own economy by driving every steelworks and aluminum works overseas, by not allowing the development of the XL pipeline, interfering with fracking, and establishing a war on coal.\\u201d He contends that\\u00a0all of this has had \\u201ccatastrophic effects on the jobs of the very people that will be foolishly voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\\u201dBannon asked Monckton why does he believe Pope Francis is getting involved in the climate change movement, which he is about to justify in a Vatican encyclical this week.\\u00a0Monckton explained that if one looks at the book of Genesis (\\u201cwith dominion over the earth comes responsibility\\u201d) and heroes of the church like St. Francis of Assisi, taking care of the earth has always been \\u201cpart of established Catholic social teachings. Nothing new in any of that. But what happened was a communist managed to get control of the pontifical academies of sciences and social sciences\\u2014Bishop Marcelo S\\u00e1nchez Sorondo.\\u201dAccording to Monckton, Sorondo\\u00a0is an \\u201cout and out marxist who\\u00a0decided that climate change was useful to marxism.\\u201d Monckton said that Sorondo could care less whether climate change is\\u00a0true or not. He ignored information from the Vatican\\u2019s most influential scientists\\u00a0demonstrating that global warming was more theoretical than empirical.\\u00a0Francis, who was brought up in the Communist tradition of liberation theology in Latin America, encourages Sorondo. Previous popes like John Paul II and Benedict believed you have to let skeptics have their say. Pope Francis, Monckton argues, lets Sorondo dominate his head exclusively.Monckton further explained that Francis is influenced by\\u00a0extremist Professor John Schnellnhuber, founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who said in 2009 at a climate conference in Copenhagen that if we let global warming continue, six billion of the seven billion people on earth will be killed by it.Monckton said that Schnellnhuber will be standing by the side of Pope Francis when they announce the encyclical next week. \\u201cThe fact that Schnellnhuber is going to be there is an extremely bad sign,\\u201d he declared. The influence that Schnellnhuber may have had over the papal letter worries Monckton. The fact that he will be there next to the pope suggests to Monckton that Francis is thanking him for having written the climate portion of the encyclical.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 173640}"
