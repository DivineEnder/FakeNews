"{\"title\": \"Kim Kardashian Tweets Wrong Dates for L.A. Highway Closure to Eight Million Followers, But I Blame the Mayor\", \"content\": \"One news item that was mostly lost in the holiday weekend shuffle was that the Los Angeles Police Department has solicited celebrities to use twitter to spread the word about the closure of a prominent freeway.   The story was already pretty funny, then Kim Kardashian tweeted the wrong information\\u2026 twice.   From Fox News:\\n\\nProbably not this.Kim Kardashian, one of several celebrities with Twitter followings in the millions, was asked by the L.A.P.D to warn her followers of the impending highway closure.Kardashian complied, tweeting on Friday:  \\u201cRemember this weekend the 405 Fwy is gonna be closed between the San  Fernando Valley and the West Side!!\\u201dJust one problem. The closure is in two weeks.So the \\u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\\u201d star tried to correct her mistake, tweeting: \\u201cRemember next weekend the 405 Fwy is gonna be closed between the San Fernando Valley and the West Side!!\\u201dWrong again.Kardashian erased both initial Twitter  messages and finally got it right: \\u201cStay away from the 405 Fwy the  weekend of July 16 & 17, it will be closed btwn the 10 Fwy and 101  Fwy North & South!\\u201dOh. My. Gawd.My data isn\\u2019t fresh on this, but there was a time not long ago where the stretch of 405 freeway between the 10 and 101 was the single most trafficked road in the United States.   Shutting that down for a couple of days is like blocking off L.A.\\u2019s pulmonary artery; it just can\\u2019t function without it.   So, if the city is going to try to temporarily block it off, they can\\u2019t afford any mistakes.One of the main theses of Big Hollywood is that more often than not, pop culture trumps politics; in other words, Hollywood has as much, if not more influence over the way we live our lives than those who are literally in power.   One of the best illustrations of this is twitter, where most of our country\\u2019s greatest thinkers are followed by a few thousand people while reality television stars and pop singers are followed by millions.   Kardashian, for example, who was catapulted to fame when a bootleg sex tape she made with rapper Ray-J was leaked to the public, is followed by over eight million people. By virtue of that fact, the LA City government entrusted her to disseminate vital information to help keep one of the country\\u2019s largest municipalities moving at it\\u2019s already lumbering pace.   Naturally, she wasn\\u2019t up to the task.But I don\\u2019t blame Kim Kardashian; she makes a living having her butt x-rayed. I blame all of us who have been suckered into the cult of celebrity and vote for the people who run this city so horribly.   The taxes are too high, our schools are unusable, and even the public restroom toilet seats have gang inscriptions carved into them.   And don\\u2019t try and drive anywhere in L.A., either, because if you don\\u2019t pop a tire on one of the countless potholes, I can only conceptualize an L.A. traffic jam as the preview for Hell.   The city is run by a goof-ball Mayor who changed his name from Tony Villar to Antonio Villaraigosa (no doubt to pander to the Latin community) and failed the Bar Exam all four times he took it.   When he\\u2019s not on top of a Telemundo reporter (no wonder he\\u2019s happy to turn the key of the city over to an amateur porn star) he\\u2019s court-side at a Laker game or violating a local variance.   This is the guy we democratically elected to be in charge, so we deserve whatever we get from him.We now have a city that has been left to the most incompetent people in the country (reality television stars) by the second most incompetent people in the country (left-wing politicians).Needless to say, it\\u2019s a bit of hyperbole to blame this twitter mishap on our failure of a Mayor; he may not have had much to do with any of this.   But someone was elected to run this city\\u2013it ain\\u2019t one of the Kardashians\\u2013and the buck stops with him.I love Los Angeles for a number of reasons, but the combination of Hollywood nonsense and a left-wing government can be a heavy burden to bear.   If you want to understand why our John Nolte left L.A., look no further than Kim Kardashian\\u2019s twitter feed.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 188730}"
