"{\"title\": \"Economist: Hillary 100% Wrong, 'World without Inequality Is Life of Unrelenting Drudgery'\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"The Political Economy editor at Forbes and editor of RealClearMarkets argues that everyone can be an economist and a good one too. He told listeners of Breitbart News Sunday airing on Sirius XM Patriot radio, channel 125, that economics boils down to Taxes, Regulation, Trade, and Money. Moreover, if our leaders could get these four concepts right, economic growth would soar.Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News and host of the show referred to Tamny as a \\u201cpure free markets guy.\\u201d He asked the editor what gave him the idea of making an economics book that a high school student can understand.\\u201cI wrote an accessible book precisely because economics is so accessible. Nothing could be easier than economic growth. It offends me that economists would put this in terms of graphs and charts,\\u201d he told Bannon. Tamny believes that this type of rendering of economics is a waste of people\\u2019s time and its turning them away from the \\u201cwonders of capitalism\\u2026\\u00a0It\\u2019s all very simple and shame on economists for making what is easy all very difficult.\\u201dWhen talking about taxes Tamny prefers to talk to you about the migration of the Rolling Stones. He\\u00a0tells us to think of taxes as a penalty for working. If Great Britain raises Mick Jagger\\u2019s income tax rate high enough, the Rolling Stones are going to find somewhere else to live, and the amount of taxes Great Britain collects from Mick will be zero.When the income tax rate got to 83% and the capital gains to 98%, Keith Richards said in his memoirs \\u201cthat was the equivalent of being told to leave the country.\\u201d When you tax the rich, argues Tamny, the rich will move. The Rollings Stones moved to France and then the United States, Tamny pointed out.Unfortunately, the net result is\\u00a0the poor or the middle class end up\\u00a0suffering.\\u00a0All the people who were going to cater to the Rolling Stones albums, the sound engineers, studio muscians, and other supporters lose their income and liveleyhood. \\u201cWhen you over tax the rich you end by definition reducing the economic chances of the non-rich, the poor, and the middle class.\\u201dWhen talking regulations the economist argues that the smartest people and the talent in any industry aren\\u2019t the regulators, they\\u2019re the people making a living at it.\\u201cRegulation is based on the fantasy that the mediocre can effectively direct the best and brightest. That\\u2019s like expecting the Appalachian State football team to beat Michigan every time they play,\\u201d he contends. In 2007 Div II Appalachian State beat the Div I Wolverines and is considered to be the greatest upset in NCAA football. \\u201cRegulations have rarely or ever worked. All they do is slow down businesses from achieving profits. And that\\u2019s what holds back job creations, company growth, and all the things that we want\\u2026 There\\u2019s no telling the amount of wealth that is destroyed every year and for decades due to regulations.\\u201dIn his book Tamny argues that economists and politicians are the biggest barrier to economic growth. \\u201cEconomic growth is easy. Just remove the barriers to production among talented people and let them thrive and they will do so\\u201d he insists. Tamny maintains that if economists have to use charts and graphs it proves that they can\\u2019t explain the concepts.The current gridlock in Washington is a good thing, Tamny informs, because it prevents politicians from making change. When politicians get involved they tend to make things worse. Tamney gives credit to the American electorate for voting in the gridlock at the polls, which proves that they \\u00a0do not trust either party.Gridlock and a strong dollar are two major reasons Tamny feels that the economy for now is doing better. He points to the success of Wall Street the last few years as a product of gridlock. \\u201cLook at what the stock market has done since 2010. It soared because when the government is doing less, the real economy can grow,\\u201d he stated.\\u201cHow do you create business and jobs? It\\u2019s through investments. What are investors buying when they invest? They are buying future dollars. A stronger dollar is luring investors back into productive activity and that is going to pay off down the line,\\u201d Tamny \\u00a0explained.Bannon asked Tamny, is Hillary Clinton correct that income inequality is bad for the country. \\u201cMy book proves her 100% wrong. I can\\u2019t think of anything more beautiful, more full of life, more pro-happiness than income inequality. It\\u2019s what powers the world forward.\\u201d he replied. \\u201cEvery time that inequality grows the lifestyle gap shrinks.\\u201d Tamny instructs that it is inequality that promoted technological achievements such as the cell phones, laptop computers, and other innovations that bring the information of all the libraries in the world to everyone\\u2019s instant disposal.\\u201cInequality drives down the prices of everything,\\u201d he emphasized.Tamny asked,Is the NFL weakened because Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady are better passers than other quarterbacks in the NFL? No it is greater because of it. Are we as individuals weakened when we pursue the skills that most animate our talents? Is a school weakened because some people are great at debating, some are good at math and others good at throwing a football? No that\\u2019s how we get to do what we\\u2019re best at. A world without inequality is a cruel, unhappy world. And it\\u2019s one we live lives of unrelenting drudgery. Everyone\\u2019s equal in Bangladesh. In the U.S. everyone gets to enjoy for the most part a much enhanced life precisely because rich genius people like the late Steve Jobs are creating interesting things for them.\", \"article_id\": 280458}"
