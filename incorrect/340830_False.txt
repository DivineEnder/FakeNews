"{\"content\": \"{\\\"A recently installed sign in a West End Avenue park has answered the mystery of the runic stones visible from West 64th Street. They once served asan embankment for the Hudson River Railroad tracks.\\\",\\\"Unfortunately \\u2014 for newspaper historians, at least \\u2014 the sign makes no mention of whatelsewas on the site from 1959 to 1975: an enormous printing plant that was intended to be the foundation of a new headquarters for The New York Times.\\\",\\\"At the time, The Times was quartered in a 15-story building at 229 West 43rd Street that it had constructed in 1913 and expanded three times. It made for implausible and, at times, almost impossible logistics. The newspaper was, in essence, operating a factory around the clock in the most densely populated entertainment district in America.\\\",\\\"Because of limited storage capacity in the building, newsprint had to be trucked in constantly. Tractor-trailers had to jackknife into docks on the street. Throughout the night, the process was reversed, as delivery trucks sped copies of the papers to homes, newsstands, railway stations and airports. All the while, thousands of people swarmed around the active loading bays, on their way to restaurants, movies, Broadway shows and more illicit pleasures.\\\",\\\"In contrast, the 8.3-acre site on the edge of the New York Central\\u2019s 60th Street Yard promised wide-open space and a logistical dream.\\\",\\\"\\u201dThe choice of the site was determined by two factors: first, the availability of railroad sidings to obtain direct delivery of rail-borne newsprint, and second, the relative freedom from the traffic congestion which slows down both incoming newsprint and outgoing newspaper deliveries at the present plant,\\u201d the Times Company\\u2019s 1957 annual report stated.\\\",\\\"The plant at 101 West End Avenue included both a new building, designed by Eggers &amp; Higgins, and an existing Chrysler garage that was renovated to store rolls of newsprint. The steel footings for the new low-rise building were engineered to be robust enough to support a 20-story tower above.Construction began in 1957and lasted two years.\\\",\\\"At 1:02 a.m. on July 28, 1959, 33-year-old Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, then the assistant treasurer of The Times, pushed the starter button at the West End plant. After the pressmen satisfied themselves that the slow flow of newsprint was unimpeded, an order was given to \\u201clet go,\\u201d and the presses roared to life, printing 1,450 copies of The Times in their initial run.\\\",\\\"By then, it was 3:45 in the morning. Dozens of men were emerging from the basement plant into the otherwise quiet streets. \\u201cA police car pulled up to the curb,\\u201d Times Talk, the house organ, reported. \\u201c \\u2018What\\u2019s going on?\\u2019 the sergeant asked Barney Dolan, the watchman. Barney explained that the plant had gone into production that night. \\u2018Oh,\\u2019 said the sergeant. \\u2018We thought it was a floating crap game.\\u2019 \\u201d\\\",\\\"As 1959 came to a close, a \\u201csubstantial part of the Sunday edition\\u201d was being printed in the plant, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher, reported. \\u201cEventually,\\u201d he added, \\u201cthe entire operation of The Times will be moved to this new site, but we have no definition of the word \\u2018eventually.\\u2019 \\u201d\\\",\\\"Eventually never came.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTractor-trailers could not turn around in the narrow driveways; there was no room to stack the giant rolls of newsprint efficiently,\\u201d Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones wrote in \\u201cThe Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times\\u201d (1999). \\u201cThe press conveyors were the longest in the business and broke down constantly. \\u2018From a technological point of view, the building was a disaster,\\u2019 said Mike Ryan, who oversaw the facility as assistant general manager.\\u201d\\\",\\\"By 1975, the plant was in need of a significant upgrade. And Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, by then the publisher of The Times, said, \\u201cThe economics of the full move to the site cannot now be justified.\\u201d Instead, the newspaper opened a new satellite printing plant in Carlstadt, N.J., andgranted the Trump Organization an option to buythe West End property.\\\",\\\"The park with the railroad stones now occupies the south half of the site. An apartment tower at the north half of the site has preserved at least one thing from the old Times plant. It is101 West End Avenue.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 340830, \"title\": \"1959-75 | The Rise and Fall of the West (Side)\"}"
