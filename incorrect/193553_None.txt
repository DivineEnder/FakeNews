"{\"title\": \"UN, Relief Workers Contradict Obama: Yazidi Crisis Far from Over\", \"content\": \"Vian Dakhail, the Yazidi parliamentarian who made global headlines earlier this month for her impassioned plea that someone protect her people from genocidal slaughter at the hands of ISIS terrorists besieging remnants of the ancient religious minority who had escaped massacre by fleeing into the wilderness of Iraq\\u2019s Mount Sinjar, said of Obama\\u2019s claim that the crisis was over, \\u201cIt\\u2019s just not true. It is just not true at all.\\u201dDakhail made her comments from a hospital bed where she was recovering from injuries sustained when the helicopter she was traveling in to deliver relief supplies crashed Tuesday. \\u201cIt is just not true that all of them are safe,\\u201d she said. Dakhail recoiled at Obama\\u2019s claim that \\u201conly a few thousand\\u201d refugees remained stranded on Mount Sinjar and that they \\u201cwere no longer starving.\\u201dShe, together with officials from the UN and leading relief agencies working the catastrophe, estimated the number of trapped Yazidis stood between 70,000 and 80,000 and suggested that 18 members of the small US special forces who spent only a few hours on the mountain and have already left Iraq conducted their hurried search for refugees on the wrong side of the mountain.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees corroborates Dakhail\\u2019s figure of 80,000 refugees who have fled onto Mount Sinjar as a result of the ISIS advance.Officials claim the vast majority of those trapped are located on the southern flank of the 60-mile-long east-west range, whereas the escape routes to safety are located on the northern edge of Mount Sinjar. \\u201cConditions\\u201d, said Dakhail, on \\u201cthe south side of the mountain [remain] very terrible.\\u201dDakhail\\u2019s bleak assessment of the situation on Mt. Sinjar was categorically supported by United Nations officials in the region. David Swanson, the spokesman for the UN coordinator of humanitarian affairs in Northern Iraq, told the New York Times, \\u201cThe crisis on Mt. Sinjar is by no means over.\\u201d \\u201cAlthough many people managed to escape from the northern side,\\u201d he said, \\u201cthere are still thousands of others up there under conditions of extreme heat, dehydration, and imminent threat of attack.\\u201d \\u201cThe situation\\u201d, he said, \\u201cis far from resolved.\\u201d\\u201cWe have multiple, both primary and secondary, sources coming in,\\u201d Swanson continued. \\u201cThis is day 12 and the crisis is far from over.\\u201dDakhail suggested that the American assessment operation purposely avoided the southern side of Mt. Sinjar to prevent the US forces from coming within range of ISIS anti-aircraft fire. The southern face of Mt. Sinjar is the area with the greatest problems for refugees precisely due to their exposure to ISIS forces.Kieran Dyer, another spokesman for the UN\\u2019s humanitarian coordinator\\u2019s office, said, \\u201cWe aren\\u2019t doing a military assessment. We are doing a humanitarian assessment, and from a humanitarian perspective,\\u201d he said, \\u201cthe situation remains grave.\\u201dOn Thursday, President Obama took to a grammar school on Martha\\u2019s Vineyard to tell a national television audience that \\u201cthe bottom line is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved\\u201d and that therefore Americans should \\u201cnot expect there to be an additional operation to get people off the mountain.\\u201dThe President, who used his statement about Iraq to also call upon local law enforcement in Ferguson, Missouri, to demonstrate \\u201cgreater transparency\\u201d in dealing with journalists attempting to cover the ongoing racial violence there, refused to take questions from the press before returning directly to the Farm Neck Golf Club in Oaks Bluff, Massachusetts, for another afternoon round.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 193553}"
