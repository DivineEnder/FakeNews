"{\"title\": \"Interview: Utah Sheriff Stands Up to BLM\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"The confrontation was most certainly heating up as the protest drew near. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that two people in a pick-up truck confronted a BLM wrangler off Interstate 15. Driving by wearing hoods, the men held up a sign that read, \\u201cYou need to die,\\u201d and one of the men pointed a hand gun at the wrangler. The BLM wranglers were participating in a highly controversial round-up of wild horses and burros. The BLM said they believe the incident was more about the BLM\\u2019s recent news status than the round-up program.San Juan County Sheriff Rick Eldridge decided to intervene to prevent further escalation of the situation in the lead up to last weekend\\u2019s protest event. Working closely with the BLM and militia members, Sheriff Eldridge helped avoid a large show of force from the BLM that might have escalated the protest into something resembling the stand-off in Henderson, NV.The Las Vegas Sun reported Sheriff Eldridge said in a public statement, \\u201cSan Juan County Sheriff\\u2019s deputies will be at the event in Recapture Canyon on Saturday, May 10th. Our deputies will be there to keep the peace and protect the Constitutional rights of everyone involved. We feel this will be a peaceful event and encourage everyone to be respectful to one another and allow individuals to exercise their First Amendment right.\\u201dSheriff Eldridge joined Breitbart Texas for an exclusive telephone interview to discuss this incident, the issues between the BLM and locals who seek a different use of the land, and his role as a \\u201cConstitutional Sheriff.\\u201dEldridge began by describing the situation he was facing in the Recapture Canyon protest. \\u201cComing off the heels of Bunker Hill, Nevada,\\u201d Eldridge explained, \\u201cwhere the Bundy\\u2019s had this experience with the BLM, we were very worried this same scenario could play out in San Juan County, Utah. We had a County Commissioner that was planning on going down a closed trail that is on public land managed by the BLM.\\u201d\\u201cObviously,\\u201d Eldridge continued, \\u201cthe BLM was involved and had issued warnings that they would write him a ticket if they were to go down this trail. We figured, with that, there may be some militia members that would show up.\\u00a0 Of course we had our own citizens there and we did not want a clash between citizens and the BLM.\\u201dRyan Payne, a Montana resident who spent several weeks at the Bundy Ranch incident and dealt with the Clark County, NV, sheriff and the BLM at that location told the Las Vegas Sun that dealing with Sheriff Eldridge\\u2019s stance was \\u201c180 degrees\\u201d different.Breitbart Texas asked Sheriff Eldridge if that is because he believes that part of his role as sheriff is to be a \\u201cConstitutional Sheriff\\u201d or, in other words, the chief defender of the U.S. Constitution in the county. Eldridge responded, \\u201cI do. Of course, I thought every sheriff was a \\u2018Constitutional Sheriff\\u2019. I mean, that\\u2019s why we get in the business, to protect the rights of our citizens.\\u201d Sheriff Eldridge is in his first term as San Juan County Sheriff and has not yet joined the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. In the full audio interview below, Sheriff Eldridge explains in more detail about the negotiations with the BLM to help ensure the peace and that all citizens\\u2019 First Amendment rights were protected, as well as their safety. He also explains the land management issues related to Recapture Canyon and other federally managed lands in Utah.\\u00a0 Breitbart Texas previously reported on BLM issues in Grand County, Utah. Breitbart Texas also reported the issue of the potential land grab by the BLM along the Red River boundary between Texas and Oklahoma.Follow Bob Price on Twitter\\u00a0@BobPriceBBTX.\", \"article_id\": 147169}"
