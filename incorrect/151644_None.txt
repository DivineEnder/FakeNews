Key institutions, including the judiciary, police and army, have collapsed in some major cities including Benghazi and Derna,\\u201d HRW added. \\u201cOfficials are powerless to maintain security, or to apprehend or prosecute those who commit crimes, including murders and assassinations. Militia members have benefited from near immunity against prosecution since 2011, and very few cases have gone to court.\\u201dU.S.-backed militias toppled Gaddafi in October 2011.Since then, conflict has engulfed the country as rival governments and powerful militias battle each other for territory.The Islamic State and al-Qaeda maintain a presence in the North African country.\\u201cThe elected government of Libya as well as non-state actors and members of militias are bound by international law obligations to protect journalists, as much as they are bound to protect civilians, during armed conflicts,\\u201d proclaimed HRW in the report.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 151644}"
