"{\"title\": \"Trailer Talk: Pixar's 'Cars 2' Arrives June 24th\", \"content\": \"\\u2014\\u2013The original \\u201cCars\\u201d is considered something of a redheaded stepchild in the Pixar world, and I think I understand why. The scope of the picture isn\\u2019t like the others. The story\\u2019s mostly set in a very small town as opposed to other Pixar classics that tend to expand their concepts on to a much bigger and wider canvas. Having only seen \\u201cCars\\u201d at home as opposed to the theatre, I actually found that the  smaller, toned-down scale was one of the film\\u2019s many charms. And when you consider the culture we live in today, where Hollywood frequently sneers at small town America and its values, it was refreshing to see a sympathetic portrayal of   that world.Obviously, if the trailer is any indication, \\u201cCars 2\\u201d intends to blow open its scope in a major way, which is probably a good idea. Someone told me the reason Pixar was so eager to make a \\u201cCars\\u201d sequel was due to the merchandising. The film itself might not have done \\u201cToy Story 3\\u201d business, but the \\u201cCars\\u201d merchandise was through the roof.But who really cares why they made the sequel? Pixar is the flawless gem of the film world today; the one reliable bright spot in an otherwise disappointing and ridiculously unreliable universe. Whatever their motives, whatever their reasons, the only thing I care about is that Pixar keeps on keeping on \\u2014 keeps on proving that great stories combined with universal, uplifting themes will translate into  boffo box office.\\u201cCars 2\\u201d opens June 24th.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 189111}"
