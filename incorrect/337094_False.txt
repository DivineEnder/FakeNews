About 1,350 prospective jurors in theTsarnaev casefilled out screening questionnaires; Judge George A. O\\u2019Toole Jr. of Federal District Court had planned to start the questioning of individual jurors on Thursday.\\\",\\\"The request for a delay is not the defense team\\u2019s first; it had asked at least twice before for a delay, saying it was overwhelmed by the huge number of documents from the government. It also sought to move the trial out of Boston, saying Mr. Tsarnaev could not get a fair trial here. All such requests were denied, and jury selection began Jan. 5.\\\",\\\"The defense motion on Tuesday cited numerous news media accounts that drew comparisons between the initial terrorist attack in Paris that killed 12 people and the 2013 marathon bombings, which killed three and wounded more than 260.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe supposed parallels included the fact that the suspects were brothers, that they reportedly were influenced by the lectures and writings of Anwar al-Awlaki, that they were \\u2018homegrown\\u2019 terrorists, and that they attacked civilians in a Western city,\\u201d the defense wrote.\\\",\\\"Representative William Keating, Democrat of Massachusetts, was quoted byUSA Todayas saying: \\u201cI\\u2019m watching what\\u2019s happening in Paris, and I\\u2019m thinking of Watertown,\\u201d a reference to lockdowns of suburban neighborhoods during sprawling manhunts to find the suspects.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThese parallels so widely expressed cannot be lost on potential jurors,\\u201d the defense wrote.\\\",\\\"\\u201cEven before the Paris attacks,\\u201d the defense added, \\u201cthere was no modern precedent of which we are aware for attempting to seat an impartial jury in a community that had been so recently, so grievously, and so widely affected by a single series of crimes. Now, at the very moment that this attempt is to be made, the Boston bombings are being newly placed at the center of a grim global drama.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
