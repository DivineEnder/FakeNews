"{\"title\": \"Egyptian Media: Country's Religious Authority Is Cultivating Extremism\", \"content\": \"Egypt\\u2019s official daily Al Ahram ran a column by Ahmad Abd Al-Tawab who claimed that the recent wave of attacks against the country\\u2019s Coptic community were the result of the Al Azhar authority\\u2019s extremist curricula.Al-Tawab lamented that taxpayer funds are being used for Al Azhar universities\\u2019 \\u201cpoisonous curricula\\u201d so that ultimately \\u201csociety pays to train, educate and cultivate a group [of graduates] that hates society and is hostile to it and attacks it as it pleases!\\u201d he wrote in the article translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).Al-Tawab goes on to say that anyone who dares to question Al Azhar is attacked with accusations of heresy and some even end up behind bars.In a second, equally harsh, article, Al-Tawab addresses the uniform sermon crisis, claiming that Al-Azhar has done everything to sabotage the cause despite its proclamations of support.The sermon policy, introduced by Egypt\\u2019s Ministry of Religious Endowments, called for uniform Friday sermons in ministry-funded mosques across the country that would require preachers to deliver a prepared sermon provided to them by the ministry.The initiative was part of Sisi\\u2019s strategy to combat extremist Islamic ideology and to stop sermons from dealing with political matters. However, the initiative sparked fiery resistance from Al-Azhar, which claimed it ran contrary to Islamic practice.Since Al-Azhar is a crucial support base for Sisi, the president ultimately acquiesced and intervened on the authority\\u2019s behalf. The Minister of Religious Endowments, Mohamed Mokhtar Gomaa, backtracked and according to MEMRI, said his ministry would not be providing sermons but would only determine the topic of the sermons and its length.Al-Tawab slammed the developments, saying that while \\u201cAl Azhar\\u2019s clerics were quick to welcome the president\\u2019s call for a [religious] revolution, it was never translated into action on the ground.\\u201dOn the contrary, writes Al-Tawab, Al Azhar has instead \\u201cmercilessly attacked anyone with a differing opinion without hesitating to use the weapon of accusations of heresy, or to file lawsuits that placed several people behind bars.\\u201dAl-Tawab claimed that Egypt desperately needs to \\u201cinstitute a constitution that lays the foundations for a modern state\\u201d which would include defending freedoms, including \\u201cfreedom of worship, of scientific research, of literary and artistic creativity,\\u201d and by strengthening the country\\u2019s ties with other nations.The columnist says that efforts to combat religious extremist ideology on the internet are futile since they are treating the symptoms without addressing the cause.Instead, he claims, the country needs to invest its resources into reforming education curricula \\u201cthat still contains horrifying expressions\\u201d of extremism, as well as to purge the country of extremists in senior positions of authority.The country also needs to find ways to improve teachers by \\u201cadapting them to the spirit of the times\\u201d and to enforce state law in incidents of conflict, such as with the Coptic community, instead of allowing traditional Islamic law to handle such incidents.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 313357}"
