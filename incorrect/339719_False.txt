"{\"title\": \"Sheldon Silver, Unbowed by Charges, Adjusts to Life After the Speakership\", \"content\": \"{\\\"ALBANY \\u2014 The last five months have not been kind toSheldon Silver. Arrested in January,indicted in Februaryand forced out as Assembly speaker in between, Mr. Silver has seen his influence in the Capitol wane.\\\",\\\"Some luxuries have been lost, like the office just off the Assembly floor. He now sits in the chamber, next to a freshman Democrat who was 14 years old when Mr. Silver was first elected to the Assembly.\\\",\\\"Yet in many ways, Mr. Silver remains a presence unbowed, tackling favored causes and displaying no obvious reluctance about appearing in public at the Capitol or elsewhere.\\\",\\\"At the Celebrate Israel parade in Manhattan last month, for instance, he marched up Fifth Avenue wearing a blue sash and holding up an Israeli flag. Outside City Hall in March, he voiced support for making the Lunar New Year a school holiday.\\\",\\\"At an April meeting of a task force he formed to address the issue of school overcrowding, those on hand greeted him with applause. \\u201cThese are my friends,\\u201d Mr. Silver said last week, recalling the warm reception. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been doing this with them for 30 years. As far as they\\u2019re concerned, nothing\\u2019s changed.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He is even taking small, principled stands, voting against bills that strike him as unwise \\u2014 including a proposal to allow dogs within the outdoor dining areas of restaurants.\\\",\\\"Last week, Mr. Silver mounted a campaign against a move to hold New York\\u2019s 2016 presidential primary on a date that falls duringPassover, recruiting colleagues to sign a letter to the Democratic National Committee stating their opposition.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m here doing my work,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMy constituents elected me to do a job, and I\\u2019m going to do that job as long as I\\u2019m representing them. And if I wasn\\u2019t going to do that job, then I would leave.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Silver, 71, began the year as the most powerful Democrat in the State Legislature and one of Albany\\u2019s \\u201cthree men in a room.\\u201d But afterhis arrest, his fellow Democrats decided he could no longer continue as the speaker. Mr. Silverstepped down, ending a reign as leader that spanned more than two decades.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe\\u2019s no longer a man in power, but in terms of his demeanor, there doesn\\u2019t appear to be any major anger or bitterness,\\u201d said Assemblyman James F. Brennan, a Brooklyn Democrat. \\u201cI\\u2019m sure he would rather be speaker, but his demeanor is not a disgruntled, embittered man.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Silver, who is charged with obtaining illicit payments disguised as legitimate income from working as a lawyer, maintains his innocence and is scheduled to go on trial in November.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019ve hired lawyers, paid them, and they will do their job,\\u201d Mr. Silver said. \\u201cThey, as I, am pretty convinced I\\u2019ll be vindicated at the end of the process. And in the interim, I am doing my job. And if they need me, they call me.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Silver still must contend with the inevitable stares and snickers when he walks through the Capitol. Like other politicians indicted before him, he has become an Albany punch line: This year, at the annual satire show staged by the Capitol press corps, Michael Jackson\\u2019s \\u201cBeat It\\u201d was given a Silver-themed rewrite (with lyrics including \\u201cI\\u2019ll plead it, plead it, bet your tuchis I will plead it\\u201d).\\\",\\\"There is also this simple fact of life: Some people, especially politicians loath to be associated with scandal, do not enjoy being in the presence of, or photographed with, a person under federal indictment.\\\",\\\"Mr. Silver did offer one upside to his exile from leadership: The news media, he said, no longer seeks to scrutinize his every move. \\u201cI\\u2019m glad not to be in the headlines,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the one thing I don\\u2019t miss.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The awkwardness arising from the charges against him has not driven Mr. Silver to stay out of sight. When the Assembly worked late into the night to approve the state budget, he gamely chatted with reporters at the side of the chamber.\\\",\\\"He even turned up in the background ofphotosof Sawyer Fredericks, a winner of NBC\\u2019s \\u201cThe Voice\\u201d who was honored by the Assembly this month.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI see him at more receptions during the session as a regular member than he was as speaker,\\u201d Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Queens Democrat, said. \\u201cHe comes to everything.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Weprin, whose father, Saul, preceded Mr. Silver as speaker, said Mr. Silver had been a useful sounding board for members. \\u201cMost people would just say, after being speaker, \\u2018I\\u2019m just going to give up,\\u2019\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Assemblywoman Rebecca A. Seawright of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the freshman member who sits next to Mr. Silver, said he had helped her find her bearings. \\u201cFew know process and procedure better,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI have many questions and he has much patience.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As speaker, Mr. Silver was notoriously hard to read. As former speaker, that has not changed, including when it comes to his feelings about his diminished position. \\u201cI don\\u2019t see him going on \\u2018Oprah\\u2019 and talking about it, let\\u2019s put it that way,\\u201d Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Queens Democrat, said.\\\",\\\"Mr. Silver has good reason to remain active, especially in his Lower Manhattan district. If convicted, he would lose his seat; if acquitted, he would be up for re-election next year, and face the prospect of a primary challenge. Mr. Silver said he planned to seek another term.\\\",\\\"Since stepping down as speaker, he has become a member of the Assembly\\u2019s Education Committee. He introduced a bill to provide atax credit to families that pay private school tuition, and fielded questions on the Assembly floor about another bill he sponsored that wouldrequire food-inspection violations to be posted on a state website. The Assembly approved the legislation.\\\",\\\"As speaker, Mr. Silver controlled which bills the Assembly considered, so there was never a question about where he stood on those that came before it. Now, as a rank-and-file member, Mr. Silver must decide how to vote.\\\",\\\"He has developed a bit of a contrarian streak in a chamber where bills usually pass overwhelmingly. He voted, for instance, against allowing the extension of temporary increases to some local sales tax rates, calling the sales tax regressive.\\\",\\\"He voted in favor of a constitutional amendment that would allow legislators and other officials convicted on corruption charges to bestripped of their pensions. He abstained from voting on a bill to temporarily extend rent regulations and a housing program that gives tax breaks to developers; he said he did so because the tax-break program figured in the criminal case against him.\\\",\\\"Of his opposition to the so-calleddining with dogs bill, Mr. Silver said he had deferred to the concerns of the city\\u2019s health department, but he also cited personal experience.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI have a grandson who\\u2019s petrified of dogs,\\u201d he explained, while noting that some children are bitten by dogs at young ages and are fearful of them as a result.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTo put them in that position of having to confront a dog, even though the dog lies quietly on the floor, I don\\u2019t think is appropriate,\\u201d he said, suggesting, perhaps, that dogs be restricted to only a portion of outdoor dining areas.\\\",\\\"In two interviews last week, Mr. Silver seemed more at ease discussing legislative matters than his own circumstances. Asked if he thought he had been treated fairly since his arrest, he responded: \\u201cDo I really think so? No. But that\\u2019s O.K.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He offered a positive but terse assessment of the performance of his successor, Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat: \\u201cI think he\\u2019s done a great job.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Silver acknowledged that his life was different these days. When he was speaker, he said he was well aware that many of his friends would fade away once he was no longer among the state\\u2019s most powerful politicians.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019ve even said it to Carl,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou come into this job with 10 friends. Maybe you\\u2019ll leave with 11.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cBut while you\\u2019re in the job,\\u201d he continued, \\u201cyou\\u2019ll have 500.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 339719}"
