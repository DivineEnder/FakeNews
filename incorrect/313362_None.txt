"{\"title\": \"Leaked Memo: Soros Foundation Eyed Stronger Internet Regulation in TPP Negotiations\", \"content\": \"Soros\\u2019s organization does not appear to support the TPP outright, but expressed interest in influencing the sweeping internationalist treaty, including the treaty\\u2019s positions on Internet regulation.The document reveals the Foundations provided a grant to a Latin American group under the project title \\u201cPromotion of Human Rights Standards in Latin American Internet Regulation.\\u201d A description of the purpose of the grant, which was for $66,920, states a main goal was to impact TTP negotiations, especially related to Internet regulation in the draft international agreement.The funds, approved April 2013, were awarded to ONG Derechos Digitales, a nonprofit based in Chile focused on public interest and technology.In the \\u201cObjectives and Goals\\u201d section, the memo, referring to the TTP as the TTPA, states:Advocate for the protection of human rights standards in the Transpacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA): provide technical assistance to negotiators of Latin American countries (Chile, Peru, and Mexico) of the TPPA; raise awareness about the TPPA in the Spanish-speaking countries.The listed indicators that would prove the success of the grant includes \\u201cprotection of human rights standards in the TPPA; increased capacity of civil society in Latin America to influence internet regulation; a stronger network and better collaboration of civil society working on digital rights in Latin America.\\u201dThe information was contained in a document describing various grants titled, \\u201cCivil Liberties in the Digital Environment: Grant Recommendations for Core Grantees.\\u201dThe reference to influencing \\u201chuman rights standards\\u201d in the TPP actually seems to relate to a globalist treaty that impacts domestic law.\\u00a0 There too, the grant objectives referenced Internet regulation.The Foundations memo makes clear it was seeking to \\u201cinfluence legislation\\u201d in Latin American countries to ensure \\u201ccompliance with the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights.\\u201dIt relates:Over the past few years, the governments in Latin America have started to regulate the online environment, mainly driven by the need to implement trade agreements. That said, this \\u201cregulation trend\\u201d is set to further accelerate in the coming years as the internet penetration rate is predicted to jump over 50%. This presents a good opportunity for civil society to help set standards and influence legislation in compliance with the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights.The Inter-American Convention on Human Rights seeks to impose a system of universal human rights and rules, and it tasks governments with altering their own domestic laws to align with those of the Convention, including rules pertaining to property rights and the judicial system. \\u00a0Twenty-three Central and South American countries are currently members.In September 2013, Venezuela exited the pact, with President Hugo Ch\\u00e1vez claiming the Commission was \\u201ccampaigning against his government and acting at the behest of the United States.\\u201dThe preamble of the agreement states\\u00a0that the pact countries are \\u201cReaffirming their intention to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and social justice based on respect for the essential rights of man.\\u201dThe TPP, meanwhile, is an expansive trade agreement between 12 Pacific Rim countries, including the U.S. Obama has made the treaty a central part of his so-called pivot to Asia.Earlier this week, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Obama would push for the TPP to be passed before he leaves office in January. Earnest said the president would make the case for the treaty during a speech in Laos on Sept. 6.\\u201cThe president is going to make a strong case that we have made progress and there is a path for us to get this done before the president leaves office,\\u201d Earnest said.Soros himself has expressed\\u00a0tepid support for the TPP. Writing last year in the New York Review of Books, the billionaire called the TPP \\u201can excellent opportunity for a two-pronged strategy\\u201d to forge a partnership with China if the treaty could be amended not to exclude China. \\u00a0Soros opposed Obama\\u2019s request to fast-track the TPP past Congress, instead advocating for the treaty to be altered to help forge a strategic partnership with China.The Soros-funded Free Press organization has been\\u00a0a leading advocate for Internet regulation through \\u201cNet Neutrality.\\u201dAaron Klein is Breitbart\\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
