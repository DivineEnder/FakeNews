"{\"title\": \"From Book Publishers to the Media: The Left's Crusade to End Debate\", \"content\": \"A personal incident has given me a particular perspective on recent news about the media. Last Tuesday, I received word that the French release of my thriller novel Empire of Lies had been canceled by publisher Seuil Policiers. The editor who originally bought the book had left the French company, and the new editor, my agent says, feels that \\u201cshe can not publish . . . because of the political and religious aspects of the story.\\u201d This, even though it\\u2019s in breach of a contract for which I\\u2019ve been paid in full.\\n\\nEmpire of Lies features a politically conservative Christian protagonist, Jason Harrow, who believes he has uncovered an Islamist terrorist plot being obscured by the leftist mainstream media. \\u201cLies, lies, lies,\\u201d the emotionally troubled Harrow murmurs at his television set. \\u201cIt\\u2019s all about what they don\\u2019t say.\\u201d It will come as no surprise that my friend Andrew Breitbart praised the book as the only thriller he\\u2019d ever read in which the mainstream media were the villains.The book\\u2019s French cancellation is, I realize, a rather small cultural event.

Everywhere, the Left seeks to disappear its opposition, whereas the Right is willing to meet them head-on.Take the e-mails that the Daily Caller obtained from the now-defunct lefty Web service Journolist. Never mind the personal or psychological implications of a radio producer who lovingly imagines Rush Limbaugh\\u2019s death or a law professor who doesn\\u2019t know that the FCC has no power to deprive Fox News of a license or a reporter who wants to smear Fred Barnes and other right-wing commentators as racist in order to distract the public from the hateful radicalism of Jeremiah Wright, then Obama\\u2019s pastor. The point is not these people\\u2019s animus or ignorance or wickedness. The point is that what they desired was not victory in open debate but silence\\u2013the silence of censorship, intimidation, or the grave.Read the full article here.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 191005}"
