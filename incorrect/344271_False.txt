"{\"content\": \"{\\\"WASHINGTON \\u2014  The tax plans of the Republican presidential candidates would cut federal revenues as much as $12 trillion over a decade, a post-World War II record eclipsing the deep tax cuts of George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy. And they would come just as America faces the costs of its aging baby-boom generation.\\\",\\\"The combination of the tax cuts\\u2019 size and timing has many tax and budget policy analysts questioning their viability. The Republican rivals routinely denounce the current $14 trillion debt, but none has said how he would offset the revenues lost to his tax cuts, beyond unspecified cuts to domestic programs and repeals of some existing tax breaks.\\\",\\\"Each candidate has said his tax cuts are needed to promote work, saving, investment and faster economic growth.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI believe bycutting taxes and simplifying the tax code, we will grow our economy and create more taxpayers rather than more taxes,\\u201d SenatorMarco Rubioof Florida has said.\\\",\\\"Tax policy groups agree generally, but only if the revenue losses are offset by budget savings that avoid piling up more debt that would be counterproductive to spurring the economy.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe candidates need to present real specifics for how they would address our record levels of debt,\\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\\\",\\\"\\u201cMassive tax cuts and few specifics for what spending to reduce will only make the challenges much worse,\\u201d she added. \\u201cAnd miraculous growth projections and \\u2018waste, fraud and abuse\\u2019 are just not credible solutions.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Also, at a time when many Americans lament the growing gap between rich and poor \\u2014 and the shrinking middle class in between \\u2014 the Republicans\\u2019 plans would mostly benefit the richest individuals and corporations, according to analyses by research groups that lean left, right and center.\\\",\\\"What is indisputable is the sheer size of the proposed tax cuts. The four most detailed proposals would easily eclipse the reductions under Presidents Bush, Reagan and Kennedy, compared with the size of the economy.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe 2016 primary contenders make those guys look like pikers,\\u201d said the economist Leonard Burman, the director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington and a Treasury official in the Reagan and Clinton administrations.\\\",\\\"The center, using historical data from the Treasury Department, put the Kennedy tax cuts at 1.6 percent ofgross domestic product, the net Reagan reductions at 2.1 percent and the Bush cuts at 1.4 percent.Mr.Rubio\\u2019s tax cutswould equal 2.6 percent of the total economy, according to the Tax Policy Center, while those ofSenator Ted Cruz of Texaswould be 3.6 percent and thetax cuts proposed by Donald J. Trumpwould be 4 percent.\\\",\\\"By most estimates of the outside groups, thecostliest plan is Mr. Trump\\u2019s. His proposed cuts could mean about $12 trillion less in federal revenue in the first 10 years after they took effect \\u2014 a figure on which both a liberal tax policy group, Citizens for Tax Justice, and a conservative-leaning one, the Tax Foundation, agree. That would be more than a quarter of the $46.5 trillion in total revenues that the new Obama budget projects over 10 years.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019ll simplify the tax code. It\\u2019ll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn\\u2019t seen for decades,\\u201d Mr. Trump said in September, dismissing any concerns over cost.\\\",\\\"Citizens for Tax Justice says Mr. Rubio\\u2019s tax cuts would cost nearly as much as Mr. Trump\\u2019s, whilethose espoused by Mr. Cruzwould reduce federal revenue the most of all \\u2014 $16.2 trillion over a decade, or more than one-third of anticipated revenues.\\\",\\\"The Tax Policy Center, a joint research effort of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, estimatesthe Trump planwould lower revenues the most, $9.5 trillion over 10 years, followed byMr. Cruz\\u2019s plan($8.6 trillion) and theRubio proposal($6.8 trillion).\\\",\\\"Even the least of the loss estimates would mean a cost of nearly $4 trillion over the first decade \\u2014 the price tag that the Tax Foundation put on the Cruz plan. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, also have proposed deep tax cuts, but without enough detail for many economists to analyze in depth.\\\",\\\"The Tax Foundation has separate estimates showing that all the Republican plans would have lower budgetary losses if the economic growth they would spark was counted in the cost.\\\",\\\"However, \\u201cwe assume that the tax cuts are appropriately financed by, for example, spending reductions,\\u201d said Kyle E. Pomerleau, the director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation. \\u201cIt is certainly the case that having significant deficits well into the future would have an adverse impact on the economy.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Bidding wars on tax cuts among presidential candidates are nothing new, but the timing of the 2016 campaign is distinctive: The oldest baby boomers have reached retirement age and are now drawing benefits fromMedicare,Social Securityand, in many cases,Medicaid. This is making real a demographic and fiscal reckoning that economists have long projected would drive federal debt to unsustainable levels in the next decades.\\\",\\\"After the Tax Policy Center released its analysis for the Cruz plan last week, after those for the Trump and Rubio proposals, economists there spoke to the common threads linking the Republican tax proposals. (The center also analyzed the tax plan of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, wholeft the raceSaturday.)\\\",\\\"\\u201cOne, they are enormous tax cuts relative to anything we\\u2019ve done in the past,\\u201d said William Gale, an economist at Brookings. \\u201cTwo, the candidates don\\u2019t specify how they\\u2019re going to pay for these tax cuts.\\u201d He added, \\u201cAnd three, they are hugely regressive\\u201d \\u2014 that is, the higher a person\\u2019s income, the bigger the tax cuts that taxpayer would receive, both in dollars and as a percentage of income.\\\",\\\"If the candidates \\u201cever do get around to specifying how they\\u2019re going to pay for the tax cuts,\\u201d Mr. Gale added, the budget savings are \\u201cgoing to come from low- and middle-income households\\u201d because those Americans benefit more than the rich from the government\\u2019s domestic spending programs.\\\",\\\"What the Cruz and Rubio proposals also have in common is that, to varying degrees, they would shift from the century-old progressive income tax system \\u2014 which generally taxes wages and investments at rates that increase with taxpayers\\u2019 income \\u2014 to one focused on taxing consumption, and exempting investment income including dividends, capital gains and interest on savings. Mr. Cruz proposes both a 10 percent flat tax and a 16 percent consumption tax similar to a European-stylevalue-added tax.\\\",\\\"Many economists favor consumption taxes over income taxes because they provide incentives to save and invest. But critics counter that consumption taxes fall harder on lower-income wage earners, who can save little.\\\",\\\"Most of the Republican plans would also repeal estate and gift taxes, thealternative minimum taxand taxes on the rich that Mr. Obama signed into law to finance hishealth care law. Those changes, and lower tax rates, explain why the wealthiest taxpayers would see significantly bigger tax cuts than most Americans under the proposals.\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 344271, \"title\": \"Analysts Question Viability of Deep Tax Cuts Proposed by Republican Candidates\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
