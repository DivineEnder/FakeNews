"{\"content\": \"{\\\"For Kate Sokoloff, a brand strategist in Portland, Ore., theFacebookmirror of her breakup with her boyfriend of three years was like \\u201can emotional sucker punch,\\u201d she said. \\u201cNot 15 minutes after we broke up four years ago, and probably while he was still parked outside of my house, he changed his status to \\u2018single.\\u2019\\u201d\\\",\\\"This meant that all of the couple\\u2019s Facebook friends, including her teenage sons, were instantly notified. \\u201cThere was no hiding or time to cry on my own,\\u201d said Ms. Sokoloff, now 55.\\\",\\\"She did message friends, asking them to remove any photos of herself and her former partner from their own Facebook albums, but she remembers wishing \\u201cthere was a Facebook vacuum cleaner that could suck every trace of our relationship off the Internet. Photos, in particular. In fact, some just popped up yesterday.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Since last November, there has been such a tool, part of a kit the social network has designed to manage and curate the digital archive that is growing with each relationship. It\\u2019s like cleaning your closet, said Kelly Winters, a product manager on Facebook\\u2019s designated \\u201cCompassion Team,\\u201d a changing squad of product managers and designers, engineers, researchers, social scientists and psychologists. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to keep anything around that doesn\\u2019t spark joy,\\u201d she said, echoing the mantra of Marie Kondo, the Japanese decluttering guru.\\\",\\\"Three million users have already deployed some aspect of the breakup flow, as it\\u2019s called, by choosing to minimize what they see of an ex going forward, and similarly hide their own postings, settings that can easily be reversed if the future brings a change of heart or a dulling of the ache.\\\",\\\"Undoing the vacuum tool (to use Ms. Sokoloff\\u2019s words for the engineering feat that harnesses what is known as distributed computing to untag hundreds or even thousands of images that no longer spark joy) is more laborious.\\\",\\\"It\\u2019s not news that the social network, whose roiling environs hold over 1.5 billion people, is a complex and sometimes confounding space. Navigating its evolving rules and byways requires the nuance and skill of a Jane Austen heroine, as well as the thick skin of a politician.\\\",\\\"(As an aside, you can only pity any would-be Austens who try to chronicle this behavior poetically. Despite social media\\u2019s demonstrable complexity, there\\u2019s a narrative poverty to phrases like \\u201cAnd then I unfollowed my lover on all platforms.\\u201d)\\\",\\\"The Compassion Team is devoted to making Facebook\\u2019s interactions more human, and more humane.\\\",\\\"Ms. Winters and her colleagues have developed tools to help with social resolution, bullying, online aggression (or perceived aggression), eating disorders and issues particular to high school students, working with the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley, the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and other academic partners.\\\",\\\"New projects will assist in identifying suicide ideation in a friend\\u2019s posts, and offer help connecting to resources for suicide prevention. There is a team working on how Facebook profiles can be managed after someone dies; another group has created safety checks, so friends and family can communicate quickly in a disaster.\\\",\\\"One bright, hot Tuesday in February, the sun glinted off the baby-blue cruising bikes that Facebookers ride from one side of their extensive Menlo Park, Calif., campus to the other, looking like healthy undergraduates captured in a college brochure.\\\",\\\"Over 6,000 employees work there, shuttling between the New Urbanism \\u201cvillage\\u201d that once served as Sun Microsystems\\u2019 headquarters (Facebook took it over in 2011) and the 433,000-square-foot open-plan mother ship designed by Frank Gehry on the other side of the Bayfront Expressway.\\\",\\\"Inside the Gehry space, plump Mylar balloons shaped like numbers floated gently above the desks, marking each staff member\\u2019s \\u201cFaceversary,\\u201d as one\\u2019s anniversary of hiring is called. Vending machines offered keyboards and chargers, not Snickers bars. Pink letterpress posters proclaimed \\u201cBe the Nerd,\\u201d among other inspirational slogans.\\\",\\\"Ms. Winters; Gregory Wells, a clinical psychologist; Dan Muriello, an engineer; and Emily Albert, a product designer, were gathered in a conference room named \\u201cOutlook Not Syncing\\u201d to explain how the breakup flow came to be.\\\",\\\"Conference rooms are titled thematically and idiosyncratically. While one series of rooms was inspired by the \\u201cStar Wars\\u201d franchise \\u2014 \\u201cLuke I Am Your Cousin,\\u201d read one sign \\u2014 others, like \\u201cOlympic Fish,\\u201d were more puzzling. This reporter was excited to crack the code of a series of rooms that flummoxed her guide. \\u201cAscending and Descending,\\u201d \\u201cDrawing Hands\\u201d and \\u201cCube with Magic Ribbons,\\u201d to name a few, would appear to pay homage to the work of M. C. Escher.\\\",\\\"Ms. Albert, an ebullient 25-year-old who had been a classically trained ballet dancer before she attended the Rhode Island School of Design, described struggling with the digital legacy of a former boyfriend from college.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI was seeing one post after another,\\u201d she said, \\u201cexperiencing this thing that a lot of my friends have, where it\\u2019s almost impossible to separate when you\\u2019re constantly tied digitally. In one cathartic move toward empowerment, I thought, what if Facebook tried to tackle this?\\u201d\\\",\\\"On the company shuttle home to San Francisco one evening, she floated an idea she had been working on to minimize that entanglement. How to digitally unmesh without choosing \\u201cthe nuclear option\\u201d of unfriending or blocking someone? There was resounding encouragement, she said. \\u201cHeartbreak is a very common ailment here.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Heartache and Facebook do go hand in hand.\\\",\\\"There are studies that have examined the relationship betweenattachment stylesand a tendency toward digital surveillance after a breakup on Facebook. There are studies that show a correlation between thatdigital surveillance\\u2014 so-called Facebook stalking \\u2014 and what\\u2019s known as obsessive relational intrusion, or the pursuit of intimacy with someone who doesn\\u2019t want to be pursued.\\\",\\\"Some studies have found possible links between Facebook use and higher rates ofcheatingin a relationship, which leads to more studies showing that Facebook may be apredictor of divorce.\\\",\\\"There are studies that prove Facebook makes yousad, and studies that show just theopposite. Some researchers aver that Facebook use creates a neuraladdictionby stimulating what is known as a dopamine feedback loop \\u2014 a burst of natural opioids when you receive a status update or peruse a friend\\u2019s page. There are even studies that suggest a relationship between posting one\\u2019srelationship statuson Facebook and the health of that relationship.\\\",\\\"A breakup has stages of aggressiveness, said Morgan Smith, 18, a freshman at Northwestern University.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf you block your ex on every platform, that\\u2019s like 10 on the scale,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf I cut my ex off on Facebook, it\\u2019s also too much negative energy on my part. I want to extend a polite opening for the future. I don\\u2019t want to see what you do every day with your life\\u201d \\u2014 as on Snapchat, for example \\u2014 \\u201cbut if you\\u2019re accepted to the study-abroad program or become class president, I would like to congratulate you. Facebook is more of a long-term document of your life.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Matthew Kopfler, a 37-year-oldchef in New Orleans, was a bit more bedeviled by his Facebook breakup, though he dutifully untagged any photos he and his ex had appeared in, and unfollowed her on all platforms, not just Facebook. But he forgot to \\u201cunlike\\u201d her Facebook business page (his ex has a wine store, so their social media presence was a snarl of work and pleasure).\\\",\\\"This meant, he said: \\u201cthe vague passive-aggressive post would filter through my feed, and inject anxiety in whatever circumstance. Time is the only healer, but Facebook sure does throw it in your face sometimes. On the same note, my dog died two months ago, and Facebook wants me to share his picture once a week.\\u201d\\\",\\\"For Madeline Kaufman, 20, a journalism student at Northwestern, her Facebook breakup was like a game of digital chicken. It took her four months to \\u201cbreak up\\u201d with her long-term boyfriend on Facebook, though they had done so in the real world.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe kept his status \\u2018in a relationship\\u2019 for another two months,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was a weird \\u2018letting go\\u2019 concept I had to get over, and was weirdly hard for me to do. But I guess in that respect I may have \\u2018won\\u2019 because I took mine down first.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Alisha Ardiana, 42, a dog trainer \\u201cin training,\\u201d as she put it, in San Francisco, is still wincing from her first foray into Facebook back in 2008, when she connected with her birth mother, along with her entire birth family, and joined the social network as a way of communicating with her new clan.\\\",\\\"The breakup that ensued was traumatizing, she said. When she had a falling out with her mother, the rest of the family unfriended her, too, which meant, Ms. Ardiana said, that she logged on one day and \\u201cI had no friends at all. We had been in this virtual room together, and they all left.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Years later, having overseen her birth father\\u2019s illness and death on the social network, she said, \\u201cI feel strongly that Facebook is an amazing tool, but it holds such a concentrated amount of emotions and not always on our terms.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Michael Rich, director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Boston Children\\u2019s Hospital and an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, has been studying the effects of social media on young adults since the birth of the technologies that have enabled the networks.\\\",\\\"Last week on Ask the Mediatrician, the online forum he runs, Dr. Rich received atypical queryfrom a young woman who was unable to stop cyberstalking her ex on Facebook, though she had unsubscribed from his news feed, a behavior compounded by that of her girlfriends, who she said were all doing the same thing.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe see someone who would never think of stalking their ex-partner in real life doing it quite easily online,\\u201d Dr. Rich said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re seeing a lot of behaviors that have existed since the dawn of time\\u201d \\u2014 jealousy, in other words \\u2014 \\u201cplaying out very differently on social media.\\u201d Some behaviors are being amplified, but others may be muted.\\\",\\\"A few years ago, Dr. Rich\\u2019s group, along with Boston\\u2019s Public Health Commission, organized a seminar for teenagers that spurred the slogan \\u201cFace it, Don\\u2019t Facebook It.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Dr. Rich said: \\u201cIt was about honoring the quality of the relationship when it was good by facing your partner and saying, \\u2018It\\u2019s not working.\\u2019 \\u2018Face it, Don\\u2019t Facebook It\\u2019 was about having some emotional skin in the game instead of just changing your status online. I\\u2019m concerned that all these tools with the best of intentions will create a socially more-acceptable way of not facing things. These tools are morphing and evolving so rapidly that we have to keep re-educating ourselves as the tools change.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In a Facebook tradition for birthing new products, Ms. Albert refined her breakup idea at a 24-hour hackathon \\u2014 like a sleepover for geeks, as she put it \\u2014 then road-tested it among many survey respondents, had it massaged and amplified by more engineers and researchers, and finally presented it to Mark Zuckerberg in April 2015, in a two-minute pitch in his glass-walled conference room. (A guide pointed out the room and gestured vaguely to a clutch of identical workstations nearby. Which one was Mr. Zuckerberg\\u2019s? \\u201cI can\\u2019t tell you that,\\u201d the guide said.)\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019ve had my fair share of trials to overcome,\\u201d Ms. Albert said later. \\u201cI was diagnosed with anorexia as a teenager. Working on the eating disorders project, I was able to act as half designer and half advocate. It\\u2019s incredibly healing to bring goodness out of things that have caused you pain.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Finding the right tone was a big part of the design process, Ms. Albert said, language being crucial in creating a tool kit that would be flexible enough to address a 14-year-old breaking up with her boyfriend of four weeks as well as longtime married couples with children.\\\",\\\"It also had to be neutral, not familiar, and not in any way hortatory. \\u201cIf designers are in charge of surprise and delight,\\u201d she said, \\u201cwhat does it mean to design for aspects of life that are painful?\\u201d\\\",\\\"Facebook language isn\\u2019t lyric poetry, by any means, but it does the trick. If you\\u2019re able to stumble onto the breakup flow (not an easy task, at this point; it\\u2019s only available on mobile and only in the United States), you should discover, as Ms. Winters described, a bento box of options.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTake a Break. Here are some changes that might be helpful. We won\\u2019t notify Taylor of any changes you make. See less of Taylor. See Taylor on Facebook only if you visit his profile.\\u201d And so on. Mostly the language is like that of an instruction manual \\u2014 \\u201cTurn on tag approvals for posts and photos you\\u2019re tagged in\\u201d \\u2014 though at the end, it veers into self-care: \\u201cReach out to people you trust for support. Stay Active. \\u2026\\u201d\\\",\\\"There were some ideas that were, as Ms. Albert said, \\u201cout of scope to build, the idea of locking yourself out, temporarily, from one person\\u2019s account, trying to prevent that stalking behavior.\\u201d Technologically, she said, it was a bridge too far, and it led to a bigger conversation about what role Facebook wants to play in people\\u2019s lives. \\u201cIt would be like Starbucks not accepting your credit card,\\u201d she said.\\\",\\\"And just maybe such stalking is productive for some, a step toward resilience that would never accrue from watching baby sloth videos or mash-ups of Donald Trump tweets.\\\",\\\"Ms. Sokoloff, the brand strategist who yearned for a digital vacuum cleaner, wondered if there wasn\\u2019t some emotional cost in making all traces of a relationship disappear. \\u201cIs there something important in the healing process that would be lost if we can essentially have the Facebook equivalent of the dream removers from \\u2018Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\u2019?\\u201d\\\",\\\"In her latest book, \\u201cReclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age,\\u201d Sherry Turkle explores, as she puts it, \\u201chow technology makes us forget what we know about life.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Dr. Turkle, director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, and a longtime observer of how people interact with their machines, recalled a presentation in the \\u201cearly days of the Internet of Things,\\u201d she said, \\u201cfor how we might use this new way of animating our worlds.\\u201d\\\",\\\"It was a phone app that would present you with a path to, say, Starbucks, that was designed to bypass former lovers who may be in the way, or indeed anyone you had tagged as someone to avoid. In this way, Dr. Turkle said, you could enjoy a friction-free walk to pick up your mocha frappuccino.\\\",\\\"The notion of \\u201cfriction-free\\u201d still disturbs her. \\u201cMaybe you\\u2019re not supposed to move on for a year,\\u201d she said, while noting the boons of Facebook\\u2019s breakup tools. \\u201cI was thinking about people compulsively reading old love letters and diaries, poring over old wedding albums and photos, and then writing poetry, short stories, novels.\\u201d Making art, in other words, after marinating in the stew of the past.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not to say that Facebook shouldn\\u2019t make it easy to click that button to avoid certain painful memories,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut the reason we\\u2019re looking through those old love letters is we\\u2019re trying to work through our past. I think we just have to acknowledge the humanness of that process and be compassionate with ourselves. Life is supposed to be complicated.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A few weeks ago, Ms. Albert was on vacation in Barcelona with her boyfriend. In the last days of the trip, he surprised her with a private tour of the Gothic Quarter.
