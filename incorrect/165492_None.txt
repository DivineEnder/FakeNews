"{\"title\": \"Germany's AfD Announces Minaret, Call To Prayer, Halal Slaughter Ban Ahead Of Sunday's Crucial Elections\", \"content\": \"The new proposed federal AfD manifesto will be put to a vote on April 30th with\\u00a0a number of potentially controversial policies, reports Bild. The party is looking\\u00a0to enforce the concept of the separation of faith and state with a number of initiatives\\u00a0directed at religious customs.The party announced that it will seek a ban on minarets and the Islamic call to prayer which is traditionally sung and often played through loudspeakers throughout the day. Party strategists justify this saying that the minaret is a \\u201csymbol of Islamic rule,\\u201d and that current policies \\u201ccontradict a tolerant coexistence of religions,\\u201d which they claim only Christian churches embrace\\u00a0in the modern age.They also took aim at halal slaughter saying that they believe the special religious rules are contrary to the German Animal Protection Act. AfD would rather see animals slaughtered in the most humane way possible as halal slaughter would be regarded as cruel if it were not given a religious pass. Male circumcision was another related policy point that the party supports banning, stating that circumcision is contrary to human dignity and it disregards the fundamental rights to physical integrity and self-determination of affected children.According to Die Welt, the AfD is getting broad support from Russian-Germans who have until recently been thought to be mostly apolitical. Russian-Germans are the descendants of ethnic Germans who escaped the Stalinist Soviet Union or who were forcibly relocated after the war. The migrant crisis and the story of the rape of a 13-year-old in Berlin are thought to have\\u00a0galvanized\\u00a0that community.Many Germans still consider Russo-Germans as outsiders, and Russo-Germans themselves say that they are not always accepted by their fellow countrymen. \\u201cIf you say you come from Haidach, it is the same, you are Russian,\\u201d said Nicole Herber, a university student. Andreas Fabricius who is an ethnic German from Kazakhstan said Germans often refer to him as \\u201cagent Putin\\u201d but he said, \\u201cnever as a German citizen,\\u201d though he has been in Germany since 2002.Some 50 migrants currently live in the district of Haidach and many have reported becoming\\u00a0worried for their own safety while walking the streets at night. Approximately 20 anti-migrant demonstrations have occurred in the area since January, attracting up to 800 people on the streets. The speakers at the events said women and children were particularly vulnerable to possible attacks from migrants.According to the\\u00a0pundits, the German regional elections this Sunday may see large gains for the AfD who won between 10-20 per cent of the votes in last weeks Hessen elections. The strongest AfD support is in Saxony which will be voting this weekend along with several other regions.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 165492}"
