"{\"content\": \"On Friday\\u2019s broadcast of PBS\\u2019 \\u201cWashington Week,\\u201d\\u00a0Washington Post\\u00a0Political Correspondent\\u00a0Anne Gearan stated that when she took questions about her emails earlier in the day, Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \\u201clooked about as close to being in a hostage video as I\\u2019ve seen her\\u201d and \\u201ccame very close to pointing fingers at Comey in a partisan way.\\u201dGearan said, \\u201cWell, the campaign is doing a sort of a slow-motion version of what they have done in response to this email issue from \\u2014 for a year-and-a-half now, which is, hunker down, investigate internally, think it through, issue an anodyne statement \\u2013 in this case from John Podesta \\u2013 and then work up to having Hillary Clinton say something herself. She looked about as close to being in a hostage video as I\\u2019ve seen her at that podium tonight. She took three-and-a-half minutes of questions. It wasn\\u2019t an extensive iteration of this. And she came very close to pointing fingers at Comey in a partisan way. She walked right up to the line of saying this is \\u2014 this, in her view, is an inappropriate thing for him to be doing. She walked right up to that.\\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 207178, \"title\": \"Anne Gearan: Clinton Looked 'Close To Being in a Hostage Video' Answer Email Questions\"}"
