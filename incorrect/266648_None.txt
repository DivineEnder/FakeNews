"{\"title\": \"The Terrorist Campaign to Recruit Juveniles and Attack Children\", \"content\": \"On March 11, a suspected terrorist broke into the home of an Israeli family and committed an unspeakable act, butchering five members of the family, including an infant, while they slept.Fox News Channel had the gruesome details:\\n\\nOne paramedic on the scene noted, \\u201cThe murder scene was shocking. Kids\\u2019 toys right next to pools of blood.\\u201dAn official for Hamas, the Islamic terrorist group linked to the brutal attack, initially claimed that murdering Jewish settlers was permitted by international law before backtracking a day later, making the claim that \\u201charming children is not part of Hamas\\u2019s policy.\\u201dBut according to documents we recently uncovered from the Defense Intelligence Agency, brutality against children is all part of a plan by Islamic terrorist groups to strike fear into their opponents. And not only are they targeting children with violence, but they\\u2019re also brainwashing other children to do their dirty work. (Overall, the records consist of two Joint Task Force Intelligence Information Reports from debriefs of detainees at the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.)Through use of the Freedom of Information Act, Judicial Watch made the remarkable discovery, and then instantly made headlines on Fox News Channel. (You can watch reporter Catherine Herridge\\u2019s special report here, highlighting our work.) You can also read the documents for yourself. But here are a few of the highlights:\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nThe records note that \\u201capproximately 40% of Al Qaida members in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq are composed of juveniles under the age of 18.\\u201d Terrorists recruit juveniles at Koran study groups, soccer games, summer camps, trips to other cities and swimming pools. Some extremists with connections to law enforcement purposely target and coerce potential juvenile recruits while the youths are under arrest and detained in jail.(In November 2001, Suleiman Abu Ghaith, Senior Advisor to bin Laden and al-Qaida spokesman, said, \\u201cWe have not reached parity with [America]. We have the right to kill four million Americans, two million of them children and to exile twice as many and wound and cripple hundreds of thousands.\\u201d [Emphasis added])These documents describe al-Qaida\\u2019s evil strategy: Target and recruit impressionable juveniles to carry out terrorist acts while purposely inflicting violence on children to strike fear in those who oppose them. We should be concerned that radical Islamists are using their religion to brainwash young people to commit terrorist acts and to justify the murder of innocent children.And it should not have taken more than five years and two presidential administrations to force the release these documents. It is essential to tell the American people the truth about the strategies and tactics of Islamic extremists.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 266648}"
