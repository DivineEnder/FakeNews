"{\"article_id\": 253260, \"content\": \"This morning\\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\\nChristians forced out of the town of Mosul by ISIS take shelter in a church. (Aleteia)There\\u2019s a frequently heard complaint that while the mainstream media frequently report on jihadist attacks, they seem to ignore the attacks on Christians. This criticism was directed at me after this article:  \\u201c26-Dec-14 World View \\u2014 \\u2018Barbaric\\u2019 ethnic massacre in Assam province shocks Indians\\u201d. One person wrote (paraphrasing): \\u201cJohn, my point is that you left Christians off your list entirely, while at the same time they are being brutally massacred all around the world. You didn\\u2019t get it then, perhaps due to your biases. You\\u2019re not getting it now.\\u201d Another person wrote, \\u201cAdmit it. You don\\u2019t like Christians and you downplay violence against them.\\u201dLet me assure you, Dear Reader, that I wouldn\\u2019t hesitate for a nanosecond to report on a massacre of Christians by jihadists or anyone else. So if that\\u2019s true, you may ask, then why don\\u2019t I write about massacres of Christians more often?Let\\u2019s look at some numbers. How many Christians have actually been massacred by jihadists? I went to the anti-Muslim \\u201cReligion of Peace\\u201d web site where they have tables of jihadist attacks, including a table of Christians killed by jihadists. Here are the numbers:A new report sponsored by the BBC finds that more than 5,000 people worldwide died in November alone \\u2014 just one month \\u2014 as a result of jihadist violence. This would indicate that about 60,000 people have died from jihadist attacks per year.If you put all these figures together, you can see that the number of Christians killed by jihadists is minuscule \\u2014 less than 2% \\u2014 compared to the total number of people killed by jihadists. Quite honestly, I would guess that in any given country in recent years, more Christians have been killed by traffic accidents than by terrorists. Overwhelmingly, the people being killed by jihadists are other Muslims.So that explains the lack of media coverage of Christians killed by jihadists. If less than 2% of the victims are Christian, then you would expect Christians to get not much more than 2% of the coverage.Once again, Dear Reader, when there is a massacre of Christians (let\\u2019s hope that it won\\u2019t happen), then I would not hesitate to report it. But what\\u2019s really going on is that jihadists are overwhelmingly attacking other Muslims. There\\u2019s a war going on, and it\\u2019s not between Christians and Muslims. It\\u2019s between Muslims and Muslims, and it\\u2019s going to have a huge effect on all our futures. The Religion Of Peace and BBCAccording to figures published by the Syrian Observatory For Human Rights, there have been at least 1,878 documented executions by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (IS or ISIS or ISIL) since it became a self-declared \\u201cCaliphate\\u201d on June 28, 2014.That figure includes 120 of its own ISIS members, who were executed for trying to return back home.The dead included 930 members of the Shaitat tribe, an important Sunni Muslim tribe that\\u2019s been opposing ISIS. This is an example of Sunni Muslims massacring Sunni Muslims.Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in Syria since 2011, when Syria\\u2019s genocidal monster Bashar al-Assad began launching heavy weapons and chemical-laden barrel bombs on innocent women and children. Now they\\u2019ve been joined by ISIS in massacring thousands more Sunni civilians.And by the way, I should also mention Pakistan. Last week\\u2019s  horrific Taliban attack on a Peshawar army school, killing over 130 schoolchildren, shows that Pakistan is at war with itself, with Sunni Muslim terrorists killing Sunni and Shia Muslim civilians almost every day.Once again, Dear Reader, we are not seeing a war of Muslims against Christians, although some Christians are targeted. What we\\u2019re seeing is something of historic proportions: A massive and growing war of Muslims against Muslims \\u2014 Sunni Muslims against Sunni Muslims, Sunni Muslims against Shia Muslims, and Shia Muslims against Sunni Muslims. The intensity of this war has been growing for several years, and at some point will engulf at least the Mideast and South Asia.
