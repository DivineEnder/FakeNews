"{\"content\": \"The Washington Post reports that journalists are complaining of the White House\\u2019s heavy-handed rudeness towards them when they do anything but fawn over the administration, branding the correspondence \\u201cnastygrams.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen a reporter gets something wrong or is perceived as being too aggressive, the response is often swift and sometimes at top volume, reporters say \\u2026\\u2026  In one of the e-mails that reporters have dubbed \\u201cnastygrams,\\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney branded one of Mason\\u2019s stories \\u201cpartisan, inflammatory and tendentious.\\u201d National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor, reacting to comments Mason made in a TV discussion, sent her an e-mail that included an animated picture of a crying mime \\u2014 a visual suggestion that she was whining.WaPo tries to offset this by reminding readers of how past press secretaries went to bat with media bosses over the heads of beat reporters, but this pales in comparison to what we\\u2019ve seen from the \\u201cmost transparent\\u201d administration ever.\\n\\nYou think? And it\\u2019s not just Jay Carney \\u2014 it\\u2019s the entire administration:\\n\\n\\n[youtube fxxotkX9ZOo nolink]Joe Biden has traveled across the country, threatening Americans with \\u201crapes and murders\\u201d if congress didn\\u2019t pass Obama\\u2019s jobs bill, the same jobs bill that Democrats killed in the Senate (so are on the hook for said \\u201crapes and murders?\\u201d). He didn\\u2019t like  the questioning he received from Human Events\\u2019s Jason Mattera on the subject, so now the  White House is taking aim at Mattera with an  investigation.Joe Biden\\u2019s office has complained to the Senate press gallery about a confrontation the vice president had with a conservative journalist last week on Capitol Hill.Biden aides asked whether Senate rules were broken in the wake of the contentious exchange between the vice president and the reporter.\\n\\nFed up with the media attention, Eric Holder today lashed out at the Daily Caller for daring to ask him about the scandal, replete with finger-pointing.Embattled Attorney General Eric Holder today demanded The Daily Caller stop publishing articles about the growing calls in Congress for his resignation because of the failed Operation Fast and Furious gun-walking program.As Holder\\u2019s aide was escorting the attorney general offstage following his remarks Tuesday afternoon at the White House, a Daily Caller reporter introduced himself and shook Holder\\u2019s hand. The reporter asked him for a response to the growing chorus of federal legislators demanding his resignation.Holder stepped towards the exit, then turned around, stepped back toward the reporter, and sternly said, \\u201cYou guys need to \\u2014 you need to stop this. It\\u2019s not an organic thing that\\u2019s just happening. You guys are behind it.\\u201dAudio and full story  here.The press is behind it? The Daily Caller reporter? Holder behaves as if this reporter walked guns across the border himself, only to return to the office and pen salacious stories about Holder\\u2019s knowledge and sanction of it.The WaPo piece also mentions Sharyl Attkisson\\u2019s dressing down by a DOJ rep:\\n\\nHonestly, media shouldn\\u2019t be surprised.\\n\\nThe same administration who likened half of the country to \\u201cNazis\\u201d due to their desire to pay their own medical bills, the same administration who placed well-meaning conservatives and returning troops from the Middle East ont he DHS list for suspicion over \\u201cdomestic terrorism\\u201d and freak outs, respectively will surely turn on the press\\u2013especially the lower the President falls in the polls.And that\\u2019s just it: the more the President struggles, the more  combative his administration becomes with the media. They are invested in his success, having carried so much water for him during 2008; if he fails, their failure is more pronounced.The article notes that Carney hasn\\u2019t limited access, but I disagree. A contentious attitude and using a position as a bully pulpit to browbeat reporters into submission is a form of denial if I ever heard one. Even now, the media still feels the need to make excuses for the administration while they reluctantly report (kudos) on it.\", \"title\": \"White House's Relations With Media Turn Nasty\"}"
