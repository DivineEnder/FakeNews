"{\"article_id\": 173027, \"content\": \"The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Judiciary demanded on Tuesday\\u00a0to know why a \\u201ctotal breakdown in cooperation between local and federal law enforcement\\u201d occurred, and authorities let violent illegal alien Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez roam the streets of a sanctuary city instead of deporting him.Ramirez, along with accomplice Jose Fernando Villagomez, allegedly\\u00a0broke into Marilyn Pharis\\u2019s home on July 24 while she slept, beat her with a hammer\\u00a0until both her eye sockets were shattered and her neck broken, while strangling and raping her with a foreign object. Despite her horrifying injuries, she managed to call police \\u2014 as Ramirez\\u00a0broke into another home. She died eight days later of her injuries.Ramirez\\u00a0faces special allegations that could make him eligible for the death penalty, such as \\u201cfelony murder with rape by instrument and murder with torture,\\u201d according to the Santa Maria Times. He also pled not guilty to charges of \\u201cattempted murder, first-degree burglary with person present, assault with intent to commit rape, sexual penetration by foreign object and resisting a peace officer\\u201d last week.Grassley wrote in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson:It appears that Martinez [Ramirez] has been arrested several times since 2009, but through a combination of sanctuary city policies that the Santa Maria Police Department was required to follow and official disinterest in the cases on the part of ICE, Martinez was eventually released to allegedly murder Ms. Pharis. In 2009, Martinez was arrested for driving without a license, but ICE elected not to file a detainer on him. In May 2014, Martinez was arrested on felony drug and sexual assault (later modified to misdemeanor battery) charges. That time, ICE did file a detainer on Martinez, but the Santa Maria sheriff\\u2019s office declined to honor it.Santa Maria officials\\u00a0never explained why Ramirez\\u2019s felony sexual assault charges were dropped, nor did they notify ICE when they released him on probation. Grassley added in the letter:Clearly, there has been a total breakdown in cooperation between local and federal law enforcement that allowed this alleged killer to be released and, despite his lengthy and violent criminal record, never deported. Police Chief Martin said, \\u2018I\\u00a0am not remiss to say that from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento, there\\u2019s a blood trail into the bedroom of Marilyn Pharis.\\u2019\\u00a0Clearly, sanctuary city policies are wreaking havoc on citizens, and especially on women.Police\\u00a0previously said\\u00a0they \\u201cdon\\u2019t care\\u201d that Ramirez is an illegal alien after they arrested him.\\u201cWe have a citizen that lost her life, it\\u2019s serious, when you look at it, we don\\u2019t care what the circumstances were, we\\u2019re going to do what we need to do to get our facts and bring this individual to justice,\\u201d\\u00a0Santa Maria Police Department Commander Kendall Greene said.But Santa Maria Police Chief Ralph Martin blamed both California Gov. Jerry Brown\\u2019s and President Barack Obama\\u2019s immigration policies that prevented local and federal law enforcement from cooperating.\\u201cI am not remiss to say that, from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento, there is a blood trail into the bedroom of Marilyn Pharis,\\u201d he\\u00a0said.\\u00a0\\u201cWe can all point fingers locally at each other.\\u00a0ICE can point the finger at the sheriff, they can point it everywhere else, but the reality is it starts at the very top, and it\\u2019s not going to get fixed until it gets started at the very top and reached the lower levels.\\u201dDespite Pharis\\u2019s alleged rape and torture-murder becoming national news as public rage builds against \\u201csanctuary city\\u201d policies, Martin said he heard nothing but \\u201ccrickets\\u201d from state and federal officials.Grassley is also demanding to know if Ramirez had applied for amnesty during the time in\\u00a0which he was\\u00a0committing crime sprees in California.Email Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.
