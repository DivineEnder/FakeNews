Indeed, the rifts among congressional Republicans exposed by the health care battle might just get deeper.Ever since President \\n      Donald Trump\\n       was elected, investors have used a tax-reform plan House Republicans drew up last year as their lodestar. The plan, championed by Speaker \\n      Paul Ryan, \\n       calls for a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. To help pay for that plan, it includes a border adjustment tax that would levy goods imported into the U.S.The corporate tax cut, which would boost earnings, is a big part of why the market had been enjoying a post-election rally until recently. The fight will be over how to pay for it.The failed health bill would have made tax reform easier because it created budgetary offsets that made it easier to cut corporate taxes without adding to the deficit. The border tax Republicans have proposed to help pay for tax cuts might also fall by the wayside.The idea behind the border tax is that the U.S. would tax imports and exempt exports. Proponents say this won\\u2019t actually hurt importers because the dollar will adjust higher, leaving import costs unchanged. Retailers and other importers are skeptical of the dollar theory, and vocally so. This all has political ramifications.Michigan is a prototypical manufacturing state where voters who have seen jobs move overseas might be expected to show strong support for the import tax since it favors exporters and encourages domestic production. But shoe company \\n        Wolverine Worldwide\\n        \\n       and retail chain Meijer are among the Michigan companies that have come out against the tax. Both are headquartered in congressional districts held by Republicans.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\\u2019s Heard on the Street team.

And when it comes to the number of businesses in each industry, the gap is even wider: The Census counts about 910,000 retailing firms in the U.S. versus 227,000 manufacturing firms.If taxing imports is a no go then paying for the corporate tax cut gets harder. And, while optimists sometimes argue otherwise, cutting taxes without paying for them would be difficult. Fiscally conservative Republicans may balk at voting for a higher budget deficit and demand entitlement cuts instead. Those cuts, in turn, could be a hard sell with swing-district moderates.If the Republicans can\\u2019t agree on what to tax to pay for the cuts then the lower corporate taxes that investors have been betting on may be more modest than expected. To get the win they desperately need, Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan may decide to set their sights a lot lower. Investors should follow suit.Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.comAppeared in the Mar. 28, 2017, print edition as 'Time to Redo Tax-Reform Math.'\", \"source_id\": 22245}"
