They\\u2019ll climb it or they\\u2019ll go under it,\\u201d Ms. Kimbro said while taking a break from hunting Javelina,\\u00a0an animal that resembles a wild boar.\\u00a0\\u201cNo matter what they build on the border, it isn\\u2019t going to stop all traffic.\\u201dRanchers across Arizona\\u2019s 375-mile southern border have long called for more security to thwart the stream of drugs and people crossing their land.\\u00a0In President \\n      Donald Trump, \\n       many feel like they finally have a champion. But\\u00a0when it comes to the question\\u00a0of Mr. Trump\\u2019s promise to build\\u00a0a wall\\u00a0along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico,\\u00a0Arizona ranchers have a somewhat unexpected answer: It\\u2019s complicated.They\\u00a0favor an approach that takes into account the varied terrain and location\\u00a0of their land.Ms. Kimbro says she wants more\\u00a0U.S. Border Patrol agents who periodically maneuver their SUV\\u2019s along the dirt road that skirts her four-mile property line with Mexico.Some 50 miles west,\\u00a0fellow rancher John Ladd prefers the 18-foot tall, steel fencing that currently shields a small segment of his ranch near Naco, which he says is a favorite corridor for drug couriers who navigate through plumes of high desert grass and mesquite shrubs.Dan Bell, who grazes his cattle\\u00a0around the rugged hills above Nogales, envisions a combination of more technology\\u2014like sensors\\u2014manpower and fencing on the U.S. Forest Service land he leases.\\u201cAccess is the most important issue that we face\\u2014so we can get to the border and patrol the border,\\u201d said Mr. Bell, pointing to a hillside where a Border Patrol fence abruptly ends as the terrain steepens.\\u201cThen, we can look at what works best,\\u201d he added,\\u00a0whether that is \\u201ctechnology in a certain area, or an actual physical barrier.\\u201dAll three ranchers supported Mr. Trump and said they hope he ultimately embraces a multifaceted approach to border security.Most of Arizona\\u2019s border with Mexico already has some type of barrier. In some locations that might only be barbed wire, or the short, post-and-rail fence that snakes across some of Ms. Kimbro\\u2019s land.Patrick Bray, executive vice president of the Arizona Cattle Growers Association, which represents 1,000 ranchers, praised the new administration for \\u201ctaking border security seriously.\\u201dHe said in practical terms, however, ranchers\\u00a0foresee\\u00a0a mix of physical structures, additional Border Patrol officers and more technology like drones or helicopters.\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we expect a wall to happen,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe wall in our mind will look different than what people assume.\\u201dArizona\\u2019s Republican Governor, \\n      Doug Ducey, \\n       toured the border here last month with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.Mr. Ducey supports \\u201csome structural barriers\\u201d on the border, but also wants more resources and manpower, spokesman Daniel Scarpinato said. Following their trip, the Governor was left with the impression that the Department of Homeland Security is open to using a variety of methods, Mr. Scarpinato said.\\u201cThere does seem to be a recognition that there would probably be different solutions in different states and different communities,\\u201d said Mr. Scarpinato.A spokeswoman for the DHS didn\\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Some who live along the border say boosting security alone isn\\u2019t the answer. Business owners say a wall could damage commercial relationships with Mexico, while others worry about the humanitarian impact.\\u201cI think the desire to build the wall is misguided. It doesn\\u2019t really address the fundamental reasons why people migrate,\\u201d said Rev. Sean Carroll, executive director of the Kino Border Initiative, a group that advocates for deportees and is based both in Nogales, Ariz. and Nogales, Mexico. \\u201cThose issues are economic need, family and separation and violence in the areas where they are living.\\u201dRev. Carroll said that while he understands the concerns of Arizona ranchers over safety, it would be a better use of resources to address the \\u201croot cause\\u201d of such issues rather than add agents and equipment to a border that is already heavily militarized.Some Arizona ranchers acknowledge the situation has improved. They say they no longer see large groups of migrants crossing their land each day, but instead are on the lookout for small crews of drug smugglers. They attribute the change to beefed-up Border Patrol manpower, better surveillance technology, and the influence of Mexican cartels who experts say charge exorbitant fees for anyone wanting to cross the border.A spokeswoman for the Border Patrol\\u2019s Tucson sector said newer Bollard-style fencing,\\u00a0which is fashioned with steel columns and was installed\\u00a0over the past six years, along with fixed towers that use cameras, have helped in the Nogales and Douglas areas.Mr. Ladd said such improvements are welcome, but more is needed to protect his 16,000-acre ranch.Different types of fencing already run the length of the 10-mile border he shares with Mexico, most of it 10- to 13-feet high and made of mesh.\\u00a0Mr. Ladd said he supported the idea of a\\u00a0wall, at least in some places.The fourth-generation rancher says the\\u00a0barriers on his land haven\\u2019t stopped drug smugglers from carving out sections with power tools or driving straight through, though that has happened less frequently in recent years.Recently, the Border Patrol began replacing a 2\\u00bd mile stretch of fencing on his land with an 18-foot-high Bollard fence, part of a larger Border Patrol project to replace some seven-and-a-half miles of older barriers in the area.As construction crews rumbled down a dusty road on the edge of the ranch, the mountains of Sonora, Mexico seemingly just feet away, a Border Patrol agent scoured for footprints.Mr. Ladd eyed the new fencing, noting that more agents were still needed on the actual border to man it. Taller barriers would help, he said, especially if they ran the entire length of his property, something he hopes final plans for a wall include.\\u201cI would damn sure take it,\\u201d he said.Write to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.comAppeared in the Mar. 16, 2017, print edition as 'Ranchers Have Their Own Ideas on Border.'\"}"
