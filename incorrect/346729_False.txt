"{\"title\": \"At Vigil for Orlando Victims, Utah Republican Apologizes to L.G.B.T. Community\", \"content\": \"{\\\"As a conservative Republican leader in Utah, Spencer Cox may be an unlikely luminary for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\\\",\\\"But the lieutenant governor\\u2019sspeech at acandlelight vigilin Salt Lake City for the Orlando shooting victims has been widely shared on social media, and he said in an interview Thursday that the response has been uniformly positive \\u2014 including from fellow conservative Republicans.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m hopeful, if nothing else, I can give some cover for other politicians who feel things but don\\u2019t say them for whatever reason,\\u201d Mr. Cox, 40, said.\\\",\\\"In the speech Monday, he acknowledged that as a \\u201cbalding, youngish, middle-aged, straight, white, male, Republican politician,\\u201d he was an unexpected speaker at the event. But he was praised for confronting his past attitudes toward gay people, and apologized for his past treatment of gay students at his small, rural high school.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere were some kids in my class that were different,\\u201d Mr. Cox said at the vigil, which was attended by about 1,000 people. \\u201cSometimes I wasn\\u2019t kind to them. I didn\\u2019t know it at the time, but I know now that they were gay. I will forever regret not treating them with the kindness, dignity and respect \\u2014 the love \\u2014 that they deserved. For that, I sincerely and humbly apologize.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Cox said the fact that many among the 49 victims in Orlando were gay shouldn\\u2019t matter, \\u201cbut I\\u2019m here because it does.\\u201d He said that change would happen through personal change, not through politicians, and praised the L.G.B.T. community for welcoming him at the vigil, despite their political differences.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou have treated me with the kindness, dignity, and respect \\u2014 the love \\u2014 that I very often did not deserve,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd it has made me love you.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The decision to invite Mr. Cox to speak at the vigil was not without controversy, said Troy Williams, the executive director of Equality Utah, which organized the gathering. The L.G.B.T. community in Utah has had a largely adversarial relationship with the current administration, which hasjoined a lawsuitagainst the Obama administration over the use of bathrooms by transgender people andopposes same-sex marriage.\\\",\\\"Mr. Williams said he did not know what Mr. Cox would say when the politician was invited to speak, but said the lieutenant governor had long been open to discussion. He called the result \\u201ca beautiful speech.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe hope that this will set a new standard of discourse with Republican leadership,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Mr. Cox said he had mended his relationship with those students he teased in high school. One of them reached out to him after the speech and thanked him, he said.\\\",\\\"He said his attitudes changed as he got to know people in the gay community, whom he praised for their patience with him. He said he would sometimes say the wrong things \\u201cbecause I\\u2019m not sure how to say the right things, but they laugh and kind of help me through it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhen you actually sit around and really get to know someone, it makes it much harder to demonize or discredit people,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe can have disagreements over policy and still love each other and still be friends, and that\\u2019s something I think is getting lost more and more in the partisan world we live in.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 346729}"
