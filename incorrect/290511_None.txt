"{\"title\": \"Cracked.com Editor Temporarily Banned from Reddit\", \"content\": \"During an \\u201cask me anything\\u201d (AmA) session on Reddit, Wong wrongly claimed that his critics \\u2013 who accuse him of turning Cracked from an irreverent comedy site into a bastion of dour progressive moralising \\u2013 were invading the discussion thread to upvote negative comments and downvote positive ones.Displaying an uncharacteristic sense of humour, moderators on Reddit took action, but not in the way that Pargin might have hoped. They banned Wong and deleted his AmA, after he called on his own supporters to invade the discussion thread.Wong accused \\u201cGamerGate\\u201d of \\u201corganising a downvote brigade,\\u201d complaining that \\u201csometimes, racist, misogynist teenagers don\\u2019t have anything better to do.\\u201d Wong then asked his Twitter followers to \\u201cplease go downvote their bulls**t.\\u201d\\u00a0It was Wong\\u2019s explicit call for organised voting (a banned practice on Reddit) that led moderators to delete his thread and temporarily ban him.Prior to the deletion of the thread, many of the highest-voted comments directed at Wong were critical in their tone. \\u201cWhy has Cracked become so similar to BuzzFeed and other click-bait sites?\\u201d asked one. \\u201cWhat was the catalyst that began Cracked\\u2019s transformation from a witty satirical site to a second-rate version of Salon?\\u201d asked another.Despite Wong\\u2019s accusations of organised voting campaigns on the part of his opponents, there is nothing to suggest that his apparent unpopularity on Reddit is anything other than the natural result of widespread dissatisfaction with the direction of Cracked. As one GamerGate supporter bluntly remarked: \\u201cit turned out that most Redditors are not fans of his crappy SJW blog.\\u201dIt also appears that Wong is not a fan of Redditors. One intrepid Redditor has uncovered year-old comments from Wong repeatedly accusing the site\\u2019s users of holding being racists and woman-haters. Wong would troll posts that were critical of feminism, accusing thread-starters of creating Reddit\\u2019s \\u201cmisogynist circle-jerk of the day.\\u201dLittle wonder then, that so many Redditors accuse Wong\\u2019s comedy site of becoming little more than a knockoff version of Salon or Gawker.\\u00a0Once upon a time, the site knew few comedic boundaries. For example, this \\u201cStar Wars\\u201d parody, created by\\u00a0former contributor John Cheese contains racial stereotypes, rape jokes, and intensely vulgar language. It specifically advises the easily offended to stay away.Today, things are different. In his AmA, Wong proudly proclaimed that his writers \\u201ctry really hard to walk through the reasoning behind our criticism\\u201d and explain \\u201cwhy seemingly innocuous things can be toxic.\\u201d Readers waiting for a punchline were disappointed: Wong was being serious.In one viral image, the website\\u2019s former content is compared to its current fare. On one side of the image is the site\\u2019s front page as it appeared in 2010, featuring articles about superhero identities, historical identities, and writing tips. On the other is the site as it appears today \\u2013 plastered with headlines like \\u201c5 ways men are trained to hate women,\\u201d \\u201cThe 5 weirdest things that can cause you to be racist,\\u201d and \\u201c5 shocking realities of being transgender.\\u201d Widespread accusations that the site has transitioned from comedy to identity politics appear to have a solid basis in reality.Follow Allum Bokhari @LibertarianBlue on Twitter.\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 290511}"
