"{\"title\": \"'RimWorld' Developer Tynan Sylvester: 'Don't Listen to What People Say. Watch What They Do' to Find Developers to Trust\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Nate: Right. Now we\\u2019ll\\u00a0dig\\u00a0into\\u00a0RimWorld. Let\\u2019s start with influences. Of course, Dwarf Fortress is an obvious one. Then aside from the character interaction influences from The Sims,\\u00a0I would imagine maybe simulations like\\u00a0Theme\\u00a0Hospital\\u00a0also contributed?Tynan: Well, stepping outside of \\u2014 you covered the games pretty well. The biggest influence is probably Dwarf Fortress. And then there is sort of a genre of games that are similar to that, like The Sims, Prison Architect. Like you mentioned, Theme\\u00a0Hospital is more of a distant cousin. There\\u2019s basically a genre of games where you look down on people, and you kind of can get to know individuals to some degree. I think that would be the primary influence.But stepping outside of the games themselves, for Dwarf Fortress there\\u2019s this whole subculture of people who write stories about what happened in the game. It\\u2019s been around for years. So there\\u2019s these giant long stories where people will pass around their saved games and each one play a year or something in the game. And then each one will write or illustrate things that happened.Nate: Like Boatmurdered.Tynan: Yeah,\\u00a0Boatmurdered, Gemclawed. So, before I made RimWorld I read these stories, and I would say that that is more of the inspiration than\\u00a0the game itself. I played Dwarf Fortress for like eight or ten hours, but I read these stories for many more hours than that. And I really just wanted to make a game that could create a story like this, because it\\u2019s fascinating how people could take something so abstract, and so simple, and imbue it with such meaning \\u2014 which is the same mechanism that people do when they read words on a page in a novel.So, that\\u2019s a huge inspiration for me, but it\\u2019s not an inspiration like \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to do it like this,\\u201d but more \\u201cthis is possible, this is something that works,\\u201d you know? It\\u2019s the same way that Pong could be an inspiration for a shooter, where you\\u2019re like \\u201cpeople are really compelled by shooting things with things, you know?\\u201d Or like Galaga or Space Invaders or something could be an inspiration for an FPS. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cthis works, this is something that works.\\u201d Now, that\\u2019s well mined out I think.Nate: Yeah, I think as an industry, we\\u2019re pretty much covered as far as \\u201cshooting things at things.\\u201d There\\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but it\\u2019s not exactly a new frontier.Tynan: The way people would see a story in a game, and the way the game does things to\\u00a0make that happen \\u2014 to me, that was a huge inspiration. It\\u2019s really those stories that inspired RimWorld more than anything.But beyond that, in terms of the fictional backing and theme, there\\u2019s these great novels by Allistair Reynolds, there\\u2019s Dune from Frank Herbert, and Warhammer 40k, like the slurry of ideas that\\u2019ve embedded themselves in my brain from a lifetime of absorbing these types of things, definitely. But, I mean, it could have been a different fiction.I would say, really, what\\u2019s unique about the game is that it definitely came from those stories \\u2014 stories of Dwarf Fortress, old Starcraft battle reports that people used to write before YouTube was around \\u2014 they would report their Starcraft game with all of these emotional turns, and little stories of like this space marine who was trying to stop the zerglings and he couldn\\u2019t. Creating stories from simple game mechanics I think is just something fascinating to me. Whenever I\\u2019ve seen that, it\\u2019s always been interesting to me, and those are the things that inspired RimWorld.Nate:\\u00a0I\\u2019ve noticed right up front in RimWorld that you have a lot of tools to give the players a chance to choose how they tell their story. You can choose an AI storyteller, you can generate a map and choose where in the world you want to be. With the scenario editor, you can add twists to the mixture \\u2014 I tried a cannibal tribe, for instance.\\u00a0It\\u2019s a lot more robust than \\u201ceasy, medium, or hard.\\u201dTynan: Well, the thing with easy, medium, and hard is that it ultimately revolves around the idea that you\\u2019re going to get your rocks off in this game by triumph, you know? [laughs]Nate: Right.Tynan: You know, so it comes back to the same thing. All those things, those old patterns, they come after the same thing \\u2014 which is okay, it\\u2019s a challenge, the game is about challenge and you want the challenge to be appropriate for you. That\\u2019s part of RimWorld, because there is definitely a challenge, and \\u201ctriumph\\u201d is definitely a part of it, but the reason its set up that way is \\u2014 it accomplishes a few things.There are different types of players who want to have different types of experiences. Or maybe the same person, who just wants to do something different. Some people just like building stuff in the game, so I wanted to create an AI storyteller that would support that. Some people want more of a steady, kind of classic challenge curve, so I created one for that. And some people really just want to try something random, so I created that, too.Nate: Random is by far my favorite. That\\u2019s the Dwarf Fortress way to play. Lots of\\u00a0\\u201cFUN!\\u201dTynan: It\\u00a0just does random stuff like 4 raids at one time, just crazy things. I would say there\\u2019s another aspect of it, which is if you let people choose these things, they will be more accepting of them when they happen. Especially random \\u2014 I wanted random to be part of the game, but I don\\u2019t feel like I just force that on everybody because it\\u2019s unfair. It\\u2019s literally unfair, and kind of ridiculous at times.Nate:\\u00a0But awesome.Tynan: Yeah, like there\\u2019s such value in it, because it creates these absurd extreme situations, which are\\u00a0great for the drama.\\u00a0It\\u2019s great for the intensity. But it also, the way it does that is just by saying, you know, \\u201cfuck your rules, fuck your pacing, fuck your difficulty level. I don\\u2019t give a shit, we\\u2019re just doing something, right? We\\u2019re just doing something totally random.\\u201dAnd to just give that to everyone, I think I\\u2019d get a lot of complaints, because a lot of people would just get killed \\u2014 they\\u2019d build some colony, and fall in love with it, and then get murdered. So I want it to be something that you\\u2019ll choose, and if you choose it, you\\u2019ll accept it. If you know what you\\u2019re getting into, you\\u2019ll accept it and enjoy it. It\\u2019s basically trying to make it acceptable in that sense.And the other thing is, it\\u2019s just basically an easy sort of a cheap way for me to make the game appeal to a broader variety of players. You know, I\\u2019m always looking for something that\\u2019s easy to implement, and essentially a requirement of how I design the game was that everything has to be able to happen at any time. There can\\u2019t be any restrictions. Which means that every event, every incident, has to be made in this really robust way, so that it can occur in context.So your guys can try to get married while there is a pack of man-hunting wolves at the door, or something, right? And the systems will account for this, and they will work together. And once you\\u2019ve done that, it becomes very easy to just sort of throw all those events together in different configurations. And so it\\u2019s just basically a cheap way of trying to push the game system in different ways. Once the game system is robust, why not make it work in different ways?That goes for the biomes too \\u2014 why not play in the steamy jungle, or this frozen wasteland, or a nice forest, or this desert? The game supports all these, because it supports every range of temperature from like -100 degrees Celsius, to +100, where everyone\\u2019s dying of heat stroke, or getting burned and dying. So if it\\u2019s going to support that for seasons, you might as well let people play in different types of environments. Once you built the game properly, it\\u2019s easy to do things that let people create an experience which is different from their last one.Finally, it\\u2019s also about replayability, you know? Once you played your normal storyteller in the forest, maybe you want to try a random one in desert, or an easy one in the ice sheet to get a different type of experience, or go in the jungle and deal with tons of disease. All the systems are there, so let people create an experience that they can own. Basically, it\\u2019s easy to do, so do it, and put the variation in because it\\u2019s already there, so make it work.Nate: So, speaking of storytelling, because that\\u2019s obviously a cornerstone of the game, of this sort of emergent experience \\u2014Tynan: Story generation.Nate: Generation. Yeah, sorry. [laughs] Will we be seeing any kind of combat log or event log that will kind of help us to sort of narrate the stories, so that people can more easily share them?Tynan: Well, I mean\\u00a0it\\u2019s certainly\\u00a0a classic idea, and I think it\\u2019s a strong one. But, as a general rule, I don\\u2019t discuss future features, just because I don\\u2019t know \\u2014 I don\\u2019t have enough knowledge to predict what\\u2019s going to happen. There have been lots of times in the past where I was like, okay\\u2026\\u00a0Just thinking to myself, \\u201cnext month we\\u2019re going to do XYZ,\\u201d and by the time next month rolls around, like a million things have come up. You have better ideas, someone has suggested something better, and there\\u2019s some tax paperwork to do, and it\\u2019s not going to happen, right? So, I don\\u2019t like to speculate.We\\u2019re working on some really exciting stuff. Alpha \\u2014 the next alpha, I think it\\u2019s Alpha 16 \\u2014 is going to be huge. But I can\\u2019t say what that is.\\u00a016 has kind of a mega feature that isn\\u2019t talked about. But no, I can\\u2019t say specifically about the future because I don\\u2019t know. I can tell you something but then, you know, it might not happen and people would get pissed off. I\\u2019ll let people be happy when we can guarantee that their happiness is coming to fruition.Nate:\\u00a0Do you have any idea in your mind of\\u00a0what RimWorld 1.0 looks like?Tynan: Not really. I mean, what I have is this giant design queue of every idea I\\u2019ve thought of, some half-written designs. Basically just a giant Google Doc \\u2014 it\\u2019s like 40 pages now \\u2014 of all this stuff, and I just sort it. And like the idea you mentioned, the combat log, is on there, as well as\\u00a0a million other things. I\\u2019m not going to do all of them, there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to do all of them. I mean, this document grows faster than I can consume it, because it\\u2019s easier to have ideas than to implement them. But, there are certainly some I would like to do.But no, in terms of specific target, I\\u2019ve never really worked that way. It\\u2019s always been \\u2014 to me, it\\u2019s essentially sort of a self-soothing, misleading approach to game design, when you\\u2019re in my business position, to sort of imagine exactly what the final game is going to be. The reality is, as a designer, I don\\u2019t know. If I\\u2019m being honest with myself, I know stuff is going to come up that I don\\u2019t anticipate, and I know that I\\u2019m going to have to change the design around. So I just don\\u2019t bother looking that far into the future. Rather, I just keep all the ideas, and when it\\u2019s time to do something, I do the analysis at that time when I really know what is going on.Nate: With something as open-ended as RimWorld, I can imagine that\\u2019s probably the only way you can do it without making\\u00a0yourself crazy.Tynan: Yeah, it\\u2019s a design approach that I came up with while I was writing the \\u2014 well, I sort of developed over time, but for me it works really well. I\\u2019m not sure it would work well for a big studio project, where you need to have a marketing plan like two years ahead of time, or something like that. But staying nimble like that, and letting the \\u201cfuture you\\u201d make the decision instead of forcing the \\u201cpresent you\\u201d to decide a year ahead of time, leads to much higher quality decisions, in my experience.Nate: So I\\u2019ve observed that as features get added to RimWorld, it seems to be that the game gets essentially \\u201cdarker.\\u201d The more things that the colonists\\u00a0can do, the\\u00a0more ways they can horribly kill themselves.Tynan: [laughing]\\u00a0Well, I guess. I mean, yeah.Nate:\\u00a0Is the increase in complexity just inevitably destructive? Or is there a way to engineer these experiences with a more positive bent? I guess I\\u2019m asking whether that\\u2019s a deliberate design decision, or a by-product?Tynan: Yeah, I know what you mean.\\u00a0I\\u2019ve been reevaluating this recently. What you\\u2019re describing is essentially the result of sort of my internal process, where I\\u2019ve been targeting the things that seem to have the most story drama potential \\u2014Nate: I love that sort of grimdark comedy it creates. I\\u2019m definitely not saying it\\u2019s a negative.Tynan:\\u00a0Oh no, I didn\\u2019t think you were. I think targeting the drama has been effective, because people are telling their stories of like,\\u201d oh my god people have gotten addicted to this, and it was really difficult to get them off, but their wife helped them through it,\\u201d et cetera.We did add relationships and stuff, so colonists do get married, and they also get divorced and stuff. There are definitely happy moments in there. But in terms of the negativity, I would say it\\u2019s a side effect of the pursuit of drama on my part. And now I\\u2019m sort of noticing \\u2014 and this has been brought up a few times \\u2014 a lot of the game mechanics sort of point towards these sorts of grim situations, which is a side effect of the fact that grim situations are really dramatic.Nate:\\u00a0Understandable. A lot of the fun comes from harrowing situations.\\u00a0That sense of peril, hovering on the edge of total catastrophe.Tynan: Yeah, it\\u2019s\\u00a0a lot of fun.\\u00a0There\\u2019s danger and risk and things are at stake, you know? It also ties into game systems, where we physically track if the people are hungry, they\\u2019re tired, they\\u2019re wounded. It\\u2019s harder to track positive aspirational things about a character; those tend to be more, \\u201cI feel self-actualized,\\u201d or something. It\\u2019s very difficult to simulate that.Nate: Yeah, I follow.Tynan: It\\u2019s like Maslow\\u2019s Hierarchy, right? It\\u2019s easy to calculate things at the bottom of the hierarchy. It\\u2019s very easy to write a system to simulate that. But to write a system to simulate the top of Maslow\\u2019s Hierarchy is like, that\\u2019s a strong AI problem. I can\\u2019t do it. So, you have to sort of fudge it.In any case, yeah, so I\\u2019m seeking drama, but it has ended up with these extreme situations \\u2014 most of which won\\u2019t happen in any given game, but yes you can have drug-addicted cannibal psychopath starving murderers, if you want. But this is something I was thinking about, and I was thinking it would be cool if I added some more positive-type emotional valances to the game, just to balance it out, to have a back and forth, sometime in an upcoming update.In terms of emotional valence, the game is really hitting the notes with \\u2014\\u00a0think of the most grim survival movie you can, like The Grey or whatever \\u2014 it\\u2019s definitely got those feelings in it, and they\\u2019re really dramatic, and it\\u2019s great. But, it would also be really cool if it had enough variation to have, like, \\u201crom-com\\u201d emotions in it too, you know? If you could go back and forth.And right now you can, to a degree, because there is a relationship system, and people will get in quirky relationships where one guy shacks up with the mother, and then they break up, and then he marries the daughter. You know, you can imagine some goofy story about this if you want. But, yeah, no. That\\u2019s definitely a good point. It\\u2019s been tipping into dark territory, but I hope to balance that over time.Nate: So we\\u2019ve talked about different aspects you\\u2019re considering, things you\\u2019re progressively tackling, and the forty pages or so of potential features. Do you plan any of this more than one update in advance?Tynan: No.\\u00a0[laughs] Well I have a lifetime worth of content \\u2014 it\\u2019s all there swirling around, right? Uh, no. Planning? The word \\u201cplan\\u201d implies that you\\u2019re going to do it, like you really think you\\u2019re going to do it; there\\u2019s a very high percentage chance you\\u2019re going to do it.Nate: Right, that\\u2019s where I\\u2019m going with this. [laughs]Tynan: Which I don\\u2019t do. In fact, I\\u2019ll keep that to under two weeks if I can.\\u00a0We might add more features to the next alpha, or we might just release it as soon as the current workload is done. There\\u2019s just no point; why plan, why try to guess at the future and then lock yourself into some specific course of action? Just decide later, because you\\u2019re going to know more, right? And you\\u2019re going to have a better decision if you just do it later. So, let \\u201cfuture you\\u201d decide, you know? Because \\u201cpresent you\\u201d is an idiot.It would be like if I let my life decisions be made by the 5-years-ago version of me; he was an idiot, he didn\\u2019t have all of\\u00a0my\\u00a0experiences. So, I try to decide as close as I can \\u2014 essentially decide things with as much knowledge as possible, which implies deciding things as late as possible. Which, I can do because it\\u2019s an indie company with just a few people, and we have that kind of nimbleness. It\\u2019s an advantage of being indie, and it\\u2019s one that I do play to the hilt, every time.Nate:\\u00a0How\\u2019s that been working out for you so far? The Steam release, obviously, has been pretty successful. Steam Spy\\u2019s latest estimate is over 320,000 on that platform alone, but you\\u2019d been selling it well before that. Was there a big jump once you released to Steam?Tynan: Oh, yeah, definitely. I would say sales probably went up over tenfold, I think, when it went on Steam. Obviously it did fall down; it was crazy in the first few days, and in the first week, it\\u2019s gone down quite a bit since release. But the game still is sort of clinging to in-and-out of the Top 10 sellers on Steam. I think it was in the Top Ten today and yesterday. And this is over two months after the release, and it\\u2019s not even a final game; it\\u2019s early access.So, I\\u2019m pretty damn happy with it. I mean, what can I say? It\\u2019s been doing really well, it\\u2019s been doing great. So, it\\u2019s a fantastic validation that somebody likes what we\\u2019re doing here. And, thank you to everyone for that. What else can I say? It\\u2019s been doing really well.Nate:\\u00a0Does that level of validation make you want to try new projects, or are you sticking with RimWorld for the foreseeable future?Tynan: Well, again, I don\\u2019t know, right?Nate: That\\u2019s a question for \\u201cfuture you.\\u201dTynan: Yeah, seriously. It\\u2019s funny. I mean, every time I do an AMA on Reddit, or I did one on Kotaku last week \\u2014 Literally half the questions are, \\u201cIs this going to happen? Is this going to happen?\\u201d I\\u2019m like \\u201cI don\\u2019t know! I don\\u2019t know! I don\\u2019t know the future, guys.\\u201d I\\u2019m much better at talking about the present and the past, because otherwise I\\u2019m just guessing at it all.Nate: I think people get really jumpy because a huge percentage of early access games just sort of fade into nothingness. It makes us\\u00a0cagey. We\\u00a0want to know what\\u2019s going to happen.Tynan: And I think it\\u2019s totally pointless, too. Because you can ask for giant promises, and a developer can give you big promises. It doesn\\u2019t fucking mean it\\u2019s going to happen, you know?Nate:\\u00a0It\\u2019s true.Tynan: In fact, I would say, you should look for the developers who don\\u2019t make those giant promises. Because the ones who are like, \\u2018Yeah and it\\u2019s going to have sharks, and it\\u2019s going to have nuclear bombs!\\u2019Nate:\\u00a0More sharks and bombs than you can ever potentially see. Eighteen quintillion \\u2014Tynan:\\u00a0[laughs] I\\u2019m not naming anyone,\\u00a0okay?Nate: [laughs]Tynan: But the bigger the promises, the more likely they are to be disconnected from reality. So, I think an intelligent gamer who wants to find a developer they can trust, should look for someone who\\u2019s making measured statements, and is not saying things that are too distant from reality. Because they really shouldn\\u2019t be making those claims, because they really don\\u2019t know. And that\\u2019s what I try to uphold all this time.Obviously, there\\u2019s a lot of new players coming into the RimWorld sphere \\u2014 especially recently, with the Steam release \\u2014 but it still surprises me sometimes when I get people who are like, \\u201cOh, are you going to abandon the game? Are you just going to drift away?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, guys I\\u2019ve been doing this for three years! Every single month, somebody\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re going to abandon the game now,\\u201d and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, tell us what\\u2019s going to happen. Otherwise, it\\u2019s obvious you\\u2019re just leaving.\\u201dAnd every time I release something and it goes great and there\\u2019s a new update, all those criticisms are essentially silenced and proven to be wrong. But, then there\\u2019s always a new generation of people who are like, \\u201cOh he\\u2019s going to abandon it this time.\\u201d I\\u2019m like guys, please just look at the record.Nate: It\\u2019s a very paranoid market.Tynan: Go look at the record; I\\u2019ve done exactly everything I ever said I was going to do, and more on the game. I\\u2019m pretty much one for one on promises in RimWorld. So, I\\u2019m saying I\\u2019m going to keep developing it, and it\\u2019s going to be finished in a satisfactory way. So, that\\u2019s going to happen. That\\u2019s all I can say. I really do value credibility, and I think it\\u2019s really important to be serious about saying things that you know are actually true, or will become true.I take that very seriously, which is part of why I don\\u2019t give a lot of speculation about future events, because I don\\u2019t really know. Yeah, I try to build that up, and I think that the players who have been around for a while will know that. But, yeah, all I can say to anyone else is, \\u201cDon\\u2019t ask me about the future; I\\u2019d rather you look at my past.\\u201dNate:\\u00a0I do agree that the past is perhaps the strongest predictor of the future.Tynan: Well, I mean, there\\u2019s the old adage, right? Don\\u2019t listen to what people say. Watch what they do. And that\\u2019s how you really get to know who people are.\\u00a0\\u00a0I want to once again thank Tynan Sylvester for taking the time for such an extensive discussion, and for his candor.
