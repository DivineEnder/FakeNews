"{\"title\": \"Exclusive - Wendy Davis at Planned Parenthood Fundraiser: Abortion of 7-Pound Baby \\u2018Never Happens\\u2019\", \"content\": \"When unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis (D) was asked this week why it was acceptable to abort a seven-pound baby, she responded, \\u201cThat never happens. It never happens. It really never happens.\\u201dAs heard in a video taken by an anonymous citizen journalist who provided the recording exclusively to Breitbart News, Davis continued:And, the only time that late term abortions occur is when something has gone horribly wrong and either the mother\\u2019s life is in danger or the child\\u2019s life is in a very precarious situation. What we can\\u2019t ever know is what people are dealing with when they make those personal choices. And, it\\u2019s not right for us to step into their shoes, is what I tell people.Davis headlined a Planned Parenthood fundraising luncheon in Dearborn, Michigan Monday, when she was asked the question 2016 GOP contender Sen. Rand Paul suggested reporters ask Democratic National Committee chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.As Breitbart News reported in April, Paul was asked during a press conference in New Hampshire, \\u201cSenator, the DNC is picking up on comments you made with AP this morning on abortion, and I just wanted to know where you stand on exemptions\\u2014should there be any exemptions for abortion or no?\\u201dPaul responded:You know, here\\u2019s the question. We always seem to have the debate way over here on what are the exact details of exemptions and where it starts. Why don\\u2019t we ask the DNC if it\\u2019s okay to kill a 7-pound baby in the uterus.You go back and you ask Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz \\u00a0if she\\u2019s okay with killing a 7-pound baby that\\u2019s not born yet. You ask her when life begins and you ask her if she\\u2019s willing to protect life. When you get an answer from Debbie, get back to me.Wasserman Schultz responded to Paul by issuing a statement that dodged the question and, as is typical of pro-abortion politicians, reframed it as a women\\u2019s personal choice question without any mention of the unborn child involved:I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved. Period. End of story.Now your turn, Senator Paul.\\u00a0We know you want to allow government officials like yourself to make this decision for women \\u2014 but do you stand by your opposition to any exceptions, even when it comes to rape, incest, or life of the mother?\\u00a0Or do we just have different definitions of \\u201cpersonal liberty\\u201d?\\u00a0And I\\u2019d appreciate it if you could respond without \\u201cshushing\\u201d me.Davis, a former Texas state senator, was hurled into the national political spotlight in 2013 when she donned a pair of pink sneakers and \\u2013 with a rowdy mob of abortion advocates for support \\u2013 filibustered a bill that was ultimately signed into law, banning abortions in the state after 20 weeks of pregnancy.Two\\u00a0months after her famous filibuster, Davis channeled House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who referred to abortion as \\u201csacred ground.\\u201d Davis repeated the phrase, one\\u00a0usually reflective of strongly held religious beliefs, and said abortion was a fundamental necessity for women\\u2019s \\u201cliberty.\\u201dIn November of 2013, however, Davis seemed to flip-flop, stating she was \\u201cpro-life.\\u201d And the following February, as a candidate for governor of Texas, she told the Dallas Morning News that she supports a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, although she had filibustered a bill that ultimately did exactly that.Abortion was not the only important election issue on which Davis backtracked. As the candidate whose gubernatorial campaign was considered one of the election year\\u2019s most catastrophic, Davis eventually acknowledged in January of this year that she was faking support for gun rights in order to obtain votes.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 235092}"
