"{\"title\": \"Golden Globes: In Which a Big Hollywood Writer Champions George Clooney - Twice!\", \"content\": \"It\\u2019s the most wonderful time of the  year! Award show season is here, and it\\u2019s the time when I get all  excited and giddy for the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, and  the Academy Awards.The 69th Annual Golden Globes starts at 8 p.m. EST tonight and will be hosted again by British comedian Ricky  Gervais. I can\\u2019t wait to see who he offends this time.\\n\\n[youtube CWHNXJ1K4yA nolink]Let\\u2019s take a look at who\\u2019s nominated  this year for Hollywood Foreign Press Association\\u2019s Golden Globes.  Favorites of the HFPA this year are \\u201cThe Artist\\u201d and George Clooney. I\\u2019ve gone through the nominations and picked who I would like to see win and who will most likely win.\\n\\nBest Motion Picture \\u2013 Drama\\n The Descendants\\nThe Help\\nHugo\\nThe Ides of March\\nMoneyball\\nWar Horse\\u201cThe Help\\u201d was one of the most  incredibly moving films of the year and featured a stellar, talented  cast. It was also one of the best book adaptations I have ever seen. But  I think the HFPA is in favor of Clooney this year.  My Pick: The Help Who Will Win: The DescendantsBest Motion Picture \\u2013 Comedy or Musical 50/50\\nThe Artist\\nBridesmaids\\nMidnight in Paris\\nMy Week with MarilynI really did enjoy all of these films. But if I had to pick the BEST one, there is no comparison.  My Pick: The Artist Who Will Win: The ArtistBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture \\u2013 Drama\\nGeorge Clooney,  The Descendants\\nBrad Pitt,  Moneyball\\nRyan Gosling,  The Ides of March\\nMichael Fassbender,  Shame\\nLeonardo DiCaprio,  J. EdgarClooney had his fair share of  ups and downs and played a character who he\\u2019s never played before:  someone who\\u2019s been cheated on. My Pick: George Clooney Who Will Win: George ClooneyBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture \\u2013 Drama\\nGlenn Close,  Albert Nobbs\\nViola Davis,  The Help\\nRooney Mara,  The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\nMeryl Streep,  The Iron Lady\\nTilda Swinton,  We Need to Talk About KevinIt\\u2019s so hard to pick between Davis  and Mara. Davis is an all-star who does deserve the recognition, but  Mara had the wow factor in \\u201cDragon Tattoo.\\u201d My Pick: Split vote between Viola Davis and Rooney Mara Who Will Win: Viola DavisBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture \\u2013 Comedy or Musical\\nJean Dujardin,  The Artist\\nBrendan Gleeson, The Guard\\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt, 50/50\\nRyan Gosling, Crazy, Stupid, Love.\\nOwen Wilson, Midnight in ParisJGL produced the BEST performance of his career and I loved him in \\u201c50/50,\\u201d but French actor Jean Dujardin won at Cannes and won me over in \\u201cThe Artist.\\u201d My Pick: Jean Dujardin Who Will Win: Jean DujardinBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture \\u2013 Comedy or Musical\\nJodie Foster,  Carnage\\nCharlize Theron,  Young Adult\\nKristen Wiig,  Bridesmaids\\nMichelle Williams,  My Week With Marilyn\\nKate Winslet,  CarnageAlthough I loved Williams\\u2019 performance in \\u201cMarilyn,\\u201d  I\\u2019m not sure why the film fits in the Comedy or Musical category, as it  is a vulnerable portrait of Monroe\\u2019s life at the height of her career. Wiig proved herself as an actress in \\u201cBridesmaids,\\u201d and it was one  of my favorite films of the year.  My Pick: Kristen Wiig Who Will Win: Michelle WilliamsBest Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture\\nKenneth Branagh,  My Week With Marilyn\\nAlbert Brooks,  Drive\\nJonah Hill,  Moneyball\\nChristopher Plummer,  Beginners\\nViggo Mortensen, A Dangerous MethodSomeone needs to win for \\u201cDrive,\\u201d and Brooks  played one mean, nasty villain. But the HFPA will probably give it to  Plummer because he\\u2019s been around for, well, a while. My Pick: Albert Brooks Who Will Win: Christopher PlummerBest Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture\\nShailene Woodley,  The Descendants\\nOctavia Spencer,  The Help\\nJanet McTeer, Albert Nobbs\\nBerenice Bejo, The Artist\\nJessica Chastain, The HelpTough. So many great performances in the supporting category this past year. I\\u2019m split between all of them really. \\u201cThe Artist\\u201d could potentially do a Golden Globes sweep, and the Globe may go to  talented newcomer Berenice Bejo. However, I remember being super taken  with Spencer\\u2019s performance as Minnie in \\u201cThe Help.\\u201d My Pick: Octavia Spencer Who Will Win: Octavia SpencerBest Director\\nWoody Allen,  Midnight in Paris\\nGeorge Clooney,  The Ides of March\\nMichel Hazanavicius,  The Artist\\nAlexander Payne,  The Descendants\\nMartin Scorsese,  Hugo\\u201cThe Ides of March\\u201d was  beautifully shot, and the way it was shot made the film all the more  suspenseful. I was impressed with Clooney, but Hazanavicius also created  a timeless masterpiece by shooting in B&W with some amazing camera work.
