"{\"article_id\": 239932, \"title\": \"Media Sets Gun Control Narrative, Shuts Down Mental Health Debate\", \"content\": \"Witness the media art of Whack-a-Mole:\\u2013\\u2013Not only are CNN and Soledad making sure Rep. Bono Mack pays a heavy price every time she brings up a solution inconvenient to their agenda (mental health, air marshals); they\\u2019re also sending a not-too-subtle message to others that this is not what we are going to talk about. In other words, anyone who dares talk about anything other than gun control is going to get publicly whack-a-moled. You\\u2019ve been warned, conservatives! Like Rep. Nadler and every other leftist in the country, CNN wants to make our country less safe through the taking of guns, because the overall goal is the same: to make us less self-reliant and more dependent on the government for everything \\u2014 including our own personal safety and our ability to protect our loved ones. But if the media\\u2019s going to maximize their effectiveness in pursuing this goal, it simply must make sure that no other attractive ideas or policies are discussed or debated, other than gun control. The media must shut down debate and shape The Narrative in a way that makes it appear to the public as though there\\u2019s only one consensus and solution to this problem \\u2014 their solution.Furthermore, anyone who bristles against this idea will be treated with public contempt and hostility (like Rep. Bono Mack), and as though they\\u2019re some kind of right-wing nut who doesn\\u2019t care about people. We\\u2019ve seen the media do the same with other left-wing crusades; same-sex marriage, abortion, and Global Warming. Watch the video again and what you\\u2019ll see is CNN using Soledad O\\u2019Brien to shut down debate as though she already has all the facts. One day after this country\\u2019s worst tragedy in a decade, CNN is already drawing a line that says this is \\u201csettled science.\\u201d During the presidential election last month, we saw the media play this same whack-a-mole game with Libya. Whether it was Mitt Romney or anyone else, if you raised the subject of Libya in a way that was harmful to the media\\u2019s agenda (reelecting Obama), you were pulverized. Today the craven and opportunistic media sees an opportunity to further a different agenda. But their fascist tactics remain the same. \\u00a0Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \", \"source_id\": 2}"
