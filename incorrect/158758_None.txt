"{\"title\": \"Sperm Banks Tighten Security Policy Amid Zika Panic\", \"content\": \"The British Fertility Society asked people who traveled to areas with Zika, mainly South America and the Caribbean, not to donate sperm for 28 days.The California Cryobank will not allow donations from anyone who traveled to those countries or \\u201chave had sex with someone who has traveled there within the past month.\\u201d Doctors must report any patient who left the U.S. or Canada. New policy also includes checking all \\u201crecords on where sperm donors have traveled over the past year to see if any have visited the nearly 30 countries and territories where the virus has caused outbreaks.\\u201dOwen Davis, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said all banks \\u201ckeep donations in \\u2018frozen quarantine\\u2019 for six months to make sure specimens are disease-free.\\u201dAedes aegypti mosquitoes carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations. (Chile and Canada are the exceptions.) They also carry dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya. Doctors found the disease in one infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy, causing a small skull. This leads to serious mental disabilities. The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the Zika outbreak, however, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.The Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) confirmed a person received the virus after \\u201csexual contact with an individual with Zika.\\u201d\\u201cNow that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,\\u201d explained Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director. \\u201cNext to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any sexually-transmitted infections.\\u201dHarvey Stern, medical director at Fairfax Cryobank, told USA Today\\u00a0that scientists do not \\u201cknow how long the Zika virus can survive in semen, or whether the virus is present in the semen of men without symptoms.\\u201dBrazil confirmed two cases of Zika infections through blood transfusions in Campinas.Campinas Health Secretary C\\u00e1rmino de Souza said the government were not previously able to confirm the infections \\u201cbecause they were initially suspected of being infected with dengue, another mosquito-borne virus.\\u201d The two patients received the blood transfusions in early 2015.\\u00a0The Wall Street Journal reported:The first case involved a liver-transplant recipient who contracted Zika through blood donated in March 2015. The second was a gunshot victim who tested positive for Zika after receiving multiple blood transfusions; he later died of his wounds, not the Zika virus, Campinas health officials said.The officials confirmed Zika in the donor\\u2019s blood on January 28, 2016.Another donor from May tested positive for Zika, but \\u201cthe recipient of the contaminated blood has not developed symptoms of the virus.\\u201dThe American Red Cross urged people not to donate blood \\u201cif they traveled to Latin America or the Caribbean in the past 28 days.\\u201d They advised people who have donated blood to alert the organization if they develop Zika symptoms.\\u201cThe American Red Cross is dedicated to providing the safest, most reliable blood products possible to patients in need,\\u201d stated Susan Stramer, vice president of scientific affairs. \\u201cThe Red Cross continues to use safety measures to protect the blood supply from Zika and other mosquito-borne viruses.\\u201dSpokeswoman Jodi Sheedy told Breitbart News the organization asks people who develop symptoms to immediately contact them within 14 days so they can quarantine the blood.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 158758}"
