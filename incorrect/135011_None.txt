"{\"title\": \"Criminals and Terrorists Account for ONE THIRD of Overall Victories Against UK in European Court of Human Rights\", \"content\": \"Of the 297 claimants who won cases against the UK between 1975 and 2015, 14 were terrorists, 35 were criminals, and 45 were prisoners. The figures, which include murderers, IRA gunmen, and Islamic terror suspects, therefore make up nearly 32 percent of all cases in which Strasbourg finds against the UK.The figures were released by RightsInfo, a pro-migration\\u00a0campaigning group which seeks to put a positive spin on the work of the ECHR, within a new series of infographics designed to bring \\u201cto light some important facts.\\u201dRights Info have released a graphic showing that one third of those who won cases against the UK were terrorists and criminalsHitting back at the negative spin of newspapers such as The Sun, and The Daily Mail, the group asserts: \\u201cTwo thirds\\u00a0of the people who have won cases against the UK since 1959 (sic) are not terrorists, criminals or prisoners. Again, contrary to what you might have read in the newspapers.\\u201dHowever, it appears not to have realised that this means one third of people who win cases against the UK are terrorists, criminals and prisoners.That fact has not escaped the notice of Ukip\\u2019s deputy leader, Paul Nuttall MEP, who told the Express: \\u201cIt\\u2019s clear that the European Convention on Human Rights has spiralled out of control.\\u201cIt was meant to be about protecting Europe\\u2019s citizens against dictatorship and fascism, not forcing us to give votes to criminals or protecting the rights of terrorists.\\u201dCommons justice committee chairman Bob Neill has also slammed the figures, accusing the court of \\u201cmission creep\\u201d, and saying that it \\u201chas gone well beyond what any sensible person would say is real human rights\\u201d.Many of the court\\u2019s judges are \\u201cfrom countries with questionable human rights and with very little judicial experience,\\u201d he said, adding: \\u201cPolitical pressure groups take advantage of that naivety which costs the British taxpayer considerable sums of money.\\u201dCiting another \\u201cfact\\u201d, the group asserts: \\u201cThe UK only loses around\\u00a01 out of 100 cases\\u00a0at the court (card 9) The Daily Mail and Sun have reported that the UK loses\\u00a03 out of 4\\u00a0and\\u00a03 out of 5\\u00a0cases at the court respectively.\\u201dBut the group\\u2019s own figures prove that The Sun at least is correct. On its first card in the series, RightsInfo explains that, as anyone can bring a case to the court, the court first sifts the cases, throwing about 85 per cent of claims out before they make it to a panel of judges.Another infographic from Rights Info, showing that the UK loses 3 in 5 casesRightsInfo then lists the UK third in terms of countries that win the most cases which go to full judgement, informing us that Denmark wins 67 per cent of her cases, Sweden 59 per cent and the UK 41 per cent.That statistic is repeated in the next card, which reads: \\u201cUK is doing well with 41 per cent of cases in its favour\\u201d. Again, that means that 59 per cent of cases, or three in five, go against the UK.\\u00a0Follow Donna Rachel Edmunds on Twitter: Follow @Donna_R_E or e-mail to: dedmunds@breitbart.com\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 135011}"
