"{\"title\": \"One Year Later, Gitmo's Still Up and Running: Where's the MSM Outrage?\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"One of the first things that Barack Obama did after being swept into office on the wings of \\u201chopenchange\\u201d was to sign an executive order that would close the terrorist detainee facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. President Obama gave a one-year deadline after which, he triumphantly promised us, the facility would be closed. Well, we are at one year plus ten days after the signing of the order and Gitmo is still open. Yet few stories expressing outrage about this lapsed promise have made the rounds in the Old Media.On January 22, 2009, Obama signed the Executive Order that gravely asserted that Gitmo would be closed \\u201cno later than 1 year from the date of this order.\\u201d That was January 22, 2009. It is now February 3, 2010. I\\u2019d say a year and ten days after the order was signed just might constitute more than \\u201cno later than one year,\\u201d wouldn\\u2019t you?\\n\\nNaturally, last year when Obama signed this order the Old Media covered it quite heavily. It was big news and was represented as an example of Obama\\u2019s fulfilling a campaign promise. All one need do is type \\u201cclose Guantanamo executive order\\u201d into Google and page after page of Old Media coverage of the signing of the EO will be discovered.Certainly the Old Media was all aflutter over the signing in 2009. The Washington Post, for instance, trumpeted that Obama\\u2019s action, \\u201cdrew praise from human rights groups as well as politicians and statesmen around the globe.\\u201d MSNBC breathlessly informed its readers that, \\u201cPresident Barack Obama on Thursday moved quickly to undo a contentious Bush administration national security program\\u2026\\u201d For its part, the AP had a report posted on the CBS News page with a headline screaming that, \\u201cObama Upends Bush, Will Close Guantanamo.\\u201d And that\\u2019s just the news, not the commentariat. Treatment was even more adulatory by political commentators throughout the Old Media.Again, however, we are now ten days past the deadline that the President set for his momentous \\u201cupending of Bush.\\u201d One might think that the Old Media would be filled with finger-waggers sternly taking President Obama to task for missing his own deadline. One would think that the commentariat would be excoriating Obama for his obvious prevarication on Gitmo.It isn\\u2019t that the Old Media has ignored the missed deadline. One can certainly find a few stories about the issue. But the level of coverage is in no way comparable. According to the Google metrics, typing in \\u201cclose Guantanamo executive order\\u201d gets 140,000 hits. But typing in \\u201cclose Guantanamo missed deadline\\u201d only nets 30,400 hits. That\\u2019s quite a disparity.But I find the most interesting aspect of the missed deadline coverage is the lack of attacks on Obama\\u2019s integrity over it all. Can anyone honestly say that the kid-glove treatment that this missed deadline is receiving today would have been afforded President Bush if he had done something similar?So, where are the outraged comments by Keith Olbermann, where\\u2019s the snarky jokes by John Stewart? How about the tsking from the chicks on The View? Where\\u2019s the Rachel Maddow smack-down? How about a double-barreled Frank Rich drive-by? Is Joe Klein apoplectic yet? Is there not even a MoDo explosion in the pages of the New York Times, or is she chillin\\u2019 somewhere?Some of these folks have mentioned the missed deadline, but the level of vituperation these same people had for George W. Bush\\u2019s Gitmo policies is noticeably absent in discussing Obama\\u2019s blatantly missed deadline for closing it, the same deadline they so lovingly reported only a year ago.\", \"article_id\": 250630}"
