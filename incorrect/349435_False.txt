"{\"title\": \"U.S. forces get more freedom to strike militants in Somalia \", \"content\": \"WASHINGTON\\u2014President Donald Trump has given the U.S. military more latitude to go after al Qaeda militants in east Africa, as part of an expanding global campaign against Islamic extremists, American officials said Thursday.The Pentagon proposal signed by Mr. Trump Wednesday night allows the U.S. military to more aggressively target al-Shabaab fighters in Somalia, where American special operations forces are working with Somali soldiers.Under former President \\n      Barack Obama, \\n       U.S. forces in east Africa could carry out airstrikes and joint raids against the extremist group only on a case-by-case basis. Decisions by U.S. forces on the ground required high-level approval.Now, Mr. Trump has officially declared part of Somalia an \\u201carea of active hostilities,\\u201d allowing the U.S. military to strike al-Shabaab\\u2014an al Qaeda affiliated extremist group that controls a large southern swath of the country\\u2014with less oversight from Washington.\\u201cIf we\\u2019re going to be able to do this effectively, efficiently and go after the enemy when we need to and do this trans-regionally, you can\\u2019t have a centralized process out of DC,\\u201d said a senior U.S. military official.The revised rules also place fewer restrictions on the U.S. military\\u2019s targeting policies. It will have new freedom to help Somali forces launch offensive raids and airstrikes against the militants, U.S. officials said.The change is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to give the U.S. military more leeway to fight extremist groups around the world, marking a shift from the Obama administration, when some military officials felt constrained by the White House.The Pentagon is putting more forces into Syria to fight Islamic State, stepping up airstrikes against the militant group in Mosul, Iraq, and working more closely with Saudi Arabia to target Iran-backed extremists in Yemen.Somalia is at the forefront of the U.S. counterterrorism campaign in Africa. Fighters with al-Shabaab have carried out attacks against African Union forces, oceanfront restaurants and police stations. In 2013, the group attacked a mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing more than 60 people.The decision on Somalia, military officials said, is a reflection of the Pentagon\\u2019s expanding campaign against Islamic militants.\\u201cWe can\\u2019t just fight this fight in region to region, wrap one region up and move to the next region,\\u201d said one senior U.S. military official. \\u201cThere has to be some simultaneity here, and it clearly is a trans-regional problem, and you can\\u2019t do it sequentially.\\u201dThe move in east Africa comes as the Pentagon is providing more intelligence and logistic support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates fighting Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen. The Pentagon has also sent more forces to Syria and Iraq as the U.S. military tries to deliver a crippling blow to Islamic State\\u2019s two major strongholds, Mosul and Raqqa, Syria.U.S. military officials said the new approvals from Mr. Trump aren\\u2019t expected to lead to a bigger American presence in Somalia, where a few dozen special operations forces currently operate at any one time.U.S. officials say the president\\u2019s approval of the Pentagon plan, first reported by the \\n        New York Times\\n        ,\\n       does not ease current guidelines on minimizing civilian casualties.Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, told Pentagon reporters last week that he wanted more \\u201cflexibility\\u201d in Somalia, but that he wanted to ensure that the decisions wouldn\\u2019t lead to more civilian casualties.\\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to power-down the decision making authority in order to be responsive,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo it\\u2019s very, very important. And obviously the cardinal rule in these types of engagement is to not make more enemies than you already have. And I think we go to great pains to do that.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 22245, \"article_id\": 349435}"
