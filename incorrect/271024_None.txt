"{\"title\": \"In Nevada Senate Race, For the Anti-Tea Party Media, It's 'Game On' For Reid vs. Angle\", \"content\": \"The widespread feeling among the national media is that Sen. Harry Reid has the candidate he wants in Sharron Angle\\u2014to Harry, I would say be careful what you wish for.Here in Nevada, we know Harry\\u2026 and books have been written on the damage he has done to our state and the nation in his 24 years in the Senate. Few know Sharron yet, and Democrats will work hard to define her as horribly as they can.Let me say this, what Angle did in Nevada is nothing short of remarkable. I watched this race closely (having worked with one of her opponents in the race) and saw Angle in action. I know the good and the bad. There is no perfect candidate. Races are relative. All that matters is that you are better than your opponent.The Black Hawks had to beat the Flyers to win the Cup, not the \\u201977 Canadiens. I mention that because many times in elections people lament that their candidate didn\\u2019t make it or that Mitt Romney didn\\u2019t buy a home in Lake Tahoe and run against Reid (which was actually rumored early on).I\\u2019ve sat on panels and debated issues with Sharron. She\\u2019s tough, respectful and rock solid conservative. For that, she will be derided by the leftist media, which is already itching to destroy her  candidacy  by painting her as a kook.\\n\\n[youtube AFzfmLRJxzY nolink]Oh, she has some \\u201ccrazy\\u201d ideas\\u2014like phasing out Social Security, getting rid of the Department of Education and keeping the Yucca Mountain Nuke Dump open to reprocess fuel.   Of course, the left and their media will pounce on these ideas like a wise guy on an open craps table. They have already begun the feast, ignoring the fact that Nevadans know Social Security has serious problems, we\\u2019d like to keep our cash for our own education, and Yucca means jobs and an answer to our energy issues. Nothing kooky about any of those ideas.Bill Clinton has already begun the fight for Harry. He was here this week making the sales pitch.  Clinton compared Angle to \\u201cwhere\\u2019s Waldo\\u201d as she takes some time off from a tough primary to prepare for a brutal general. He said:\\n\\nI might hide out too if I said Harry Reid was wrong to spend 20 years to try to free us of all that nuclear waste, I think we outta bring everybody\\u2019s here and recycle it right here on sight in Nevada\\u2013that\\u2019ll be great for our tourism industry.I\\u2019m not sure who\\u2019s more disconnected from Nevada\\u2014Bill Clinton or Harry Reid? I imagine Reid will bring President Obama here soon and we\\u2019ll have the \\u201cOut of Touch Trio\\u201d telling Nevada what it should do.I know Sharron, and she is going to welcome this fight. She needs back-up, and support, every candidate does. This will be an epic battle and she is up for it.Now the question is: is the conservative media ready to back her up?\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 271024}"
