"{\"title\": \"Syrian Kurdish Militia Blocks Peshmerga from Rojava, Sparking Intra-Kurdish Row\", \"content\": \"\\u201cIraqi Kurds have said that the PYD cannot be considered a group that represents all Kurds in Syria and that the group\\u2019s legitimacy has declined for them,\\u201d writes the Daily Sabah.\\u00a0\\u201cThe PYD has forced 13 Syrian Kurdish parties to leave PYD territory. All of these parties are represented in the Syrian National Coalition that supports the territorial integrity of a free Syria.\\u201dTwo incidents in particular have angered Kurdish opposition leaders. Last week, the PYD banned the Rudaw news agency from operating in the area of Kobani, a strategically vital border city that Kurds defended from a prolonged and brutal siege by the Islamic State. Rudaw is not even allowed to publish work from freelance journalists in the area.The PYD was remarkably candid about why it the ban was imposed: \\u201cThe decision will be in place unless Rudaw changes its politics.\\u201dRudaw called this \\u201can old-fashioned and ideological perspective on media work\\u201d in a statement, vowing\\u00a0it would \\u201cnot stop its duty under pressure of any kind,\\u201d and would not allow the ban to \\u201ccreate a gap between Rudaw and the people of Kobani.\\u201d\\u201cRudaw believes that Syrian Kurdistan needs to portray an image of democracy and freedom to the world to attract the international community\\u2019s support, but also to gain a guarantee of the existence of their entity at a time of huge changes in the Middle East. By banning free and professional media the canton shows it violates freedom, despite the fact that it is also calling for freedom,\\u201d said the news agency.Opposition groups, including the Socialist Party of Kurdistan (PSK) and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), condemned the ban as a \\u201cviolation of freedom of expression and freedom of media,\\u201d comparing it to something the \\u201cinvaders of Kurdistan\\u201d \\u2014 i.e. ISIS \\u2014 would do.The other controversial move by the PYD involved blocking the return\\u00a0to Syria of some 6,000 fighters from the\\u00a0peshmerga\\u00a0militia trained by\\u00a0the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq.The KRG angrily accused the PYD of becoming a wing of the Assad regime in Damascus. Mustafa Shafik, an adviser to the prime minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government, said the PYD \\u201csigned a strategic agreement with the Syrian regime,\\u201d and has been \\u201cworking on applying it for four years.\\u201dKava Azizi of the Kurdish National Council is quoted by\\u00a0Daily Sabah\\u00a0saying the Baathist regime of Bashar Assad \\u201ccontrols this organization according to its own interest.\\u201d Azizi then looped in the United Nations\\u2019 permanent representative in Syria, Bashar Jaafari, who said the PYD was supported by both the American and Syrian governments.Even the brother of PYD leader Salih Muslim, Dr. Mustafa Muslim, claimed that Russia has been using the PYD as a pawn against Turkey and challenged the PYD\\u2019s image of Turkey as implacable enemies of the Syrian Kurds.This would seem like a difficult argument to make when Turkey is actively\\u00a0shelling\\u00a0Syrian Kurds, although the idea seems to be that the PYD has become too close to the Kurdish PKK separatists of Turkey, dragging the rest of Syrian Kurds into a fight with Turkey they would rather not have. The\\u00a0Daily Sabah\\u00a0quotes peshmerga commanders complaining about PKK units getting in the way of their operations against ISIS.As for the Russians, a recent op-ed from Tahrir Institute fellow Hassan Hassan for the\\u00a0New York Times\\u00a0criticized Washington for abandoning its other allies among the Syrian rebellion in favor of the Kurdish YPG, which has been described as \\u201cworking with the Americans in Kurdish areas east of the Euphrates River and with the Russians to the west of it.\\u201dHassan castigated the YPG (which has always seemed much more enthusiastic about fighting a defense war against the Islamic State than rebelling against the Assad regime in Damascus) of \\u201ctightening the noose on other American allies,\\u201d and driving a wedge into NATO by alienating Turkey.He went so far as to quote Amnesty International accusing the YPG of \\u201cwar crimes,\\u201d including the forced relocation of Arab civilians, in a quest to unite the Kurdish cantons of Syria under its control.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 158314}"
