"{\"title\": \"Triple-Amputee Air Force Veteran Faces Bureaucratic Mess with Obama VA Dept\", \"content\": \"Kolfage was on his second deployment with the U.S. Air Force serving in Balad, Iraq in August 2004, when\\u2013on Sept. 11 that year\\u2013a rocket landed just feet from him. \\u201cIt was basically an artillery round, like being shot by a tank,\\u201d he said in an interview on Thursday evening with Breitbart News. \\u201cThe thing landed like right next to, like two feet away from me, and it blew off my legs instantly and my hand.\\u201dHe was unconscious for some time after that, including while he was transferred to Walter Reed military hospital in Bethesda, MD. \\u201cEverybody thought I was going to die,\\u201d Kolfage said.But Kolfage survived the attack; he is the most severely wounded airman to survive any war in American history. \\u201cI was at Walter Reed for about a year,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAfter I left Walter Reed, I continued my job with the Air Force but as a civilian down here at Davis-Montham Air Force Base [in Tucson, AZ]. I was a base security manager for two years.\\u201dAfter some time at Davis-Montham Air Force Base, Kolfage retired from the military to return to school to pursue a degree in architecture. He graduates in a couple months. From the VA, he receives a monthly check. \\u201cI am retired\\u2013medically retired,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOnce I retired, they give me what is called a disability compensation. It\\u2019s basically blood money for what happened to me. I get a monthly check, I get it for life no matter what. If I die, my daughter and wife get it.\\u201dKolfage was married before sustaining his injuries, and those who receive such checks get an increased amount if they are married. In early 2011, however, he and his first wife divorced. \\u201cI was in a previous marriage and I got divorced,\\u201d Kolfage said. \\u201cI was in another relationship because my divorce dragged on for a couple years, so when I got divorced I was remarried a couple months later. This was in 2011\\u2013my divorce was finalized in 2011 and I got remarried in 2011.\\u201dOn Sept. 12, 2013, Kolfage received a letter in the mail from the VA indicating that the agency conducted a random investigation into his background and found out that he was divorced in early 2011. \\u201cPima County Superior Court online records indicate that you divorced [his ex-wife] on January [date in 2011],\\u201d the letter, which Kolfage provided to Breitbart News, reads. \\u201cWe propose to remove [his ex-wife\\u2019s name] as a dependent effective February 1, 2011, the first of the month following the date of your divorce. We propose to reduce your benefits from February 1, 2011 as follows.\\u201dThe VA then included a chart that laid out how the agency planned to charge him about $4,800 over the course of the next several years to make up for the discrepancy. The letter mentions nothing about how Kolfage was remarried just a couple months later, so it appeared to be a mistake. Kolfage then worked with a representative from the VA in Phoenix to solve the discrepancy.\\u00a0\\u201cSo, someone randomly did a background check on me and found out I was divorced,\\u201d Kolfage told Breitbart News. \\u201cAnd I guess they compared it and they thought I was getting overpaid for X amount of years \\u2014 early 2011 until now. So that\\u2019s where that came up. I sent them all the stuff back and was like, \\u2018No I was married again soon after that,\\u2019 and I sent them my marriage certificate. And I said that \\u2018if you guys did a background check on me you would have saw that I was married as well.'\\u201d\\u00a0\\u201cMy local VA in Phoenix, the guy I was responding to there was real helpful,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI sent my stuff in and a couple days later they sent my stuff back, and then he said, \\u2018You need this and that and that,\\u2019 and so I sent it in.\\u201dAfter dealing with that local representative, Kolfage said he received another letter from the VA admitting they made a mistake and that it was all straightened out now. \\u201cAt the end of all that, everything was finalized,\\u201d Kolfage said. \\u201cI received a letter saying it was good to go. I tried to find the letter but I can\\u2019t find it. But basically it said everything was quashed and that I wouldn\\u2019t have to pay any money and that it was taken care of.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u201cThe one where they said it was over, I read it and was like \\u2018cool.\\u2019 And I chucked it,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cI looked forever and I\\u2019m kind of pissed [that I can\\u2019t find it]. But I have every other letter.\\u201dLater, on Oct. 29, 2013, Kolfage received a third letter from the VA. This letter indicated he still owed the more than $4,800 to the VA\\u2013and that the discrepancy had not, in fact, been fixed. Kolfage has tried calling the VA again to deal with the issue to no avail; the 1-800 number, he says, \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t allow you to talk to anybody.\\u201d\\u201cIt just tells you they\\u2019re really busy and to call back another day and hangs up on you,\\u201d Kolfage said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I\\u2019ve been dealing with and I\\u2019m just kind of sick of it.\\u201dPhone calls and voice mails from Breitbart News into the VA\\u2019s national press office regarding Kolfage\\u2019s case have not been returned days later.Kolfage said that while he is close with his congressman Rep. Ron Barber (D-AZ)\\u2013he had served as a volunteer to help now former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ), whom Barber replaced after she she was wounded\\u2013he is tired of big government problems and decided to speak up publicly about the matter.\\u201cI really don\\u2019t know but the VA is so mismanaged there\\u2019s no telling whether it might be just someone clearly slacking on their job,\\u201d Kolfage said. \\u201cBut I really don\\u2019t know of any other veteran that uses their military rank and picture and speaks freely on stuff like me. So, I\\u2019m sure they\\u2019re aware of me and I\\u2019m sure someone is like \\u2018Who is this guy talking?\\u2019 But I really don\\u2019t know.\\u201dAbout Obama, Kolfage told Breitbart News that he is \\u201cnot a fan at all.\\u201d\\u201cI mean, I think that he\\u2019s like the worst president in a long, long time and he\\u2019s destroying our country with his policies and just his whole administration\\u2019s contempt for the American people,\\u201d Kolfage said. \\u201cNo one in his administration is held accountable for anything and it is just a failure to lead. He\\u2019s never led our country. He\\u2019s never rallied the House or the Senate to come together and unite on any issues. He just doesn\\u2019t want to. He divides the country. He divides our population.\\u201dAs for Obamacare, Kolfage said he thinks \\u201cit\\u2019s horrible.\\u201d\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not efficient and the government can\\u2019t handle veterans and there\\u2019s what, 300 million citizens of the United States? How are they going to handle 300 million citizens in one system that can\\u2019t handle a handful of veterans?\\u201d he wondered. \\u201cEverything\\u2019s a bureaucratic hassle with red tape.\\u201dKolfage added that while the VA \\u201cknows I\\u2019m missing my limbs,\\u201d if he needs \\u201capproval\\u201d for treatment on any other medical issues, he must \\u201cgo in and schedule this big appointment and meet with all these doctors and say, \\u2018Hey I want this.'\\u201d\\u201cI can\\u2019t call them \\u2014 I have to go in and face this like huge committee,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEverything is such a hassle. Now, I have a lot of connections with the VA so a lot of stuff is easier for me. I just think about all the people who don\\u2019t have these connections and I basically think they\\u2019re getting screwed over. That\\u2019s why I really want to \\u2014 with anything that happens to me at the VA \\u2014 I want to just push it out so people know what\\u2019s really going on.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 119054}"
