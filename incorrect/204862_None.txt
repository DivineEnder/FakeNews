Iran has been very helpful to them in this regard,\\u201d he said.Regarding Iran, Brun said that so far, the Iranians were keeping to the agreements they had made.\\u00a0 But, he warned, make no mistake \\u2013 Iran is doggedly preparing for a \\u201cgreat war\\u201d against Israel.Brun added that Iran was also working hard to make its mark on Syria, where 80% of the forces fighting the Syrian government forces of Bashar al-Assad had an Islamist agenda. Many of the victories in the revolution, however, have been achieved by secular groups.\\u00a0 It is those secular militias\\u00a0which are\\u00a0currently in control of areas of Syria bordering Israel. \\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 204862, \"title\": \"170,000 Missiles Currently Aimed at Israel\"}"
