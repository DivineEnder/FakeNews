"{\"title\": \"Northwestern University Historian Claims Christianity Poses Bigger Threat Than Islamic Terrorism\", \"content\": \"Catherine M. Wallace, who is a faculty member at Northwestern\\u2019s School of Medicine and a Christian herself, argues that fundamentalist access to United States\\u00a0armaments is the number one threat to the nation\\u2019s security.Wallace argues that because radical Christians are in positions of power and control the nuclear codes, they pose a greater danger to American society than do Islamic terrorists.\\u201cIf [anything Islamic] wanted to attack an American city, they had to hijack an airliner. If they want to blow up a concert, they need to put bombs on their own children and send young men in to kill themselves\\u2026 that kind of radicalism [Christian fundamentalism] in control of nuclear codes was a much, much greater threat,\\u201d Wallace claimed.According to\\u00a0The Chicago Maroon, the student newspaper of the University of Chicago, Wallace believes that a literal reading of the Bible is responsible for the threats posed by Christian fundamentalists.In Wallace\\u2019s view, this radicalism stems from a literal reading of the Bible. \\u201cNobody in the ancient world would have read the Bible literally,\\u201d Wallace said. The idea of a literal reading is a thoroughly modern phenomenon,\\u00a0according to Wallace\\u2014church fathers of the past would discourage anyone from taking the Bible literally.Therefore, according to Wallace, the fundamentalists have it all wrong. \\u201cChristian fundamentalism is a malignant form of Christianity,\\u201d Wallace said. In her opinion, their literalist reading creates misconceptions of what the Bible means, fostering a climate of hate and leading to increased and unnecessary conflict between Christians and the rest of the world. \\u2026When asked a final question on how she thought Jesus would respond to the modern political climate, Wallace answered on a positive note. \\u201cJesus was first a Jewish prophet reciting the Jewish rant in its standard edition, which is social justice, socio-economic justice. Care for widows and orphans, which is to say the unemployable. People who can\\u2019t earn their own living. And the just sharing of the world\\u2019s resources.\\u201dWallace concluded the conversation on the dangers of Christian fundamentalism by arguing that a modern Jesus Christ would be a socialist and advocate for \\u201cthe just sharing of the world\\u2019s resources.\\u201dTom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
