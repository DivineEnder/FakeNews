Al Sharpton and others to march across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on August 23 rests with the M.T.A., which operates the span.\\u201cWe\\u2019ll wait to see if, in fact, the entity that owns the bridge decides to allow it,\\u201d Bratton said during a meeting with reporters at City Hall.Told the M.T.A. had said the decision was the NYPD's, Bratton said that's not true.\\\"They own the bridge,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe initial authority would have to come from them\\u2014at least that\\u2019s my understanding [because] the liability is on them. If there were to be an injury, etcetera, that\\u2019s a cost that would be borne by the state or the authority.\\u201dThe planned march across the bridge from Brooklyn to Staten Island coincides with the 25th anniversary of the murder of Yusef Hawkins, who was killed by a group of white youths in Bensonhurst. It is also meant to highlight the problem of police brutality in the wake of the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner, who died in police custody last month.Critics have said the march will paralyze Staten Island.Bratton also said he has seen no signs of a work slowdown from police officers, despite comments from a union leader, Ed Mullins, who has said officers should call a supervisor to the scene whenever making an arrest in order to protect themselves against complaints of police brutality.Mullins' comments came in the aftermath of Garner's death. Video shot by a bystander of Garner\\u2019s interaction with police officers shows an officer putting an arm around Garner\\u2019s neck before he was wrestled to the ground. The city medical examiner later ruled Garner's death a homicide caused by a chokehold, a maneuver banned by the NYPD.\\u201cEd\\u2019s comments were just that, comments,\\u201d Bratton said. \\u201cWe are not experiencing any repercussions from that comment or that statement. New York cops are out there today doing what they were doing yesterday and the day before, and that\\u2019s protecting the people of New York.\\u201dThen, Bratton added, \\u201cEffectively, what he is advocating is something we would support: be safe, do it safely and do it as expeditiously as possible.\\u201dA free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York education policy and politics.A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York energy policy and politics.A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York health care policy and politics.A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York health care policy and politics.A morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on state news and politics.A morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on city news and politics.A weekly round-up of legislation in City Council for politics and policy professionals.A reported briefing on money in politics, executive moves, and trends in communications, lobbying and consulting.A twice-a-week digest of news on courts and the law in New YorkAzi Paybarah and Jimmy Vielkind's must-read briefing informing the daily conversation among knowledgeable New Yorkers.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
