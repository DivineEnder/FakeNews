"{\"title\": \"Skeptical Climatologist Calls Out 'Global Warming Nazis'\", \"content\": \"Dr Roy Spencer, Principal Scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, writes on his blog:\\u201cYeah, somebody pushed my button.\\u201cWhen politicians and scientists started calling people like me \\u201cdeniers\\u201d, they crossed the line. They are still doing it.\\u201cThey indirectly equate (1) the skeptics\\u2019 view that global warming is not necessarily all manmade nor a serious problem, with (2) the denial that the Nazi\\u2019s extermination of millions of Jews ever happened.\\u201cToo many of us for too long have ignored the repulsive, extremist nature of the comparison. It\\u2019s time to push back.\\u201cI\\u2019m now going to start calling these people \\u201cglobal warming Nazis\\u201d.\\u201dBold move, Dr Spencer. But I foresee problems ahead: not because anything you are saying here is technically inaccurate but because the climate debate is all about double standards.Here are some of the things you are not allowed to mention if you are a climate skeptic.1. Hitler\\u2019s Germany was the most eco-friendly regime in modern political history. As well as banning smoking on public transport and creating some of Europe\\u2019s first nature reserves, the Nazis were heavily into wholefood and clean living. Himmler wanted to feed the SS on organic food only. Goering threatened to send people who were cruel to animals to concentration camps. (For further details, see Watermelons)\\u00a02. There is no such thing as a climate change \\u201cdenier\\u201d. No one denies that climate changes. All that skeptics dispute is the degree to which man contributes to this largely natural \\u2013 and unscary \\u2013 process.\\u00a03.\\u00a0 The environmental lobby uses the same tactics used by totalitarian movements through the ages \\u2013 fascists, Nazis, communists, there\\u2019s really no difference. These include: brainwashing the young and turning them against their parents (\\u201cDad! You didn\\u2019t recycle!\\u201d); outrageous and dishonest propaganda (for Triumph of the Will see An Inconvenient Truth); vicious personal attacks; judicial bullying (see the forthcoming Mark Steyn trial).The reason you can\\u2019t mention this stuff is a) Godwin\\u2019s Law and b) \\u2013 just like the plotters who tried to kill Hitler or the ones in Stalin\\u2019s show trials \\u2013 you\\u2019ve already been found guilty and deserve no defense.However, if you\\u2019re a climate alarmist none of these strictures apply. You can call climate skeptics \\u2013 even high-end scientists like Dr Roy Spencer \\u2013 anything you like because, hey, having reservations about a flimsy hypothesis like Anthropogenic Global Warming theory is at least as bad as denying that Hitler murdered six million Jews.
