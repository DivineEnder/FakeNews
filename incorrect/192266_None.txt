"{\"title\": \"Roger Ebert Trashes Big Hollywood Readers\", \"content\": \"What is it with Roger Ebert and trashing everyday Americans? After spending a few days childishly attacking the truck drivers, waitresses, school teachers and mechanics who make up the Tea Party movement as \\u201cteabaggers,\\u201d he now uses his Twitter Olympus to go after the Big Hollywood community with this:\\n\\nEbert links to this post of mine from yesterday.This is the inter-web-nets and individual comments  get through all the time that are inappropriate. But Ebert\\u2019s not pointing to one specific comment. He\\u2019s talking about everyone. All of you. The rabble who dare object to being smeared with an obscene sexual slur  from one of your betters.Dear Mr. Ebert,I\\u2019ve had to delete some pretty nasty comments in my day, but do you know what I have yet to  come across over 14 months and thousands of comments? Someone getting off on smearing women, children, Army veterans and just plain old folks who want to have their say  with disgusting pornographic terms \\u2014 like a sick phone call from a heavy breather in the middle of the night.Never seen it. Not once.And do you know what kind of people I will never seek validation from? Those who think it\\u2019s funny to effectively call  everyday Americans  \\u201cc***suckers.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 192266}"
