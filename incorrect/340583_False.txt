In April, our colleagues Alicia Parlapiano and Larry Buchanan chronicled how United States campaignshave become two-year marathons. For Canadians, that might seem like the equivalent of traveling from British Columbia to Nova Scotia on one\\u2019s knees.\\\",\\\"Readerswere quickto comment onthis difference, and perhaps the most surprising part is that 11 weeks is much longer than the typical five-week Canadian campaign.\\\",\\\"Mike TTG, Toronto:\\\",\\\"At 11 weeks, the Canadian campaign is twice as long as normal, and needlessly so.\\\",\\\"Abhay, Busan:\\\",\\\"It\\u2019s actually one of the longest campaigns in the history of Canada. A lot of people are quite upset that it\\u2019s even as long as it is.\\\",\\\"Tom, Midwest:\\\",\\\"Agree. The Republican \\u201cdebate\\u201d was not a debate, and I turned over to watch the Canadian debate almost immediately to actually watch a debate. The further difference was the lack of audience on C-Span, rather than the Roman circus of the Cleveland audience who exemplified the coarseness and game-show attitude of Americans and put our worst foot forward. It is therefore instructive and interesting to watch the Canadian parliament in action compared to the House and Senate in the U.S., a complete role reversal. Try it sometime.\\\",\\\"Alan Burnham, Newport, Maine:\\\",\\\"The Canadian campaign is only 11 weeks in total! That says it all! Why must Americans suffer the gross indignity of endless ads, debates and requests for money? All that money should be helping those in need, not pummeling all of us with political garbage.\\\",\\\"NRroad, Northport, N.Y.:\\\",\\\"These differences are the least of differences between the two political and governmental systems. The U.S. political process is completely unhinged with extremists on left and right dominating the process, and a kind of hostile narcissism the general tone. In the near future, Canada\\u2019s biggest problem may be illegal immigration from the U.S.\\\",\\\"Allison Barber, British Columbia:\\\",\\\"Even though there are huge rifts in our political bents, just as in the U.S., we (so far) haven\\u2019t turned it into an absurd circus (yet).\\\",\\\"James, Canada:\\\",\\\"Actually, this election will be the longest since R.B. Bennett\\u2019s time and is a cynical attempt by the ruling Conservatives to basically bankrupt the other parties. This will be the only debate between the four as the prime minister has stated he will not attend any other potentially damaging debates and the N.D.P. opposition has said they won\\u2019t turn up unless he does. Political and public civility in Canada has been sadly eroded for the last decade.\\\",\\\"jtckeg, USA:\\\",\\\"The photo shows 4 candidates; not sure if there are more that aren\\u2019t in the photo, but a point that must be made:\\\",\\\"The two-party standard \\u2014 and the labels that inevitably become affixed to each party \\u2014 are out of date with today\\u2019s polarized voters, especially the ideological splits within parties that amplify differences between \\u201cparty before country\\u201d voters.\\\",\\\"Perhaps Bernie will break away from the mold and make it a horse race.\\\",\\\"Raymond, BKLYN:\\\",\\\"11 weeks \\u2026 lucky Canadians. But think of the billions in ad revenue U.S. broadcasters would lose if we were blessed with an 11-week campaign season. Who would not then weep for billionaires like Murdoch &amp; his ilk, suffering so \\u2026\\\",\\\"This article was initially published as a letter to subscribers of The Upshot\\u2019s newsletter.
