"{\"title\": \"Trump to Supporters: Stop Watching Megyn Kelly\", \"content\": \"Apparently, the feud between Donald Trump and Fox News has now morphed into one where Trump can say whatever he wants and Fox News will still allow him to come on the network to pitch his case to voters. Case in point: Sunday afternoon, Trump told his supporters to stop watching Megyn Kelly\\u2019s primetime show. Nevertheless, the Republican frontrunner still appeared as a much-publicized guest (by phone) on Fox and Friends the next morning:\\u2014Best thing my supporters can do if you don\\u2019t like the way @megynkelly and her puppets unfairly treat \\u201cus\\u201d is don\\u2019t watch her show!\\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2015\\u2014The feud between Trump and Kelly began in August during the Fox News Republican presidential debate.\\u00a0Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 290461}"
