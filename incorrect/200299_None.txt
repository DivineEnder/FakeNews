"{\"content\": \"U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen \\u2013 appointed by President George W. Bush \\u2013 summoned Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and four other immigration enforcement officials to come to Brownsville, Texas and appear in court in August to explain why they shouldn\\u2019t be held in contempt of court for violating his court order.The order requires the five immigration officials to appear at a hearing August 19th, but the hearing may never actually occur. Hanen said he would cancel it if he was \\u201csatisfied\\u201d with the government\\u2019s actions to correct work permits it issued to illegal immigrants violating the injunction Hanen had earlier ordered, according to Politico.\\u201cThis Court has expressed its willingness to believe that these actions were accidental and not done purposefully to violate this Court\\u2019s order. Nevertheless, it is shocked and surprised at the cavalier attitude the Government has taken with regard to its \\u2018efforts\\u2019 to rectify this situation,\\u201d Hanen stated. The judge wrote in his order:The Government has conceded that it has directly violated this Court\\u2019s Order in [the government\\u2019s] May 7, 2015 advisory, yet, as of today, two months have passed since the Advisory and it has not remediated its own violative behavior. That is unacceptable and, as far as the Government\\u2019s attorneys are concerned, completely unprofessional,\\u00a0Neither side should interpret this Court\\u2019s personal preference to not sanction lawyers or parties as an indication that it will merely acquiesce to a party\\u2019s unlawful conduct.\\u201cSpokespeople for the Homeland Security Department and the White House had no comment Tuesday on the order, which applies to Johnson as well as Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Leon Rodriguez, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldana, Border Patrol Deputy Chief Ronald Vitiello. and Customs and Border Patrol Director Gil Kerlikowske.Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron confirmed Wednesday that the agency is aware of Hanen\\u2019s order, Politico reported.\\u201cDHS has received the District Court order and is currently reviewing it with the Department of Justice,\\u201d she stated. A Justice Department spokesman did not give any comment to Politico.Hanen and the 26 states who have sued to stop Obama\\u2019s executive action on immigration accuse the administration of being dishonest and misleading the court about the number of illegal immigrants who were awarded work permits last November.\\u201cThe judge said he was under the impression none of Obama\\u2019s changes to the deferred action program had been implemented when legal arguments played out on the issue earlier this year. Justice Department lawyers have said there was no intent to mislead but that they regret any confusion,\\u201d Politico\\u2019 Josh Gerstein reported.Following the clarification, DHS said the Inspector General is investigating why roughly 2,000 work permits were issued in violation of Hanen\\u2019s court injunction.This Friday a federal court will hear oral arguments as to whether or not Hanen\\u2019s injunction should be upheld.\", \"article_id\": 200299, \"title\": \"Federal Judge Orders Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to Appear in Brownsville, Texas Court in Violation of Executive Order Injunction\", \"source_id\": 2}"
