"{\"title\": \"Blue State Blues: Barack Obama, Africa's Worst U.S. President\", \"content\": \"Now, however, he is being greeted by Kenya, and by Africa in general, with a heavy dose of skepticism. With time running out on his two terms, it is clear that Obama has been a disappointing U.S. president\\u2013for Africa, too.Even the Politico\\u2013normally an Obama-friendly outlet\\u2013has noted\\u00a0the mood, in an article by Edward-Isaac Dovere. \\u201cDespite family ties to Kenya, Barack Obama has arguably done less for the continent than his predecessors,\\u201d the sub-headline\\u00a0reports. And in spite of\\u00a0boasts by Obama adviser\\u00a0Susan Rice (whose own record on Africa is abysmal), \\u201con\\u00a0the streets and among African leaders, there\\u2019s deep frustration,\\u201d Dovere writes. Obama is perceived to have ignored Africa\\u00a0(as well as his Kenyan family, reportedly\\u00a0neglected by their American cousin).African judgments of American presidents should always be taken with a grain of salt. The continent still loves Bill Clinton, whose record on Africa is mixed at best. He signed the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which provided African exports preferential\\u00a0access to American markets. That helped spur economic growth in many places.Still, Clinton was responsible\\u2013and has apologized\\u2013for failing to intervene in the Rwandan genocide, partly on Rice\\u2019s advice. He also failed to anticipate or stop the spread of al Qaeda\\u2019s terror network in East Africa.The\\u00a0consensus among policy experts is that George W. Bush was Africa\\u2019s best president. He embraced a generation of new African leaders and supported\\u00a0their\\u00a0efforts to achieve what South Africa\\u2019s then-president, Thabo Mbeki, called the \\u201cAfrican Renaissance.\\u201d He helped broker an end to civil war in the Sudan, and later spoke out against genocide in Darfur. Crucially, he led efforts to introduce Aids drugs to Africa\\u2013over the objections of\\u00a0Mbeki, who allowed hundreds of thousands to die while he claimed, bizarrely, that Aids was\\u00a0not a viral disease at all.Yet Bush\\u2019s contributions have largely been forgotten, thanks to the fact that Africa\\u2019s political and media elites are inescapably trapped in leftist propaganda\\u2013a vestige of the Cold War, whose ideas still form the basis of civic education in much of the region. Bush is remembered as having invaded Iraq, against the will of elite Third World opinion.(True, many ordinary Zimbabweans hoped Bush would topple their own dictator, Robert Mugabe. But it was not to be: Zimbabwe has tobacco, not oil\\u2013and Bush trusted Mbeki to fix\\u00a0Mugabe, a\\u00a0serious error.)Africa loved Obama, and had high hopes in his ascent, seeing him as something of an adopted son, if not quite a native one. Yet Obama has never really taken an interest in Africa\\u2019s priorities.While China has been spreading investment, trade, and influence far and wide across the continent, Obama has pulled America back on the world stage, Africa included.His one major intervention was the war in Libya, where his failure to follow up with a serious rebuilding effort allowed\\u00a0the spread of terror across North Africa and the Sahel, including Boko Haram.Obama has shown little love for the great causes of democracy and human rights, in Africa as elsewhere. Almost exactly a year ago, Obama hosted some of Africa\\u2019s worst dictators at the White House during his U.S.-Africa Summit. They posed proudly for pictures with Obama, no doubt projecting those images back home as proof that their regimes had America\\u2019s stamp of approval.In Egypt, prior to the Arab Spring, Obama cut funds for\\u00a0promoting democracy; later, he embraced the Muslim Brotherhood rather than Egypt\\u2019s struggling liberal democrats.The only cause that Obama has taken\\u2013somewhat\\u2013on the road in Africa is gay rights, which has triggered outrage in Kenya and elsewhere, as it conflicts sharply with Africa\\u2019s conservative social mores.The\\u00a0U.S. media are focusing on Obama\\u2019s first trip \\u201chome\\u201d as president, which will no doubt produce some nostalgic and even touching moments. The story of the Obama family is tinged with both sadness and greatness.Yet as far as Africa\\u00a0is concerned, Obama has \\u201clost\\u201d it\\u00a0to the Chinese, missing\\u00a0a unique opportunity. The next president will do better\\u2013by default.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 173223}"
