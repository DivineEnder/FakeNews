"{\"title\": \"Full 'Dictator' Trailer: Islamists Mocked?\", \"content\": \"\\u2014\\u2013I was very hard on Sacha Baron Cohen for his elitist mocking of everyday Americans in \\u201cBorat\\u201d and found \\u201cBruno\\u201d entirely too sleazy to ever watch again.\\u00a0That doesn\\u2019t mean I don\\u2019t recognize the man\\u2019s talent, because I do.\\u201cThe Dictator\\u201d looks promising, not only for its\\u00a0seeming lack of sleaze, but\\u00a0because the comedian seems willing to mock Muslims, something\\u00a0our\\u00a0\\u201cedgy\\u201d entertainment class has thus far \\u2014 with some notable\\u00a0exceptions \\u2014 cowered from. \\u00a0The trailer seems to ask: Will the American people help soften\\u00a0an Islamist dictator? Oh, and if you think watching the title character get slapped around by someone on our side bothers me in the least \\u2026 first day reading Big Hollywood?\\u00a0 Besides, it looks as though that\\u2019s the action that forces the character to join and learn from our society. So it should be interesting to see how the film itself presents the moment and our national security personnel. Muslim or not, men who treat women with disrespect deserve an onscreen\\u00a0beating. In real life, I of course would only attempt to dialogue with them in the hopes of encouraging a decision to join a sensitivity training course. \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 251480}"
