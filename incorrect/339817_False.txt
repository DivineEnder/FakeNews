"{\"article_id\": 339817, \"title\": \"The Art of Doing Time: Prisoner, Painter, Escapee  \", \"content\": \"{\\\"The news that Richard W. Matt, the convicted murderer whowas killed by the policeon Friday after a weekslong manhunt, spent most of his time behind bars painting technically skilled portraits of Julia Roberts, President Obama and fellow inmates\\u2019 relatives, and bartering them for preferential treatment, has come as a surprise to many.\\\",\\\"But to those who have spent years teaching art in prisons or making it themselves as inmates, such a trade is a deeply ingrained ritual of incarcerated life. It is practiced informally or as part of established programs by a wide range of prisoners, many of them, like Mr. Matt, with profoundly violent pasts and little art experience.\\\",\\\"Those who knew Mr. Matt at the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y., say he painted to keep himself occupied and to obtain favors from guards and fellow prisoners. Such favors were \\u201ca pat on the back for doing portraits of loved ones of inmates,\\u201d said John Mulligan, who served two and a half years in the Clinton prison with Mr. Matt and after his release had Mr. Matt send him paintings and drawings. Mr. Mulligan added that painting \\u201cwas a way for him not to be preoccupied with his thoughts all the time \\u2014 it was an escape.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Matt\\u2019s paintings tended toward what experts on prison art described as a popular genre that gets scant attention outside cellblock walls: photo-based portraits of celebrities, political figures and fellow inmates\\u2019 loved ones.\\\",\\\"His work appealed toat least one guardat the Clinton prison, in upstate New York, from which Mr. Mattescaped with another inmate, David Sweat, in early June. (Mr. Sweat was said to bein custodyon Sunday.) Gene Palmer, who has worked at the prison since 1987, told investigators that he smuggled in a screwdriver and pliers and did other favors for Mr. Matt in exchange for a dozen paintings and other works by him, according to court documents and a person with knowledge of the situation. Mr. Palmer also told investigators that he helped Mr. Matt mail one of the paintings, of the television character Tony Soprano, to a woman in Florida, who sold it on eBay for $2,000.\\\",\\\"Policies about whether inmates may mail art out or receive money for their work vary widely and change often at prisons across the country.\\\",\\\"Mr. Mulligan, who described Mr. Matt as his \\u201cbest friend\\u201d at Clinton, said that while he had not paid for Mr. Matt\\u2019s artwork, he had sent money and food after his release. Mr. Matt, he said, had taught himself to paint, probably while serving time many years earlier in Mexico. At Clinton, Mr. Matt was considered by far the most talented artist.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe was the best in the system that anyone could recall,\\u201d Mr. Mulligan said. But he added that his efforts to get some recognition for Mr. Matt\\u2019s paintings in the outside world had gone nowhere. \\u201cThe art community is tough,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Art by particularly notorious convicts \\u2014 Charles Manson, John Wayne Gacy \\u2014 has always found an avid, sometimes macabre, collector base. The market for inmate art typically ranges from small galleries and exhibitions to eBay and other collectibles websites, includingmurderauction.comandmurderabilia.net.\\\",\\\"The Prisons Foundation, established by former prisoners 12 years ago in Washington, says it receives about two works a week from prisoners or their families to sell. Prices for works range from $20 to more than $1,000. The foundation plans to hold an exhibition of prisoners\\u2019 art on Governors Island in New York, opening on July 21, with about 80 items for sale.\\\",\\\"Phyllis Kornfeld, who has taught art classes in prisons for more than 30 years, said that while some prison artists have shown great talent and their work has found its way to galleries and collectors, the vast majority of inmates making art have limited access to materials and instruction and simply paint, draw and sculpt to pass the time and as a form of expression.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very rarely about profit making,\\u201d said Ms. Kornfeld, author of \\u201cCellblock Visions: Prison Art in America,\\u201d published by Princeton University Press in 1997. She has organized an exhibition, \\u201cFolk Arts and Artifacts From America\\u2019s Prison Culture,\\u201d that opens on Thursday at the Forbes Library in Northampton, Mass. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just one of the expressions of humanity that is pushing itself out, as it always does,\\u201d she added.\\\",\\\"Anthony Papa, who was serving 15 years to life in the Sing Sing prison in Ossining, N.Y., when a fellow inmate taught him how to paint, said that art was \\u201ca very powerful rehabilitating tool, not only for the prisoner but for the institution.\\u201d Mr. Papa, an advocate for drug-policy reform, has gone on to have some success as a painter since his release, selling works, usually with themes of social justice, in the low four figures.\\\",\\\"For a while during his incarceration, he said, inmates could exhibit their work in an annual show, \\u201cCorrections on Canvas,\\u201d in the Legislative Office Building in Albany. But that program was ended by a New York state corrections commissioner whobanned sales of inmates\\u2019 artin 2002, saying it had come to be seen as the state providing a forum for inmates to profit. The previous year, protests had arisen when that show featured work by Arthur Shawcross, a serial killer whose sketches of figures like Princess Diana and Santa Claus sometimes sold for several hundred dollars.\\\",\\\"In many maximum-security prisons across the country that do encourage or allow art to be made, the range of permitted art materials is narrow, because of fears that things like paintbrushes or chemical-based paint could be used as weapons or for other illicit purposes. (Brushes, for example, can be broken down for their metal parts.)\\\",\\\"\\u201cNothing that was flammable,\\u201d Mr. Papa said, ticking off the list. \\u201cI used mostly acrylic paint and watercolors. I bartered with guards for materials. If I was painting their portrait, they would bring in oil.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Rachel Marie-Crane Williams, an associate professor at the University of Iowa who has taught art in prisons for several years, said that inmates made do with what they could get. In some cases, she said, they soaked M&amp;M candies in water to use the coating for coloring, and made brushes out of dampened toilet paper.\\\",\\\"\\u201cPrison toilet paper is wonderful for sculpture,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt holds together.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Martin F. Horn, a former New York City corrections commissioner who now teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said arts programs could benefit prison authorities as much as prisoners. Prisoners who violate rules can be deprived of programs, while prisoners who are cooperative can enjoy them.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou want prisoners to have some modicum, some array of privileges that you can use to reward good behavior and punish bad behavior,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Mr. Matt, who had beenserving a sentence of 25 years to life at Clinton since 2008, appears to have used tubes of paint that he kept hidden, perhaps because they were of a type that was considered contraband. But Mr. Mulligan, in prison for bank robbery, said that Mr. Matt painted openly in his cell and was widely known by guards and prisoners as an active artist who always worked from photographs.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf the photograph wasn\\u2019t really perfect, he couldn\\u2019t do it,\\u201d Mr. Mulligan said. \\u201cHe was always really specific about how he wanted the pictures. He was working on one of me and my fianc\\u00e9e and her cat, based on a photo portrait of us that I sent him. But that was the last I heard from him.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He added that he had no qualms about collecting work by a convicted killer. \\u201cPeople who think there\\u2019s a moral problem with that are ignorant,\\u201d he said, adding, \\u201cThey don\\u2019t understand the prison situation.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He said that he had fielded a couple of offers for Mr. Matt\\u2019s works since the escape and that he expected more to come. \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping I can sell some,\\u201d Mr. Mulligan said. \\u201cI hope he gets some recognition out of this. I\\u2019m not going to lie to you about that. If I was able to sell some of them, I\\u2019d send some of the money to his daughter. That\\u2019s what he wanted to do.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Andrew Edlin, whose company owns and runs theOutsider Art Fair, said he had no real basis to determine whether Mr. Matt\\u2019s work would be more valuable because of his notoriety or death. If it happened, he said, it would have little to do with collectors admiring the quality of the art, which is not particularly distinguished.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTheir reasons would be purely mercenary,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think, to me, this is sort of a pop-oddity culture story rather than an art world story.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
