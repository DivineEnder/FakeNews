Against the backdrop of rising anti-Semitism in Hungary, France and here in the UK (as demonstrated by the European Jewish Congress poll just last week) this is once again a battle that goes beyond Britain\\u2019s borders. A battle that we cannot win by retreating from the EU and having a conversation with ourselves.\\u201dBut her comments have caused outrage from the Editor of the Jewish Chronicle, Stephen Pollard. He said: \\u201cI\\u2019m not often shocked. But this post by @britinfluence links euroscepticism and antisemitism. Jaw dropping.\\u201dI\\u2019m not often shocked.

She said: \\u201cThe EU is not just about fostering economic prosperity; it is there to prevent us re-living the mistakes of our past. It is about crafting a positive vision that appreciates and embraces a strong, diverse and outward-looking Britain for tomorrow.\\u201dFor decades the European Union has claimed to be the reason for peace on the continent, a claim rejected by Eurosceptics. Brussels has also begun referring to\\u00a0World War\\u2019s One and Two as the First and Second European Civil Wars. This is despite them not falling into the definition of civil wars because they were not internal battles within one country.Franklin herself is the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor who fled Germany seventy-nine years ago.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 184238}"
