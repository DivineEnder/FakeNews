"{\"title\": \"Gun-Free Zones: Mass Shootings Waiting to Happen\", \"content\": \"In truth, the common link between these four attacks was not the firearm used but the fact that the victims were compulsorily disarmed and therefore unable to defend themselves.Via such gun-free zones, military commanders, lawmakers, and independent school districts create an environment that invites criminals to ply their wicked trade.This is just one more reason why Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) was so wrong when she reacted to the September 16 Navy Yard shooting by asking, \\u201cWhen will enough be enough?\\u201d Her intimation was that there has been enough bloodshed and it is finally time for more gun control.However, it is not time for more gun control. Rather, it is time for school districts, military commanders, and lawmakers like Feinstein to cease forcing law-abiding citizens to remain unarmed like sitting ducks.\\u00a0We live in America and we have the 2nd Amendment. We should be practicing how to use guns to defend our lives and the lives of our loved ones rather than practicing how to flee, \\u201cshelter in place,\\u201d or hide in fear until the police can find and protect us.\\u00a0Perhaps author Brad Thor put it best when he tweeted: \\u201cGun free zones are open invitations to lunatics, which guarantee zero resistance & unlimited victims until police arrive.\\u201dWhen will enough be enough with gun-free zones? When will Feinstein and others realize such zones are just mass shootings waiting to happen?Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 210240}"
