"{\"title\": \"Governor Cuomo\\u2019s Legislative Agenda Faces New and Familiar Obstacles\", \"content\": \"{\\\"ALBANY \\u2014  When Gov.Andrew M. Cuomounveiled his vision for his second term on New Year\\u2019s Day in an inaugural speech from the heights of1 World Trade Center, his ambitions were as lofty as the view, an expansive agenda touching on poverty, income inequality, ethics and criminal justice reform.\\\",\\\"But with less than a month remaining on the legislative calendar and Mr. Cuomo faced with two untested newcomers at the negotiating table, the focus in Albany is on a range of more prosaic, time-sensitive issues which nonetheless could affect millions of New Yorkers.\\\",\\\"Some long-sought initiatives already appear to be doomed, including tuition assistance for immigrants and even broader ethics changes, despite pleas from reformers andpublic outrageat a series of corruption scandals, including criminal charges againstSheldon Silver, the former Assembly speaker, a Democrat from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and his Senate counterpart,Dean G. Skelos, the former majority leader, a Republican from Long Island.\\\",\\\"Their successors \\u2014 SpeakerCarl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat, and the majority leaderJohn J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican \\u2014 are entering into their final weeks of negotiations with Mr. Cuomo on a raft of knotty and sometimes intertwined issues, including rent control, property taxes,charter schoolsand mayoral control of New York City schools.\\\",\\\"For his part, Mr. Cuomo \\u2014 a savvy political tactician whose longtime companion,Sandra Lee,recently had breast cancer surgery \\u2014 is also seeking new policies on sexual assaults on college campuses, killings involving police officers, and the minimum wage, which he has already shown a willingness to act on unilaterally.\\\",\\\"But veterans of Albany\\u2019s legislative alchemy are not optimistic that many of the tougher issues will be addressed, particularly with two new leaders still earning the confidence of their colleagues.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf they are not considered \\u2018must-dos,\\u2019\\u201d said Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, \\u201cthen they probably will become \\u2018won\\u2019t dos.\\u2019\\u201d\\\",\\\"Indeed, with lawmakers still adapting to the new leaders, there is a sense that bills may need near unanimous support inside party conferences to pass this session.\\\",\\\"June 17 is the lawmakers\\u2019 last scheduled day in Albany, and two major areas of contention are housing and education, including extensions to rent laws \\u2014 restricting rent increases for about one million New York City apartments \\u2014 and the program known as 421-a, which offers tax breaks to developers to encourage construction in the city. Both expire on June 15, and negotiations could run right up until that deadline.\\\",\\\"MayorBill de Blasiois expected to travel to Albany on Wednesday. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said he is looking forward \\u201cto speaking with each and every one of the leaders,\\u201d including Mr. Flanagan. Issues the mayor will push include rent regulations and mayoral control of the city\\u2019s schools, which lapses next month.\\\",\\\"The issue has caused friction between Mr. Cuomo \\u2014 who believes a three-year extension is appropriate \\u2014 and Mr. de Blasio, who has lobbied for permanent control. But last week Mr. de Blasio said he was satisfied with a bill passed by the Assembly that granted a three-year extension without alteration.\\\",\\\"But Mr. Flanagan, who led the Senate\\u2019s education committee before taking over as majority leader, has suggested he wanted changes in mayoral control, and would like the city to pay a bigger share of costs to improve underperforming schools.\\\",\\\"Mr. de Blasio is also deeply invested in the negotiations over 421-a, which he would like to see revamped to require developers to set aside more of their buildings for working-class residents in exchange for city tax breaks. But Mr. Flanagan has been guarded in his comments on the issue. And some Albany observers believe that some simple extensions \\u2014 rather than modifications of current laws \\u2014 are more likely.\\\",\\\"Mr. Cuomo has shown a willingness to work closely with Republicans and in recent weeks has signaled a pressing interest in providing tax credits to families whose children attend private and religious schools. Mr. Flanagan supports a similar proposal which has already been approved by the Senate. Both Mr. Cuomo and Republicans would also like to increase the number ofcharter schools, but the Assembly \\u2014 whose Democrats are strongly backed by public school teachers\\u2019 unions \\u2014 have been cool to such proposals.\\\",\\\"Last week, both Democrats and Republicans used so-called \\u201cone house\\u201d bills, with little to no chance of passing a Legislature divided by party to stake out their priorities. The Assembly, controlled by Democrats, passed a four-year extension of rent regulations. Hours later, the Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the Senate, announced the passage of legislation to make permanent the state cap on local property taxes.\\\",\\\"The cap, enacted in 2011, Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s first year in office, does not technically expire until next year, but \\u2014 in an only-in-Albany twist \\u2014 is linked to the extension of the rent laws.\\\",\\\"As is often the case in the closing weeks of the session, hundreds of bills on scores of issues are likely to be considered, a dizzying array includingmixed martial artsanddining rights for dogs.\\\",\\\"Mr. Horner said the onslaught of legislation, and the comparative inexperience of Mr. Heastie and Mr. Flanagan, could make the job of lobbyists easier and that of good-government groups like his harder.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s really whack-a-mole season when it comes to bad bills,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Some of Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s inaugural themes are echoed in pending proposals, albeit in less grand terms. The governor\\u2019s plan to require private colleges to enact a so-called affirmative consent or \\u201cyes means yes\\u201d policy regarding sexual behavior seems to have some backing, despite some hesitation from legislators and educators about how the bill is worded. (Public colleges already use that standard.)\\\",\\\"The issue of criminal justice reform is also still percolating. In hisState of the Stateaddress in January, Mr. Cuomo outlined a seven-point plan to improve relations between the public and law enforcement after thedeathof Eric Garner, an unarmed man black man who died after a police officer on Staten Island put him in a chokehold, and the killings oftwo New York City police officers.\\\",\\\"That plan seemed to gain new attention in mid-May when the governor wrote a letter to the Legislature \\u2014 postedonlinein The Huffington Post \\u2014 calling on it to take up his reforms. But someadvocatesseeking changes said that they would rather the Legislature not act on one of the governor\\u2019s proposals: an independent monitor empowered to review killings involving the police and instead name a special prosecutor.\\\",\\\"Mr. Cuomo has shown a willingness to act unilaterally on the minimum wage, which he has proposed be raised to $11.50 an hour in New York City and $10.50 an hour in the rest of the state. But Republicans do not agree with proposals on the wage, which will increase automatically to $9 an hour by 2016.\\\",\\\"So this month, Mr. Cuomo instructed the state\\u2019s labor commissioner to impanel a wage board to examine whether workers in the fast-food industry were earning enough. The board held itsfirst administrative meetinglast week and is expected to return its recommendations this summer.\\\",\\\"But other bills may have already been scuttled, such as theDream Act, which would allow some undocumented college students to access state financial aid. The bill has repeatedly passed the Assembly but, inan interviewlast week, Mr. Flanagan said it would not in the Senate.\\\",\\\"\\u201cLet me make it clear: We are not doing the Dream Act,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"The Legislature and Mr. Cuomo agreed to some new ethics laws as part of the state budget deal in March, though they were criticized for not going far enough. A plan to strip pensions from corrupt public officials stalled in the Assembly but may have been revived last week with a new,more tightly worded proposal.\\\",\\\"Still, Gerald Benjamin, professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz, said the circumstances of both Mr. Heastie\\u2019s and Mr. Flanagan\\u2019s rise to power \\u2014 in \\u201can unpleasant political context,\\u201d rather than campaigns of big ideas \\u2014 may mean both men want to minimize risk in closing days.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou essentially want to get out of town without any major damage being done,\\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. \\u201cAnd a credible claim that you took care of business.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 339229}"
