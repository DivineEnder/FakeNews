"{\"title\": \"Daily Gut: Say 'No' to Condoms\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"So according to new research, having sex without a condom is healthy \\u2013 at least for your head. A leading Scottish psychologist claims that unprotected straight sex can dramatically boost men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s mental well-being \\u2013 with or without the kilt. He adds that wearing a condom can increase risk for depression and stress \\u2013 probably triggered by trying to open those little wrappers with fat stubby fingers.Now the research was immediately condemned by sex educators, who believe this finding can only lead to unprotected sex, pregnancy, STD\\u2019s and tedious play dates at McDonalds. The professor, however, stood strong and said: \\u201cEvolution is not politically correct\\u2026 there is actually only one [sexual behavior] that is consistently associated with better physical and mental health and that is the one\\u2026 favoured by evolution.\\u201dOf course he said this all with a delightful Scottish accent, which made it more endearing. But I get it: because unprotected sex boosts your chance of reproduction, and reproduction is the name of the evolutionary game \\u2013 then you, biologically, feel better about it. Which makes sense, I guess. But there\\u2019s more to it than that, I\\u2019d say.For one: perhaps you feel better not using the condom, because it feels better not using the condom! Of course that feeling of well-being dissipates shortly after you realize you didn\\u2019t wear a condom. Then that well-being is replaced by the three stages of fear: which is fear, more fear, and still more fear.But more importantly, the use of condoms might say more about your choice of partner \\u2013 who influences your happiness more than the sex you\\u2019re having. The fact is, if you\\u2019re not using a condom, there\\u2019s a higher chance the person you\\u2019re having sex with is someone you trust \\u2013 like your wife. Although the researcher disagrees with that point \\u2013 my feeling is if you\\u2019re using condoms, chances are you\\u2019re more likely to be sleeping with some random chick at the office, an unstable drifter named Roy that you met at Port Authority, or in my case \\u2013 a lemur. That can\\u2019t be good for evolution, either.So in conclusion: say no to condoms, and yes to Scotland.Welcome back everyone (welcome back Greg!)Tonight: Eric Bolling, Shannon Bream, Tamara Holder\\u2026.and\\u2026.(drum roll)\\u2026Ian McCulloch from Echo and the Bunnymen!!!!!\", \"article_id\": 279002}"
