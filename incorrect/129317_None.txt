"{\"article_id\": 129317, \"title\": \"Turkey Enters Yemeni Fray with 'Humanitarian Aid' After Condemning Iranian Intervention\", \"content\": \"Hurriyet Daily News reports\\u00a0that a Foreign Ministry spokesperson confirmed that Turkey had already sent \\u201chumanitarian aid, mainly food, to Yemeni refugees in Djibouti over the past week.\\u201d Turkey fully plans on continuing shipments, including four tons of medicine, to the African nation, the statement concluded.The statement remained ambivalent politically, demanding only that \\u201clegitimate state authority\\u201d return to Yemen as soon as possible.The move is notable as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan initially harshly condemned Iranian intervention in Yemen, as Shiite Houthi rebels took over the capital, Sanaa, forcing President\\u00a0Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi to flee to the south of the nation. In March, following an announcement that a coalition of Arab nations led by Saudi Arabia would begin airstrikes in the country to defend Hadi and Sunni officials from the Houthi rebellion, Erdogan accused Iran of tipping the scales of the conflict towards the Houthis and \\u201cannoying us\\u201d with its\\u00a0intervention, implying that Turkey was considering adding military reinforcements to the Saudi coalition.Erdogan visited Tehran in April, however, and returned from the trip, apparently on friendly terms\\u00a0with the Iranian regime. Turkey did not send troops to fight the Houthis in Yemen and appeared poised for neutrality. Iran and Turkey continued to publicly claim they were cordial despite their disagreements, most prominently regarding Turkey\\u2019s opposition to and Iran\\u2019s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\\u00a0\\u201cIn many areas, we see Turkey as a partner, not a competitor. We have common denominators, we can work together,\\u201d\\u00a0Iranian Vice President Masoud Soltanifar said in an interview with\\u00a0Hurriyet\\u00a0in which he clarified that Erdogan \\u201cdid not speak of\\u201d Yemen upon visiting Tehran, making the situation much more comfortable for both parties.Most recently, Iranian Foreign Minister\\u00a0Javad Zarif and Turkish Foreign Minister\\u00a0Mevlut Cavusoglu met on Tuesday in Kuwait to discuss bilateral ties. In this visit, the topic of Yemen did surface, but only in the context of humanitarian aid, according to reports about\\u00a0the meeting, which occurred before the\\u00a042nd Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The Turkish diplomat, reports claim, emphasized the need for humanitarian aid in Yemen.The Houthi rebels suffered their first major setback since taking over Sanaa on Monday, being driven out of the southern city of Dalea by groups of Sunni militias believed to be loyal to President Hadi.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
