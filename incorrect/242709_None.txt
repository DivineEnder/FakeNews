"{\"title\": \"Kenya Arrests Four Girls and Their Parents for Female Genital Mutilation\", \"content\": \"The girls told the media they chose to undergo the procedure due to peer pressure. The Standard reports:\\u201cOur parents never forced us to undergo the rite. We escaped from our homes one week before we underwent the cut. We walked several kilometres to Dung\\u2019u Dung\\u2019u village, where we met the old woman, who performed the rite,\\u201d said one of the girls.The girls said they paid Sh200 [$1.94] each to the woman before she offered the services.\\u201cWe offered casual labour on one of the farms in our village where we earned the money to pay the old woman who circumcised us,\\u201d they said.The parents told the court they had nothing to do with their daughter\\u2019s female genital mutilation. However, the authorities \\u201cordered they be remanded until October 14 as police continued their investigation.\\u201d One girl claimed she did not know that FGM is illegal in Kenya.In July, MailOnline interviewed two cutters in Kenya. Anna-Moore Ndege is \\u201chalf-blind\\u201d but began performing female genital mutilation\\u00a070 years ago.\\u201cGirls are cut to ensure they remain faithful because the sexual organ is not there anymore,\\u201d she declared. \\u201cWhen you are cut you will not be a slut looking for men here and there like a prostitute. You are docile, waiting for your husband because after you are cut, sex is for having children not for anything else.\\u201dParents around the world, but mainly in Europe, bring their daughters back to Africa to be butchered.\\u201cCircumcision is an important festival,\\u201d stated cutter Agnes Kerubo. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a celebration like Christmas. It unites people. There is feasting and drinking and dancing.\\u201dShe continued: \\u201cWhen you are cut that\\u2019s when you can grow healthily into a woman because the bad blood is not there anymore. In the body there is good blood and bad blood. After a girl is cut the bad blood is gone.\\u201dPolice swarmed Scottish airports to protect females during the peak of \\u201ccutting season.\\u201d Female genital mutilation is illegal in Scotland, but it does not stop families from transporting their unsuspecting daughters to other countries. These family members \\u201cchoose the summer holidays to give girls time to \\u2018heal\\u2019 before they return to school.\\u201dIn August, the Somalian government announced \\u201cits intentions to ban\\u201d female genital mutilation in the country. UNICEF discovered that 98 percent of the girls in Somalia underwent the mutilation.\\u201cIn the past when girls were subjected to FGM, it used to be something the society was proud of, but it\\u2019s no longer the same,\\u201d said Sahra Mohammed Ali Samatar, minister for women\\u2019s affairs. \\u201cPeople shy from being associated with FGM. Now, when parents want their daughters to undergo FGM, they opt for underground avenues rather than public. That\\u2019s a clear indicator that the number of cases has drastically reduced.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 242709}"
