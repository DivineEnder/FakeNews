"{\"title\": \"GOP Presidential Candidates Need Better Responses to Iran Deal\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"For one thing, it lacks credibility. If the U.S. backs out of the deal, Iran will do the same, citing passages in the text of the agreement that allow it to do so. Iran\\u00a0will then\\u00a0race towards a nuclear weapon, boosted by the many freebies the deal\\u00a0will already have given\\u00a0them, such as assistance with research at the underground Fordow facility. A pledge by a presidential candidate to tear up the Iran deal is effectively a pledge to trigger a nuclear crisis that will lead to war. That is a result of the shoddy way in which the deal is written, but it is also the truth.The other problem with a pledge to tear up the deal after it takes effect is that repeated reversals in U.S. foreign policy damage our credibility as global leaders. It was bad enough that Obama abandoned Iraq after a hard-won victory, and that he failed to enforce his own \\u201cred lines\\u201d against Syria\\u2019s use of chemical weapons. It will compound the damage if Obama\\u2019s successor pulls another reversal, sending the message that U.S.\\u00a0foreign policy is subject to the vagaries of domestic politics. Obama has set a terrible example; that is no reason to make it a precedent.A more effective and credible response\\u00a0for an aspiring Republican candidate would\\u00a0be to declare that if the deal passes, as bad as it is, he or she\\u00a0reserves the right to act immediately and unilaterally to punish\\u00a0any Iranian violation, no matter how minor, through military action if necessary. If Obama believes that the deal is as good as he says it is, he will have little grounds to object. It will also\\u00a0give Democrats reason to consider\\u2013now\\u2013whether the deal\\u2019s provisions really are as strong as advertised, or whether they might trigger a dangerous confrontation.Meanwhile, Republican candidates should work hard to help defeat the deal in Congress\\u2013the last chance to stop Obama\\u2019s appeasement. They should also articulate a fallback option if the deal fails to pass, such as: maintaining\\u00a0U.S.\\u00a0sanctions (which are still\\u00a0powerful even in the absence of international cooperation); preserving the arms embargo and the ballistic missile restrictions; offering explicit\\u00a0assistance to U.S. allies in the region; and moving U.S. forces\\u00a0into position to\\u00a0renew the potency of the \\u201cmilitary option\\u201d that Obama\\u00a0still pretends to preserve.\", \"article_id\": 168891}"
