"{\"title\": \"Some on right doubt Clinton injury\", \"content\": \"The official story out of the State Department is that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton recently fainted and suffered a concussion and is working from home. As a result, she is not expected to testify before Congress this week on the subject of the attack in Benghazi.Message received, right?Not everyone is so convinced.The New York Post called it \\u201cone of the most transparent dodges in the history of diplomacy.\\u201dThe Daily Caller\\u2019s Jim Treacher won\\u2019t believe it until he sees some proof. \\u201cIf she has a concussion, let\\u2019s see the medical report. Let\\u2019s see some proof that she\\u2019s not just stonewalling. If it\\u2019s true, then we can all wish her a speedy recovery. But it\\u2019s ridiculous to expect us to take her word for it.\\u201dDitto Republican strategist Alice Stewart, who said on Fox News, \\u201cI certainly hope Hillary Clinton has a good note from her doctor.\\u201dAlso on Fox News, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton said: \\u201cYou know, every foreign service officer in every foreign ministry in the world knows the phrase I am about to use. When you don\\u2019t want to go to a meeting or conference, or an event, you have a \\u2018diplomatic illness.\\u2019 And this is a diplomatic illness to beat the band.\\u201d( Also on POLITICO: State Dept. slams Bolton for claiming Clinton faked illness)Lucianne.com\\u2019s Lucianne Goldberg tweeted, \\u201cHillary has given us a great new excuse. Don\\u2019t call in with a cold or a bad tooth. Just say you have a concussion. It can last for days.\\u201dOver at NewsBusters, P.J. Gladnick was peeved that more reporters didn\\u2019t express skepticism about what happened to Clinton.\\u201cNo ambulance was called and she was not hospitalized? Riiiight! Because when you\\u2019re Secretary of State you somehow don\\u2019t rate standard medical treatment.\\u201dThe conservative blog \\u201cExposing Liberal Lies\\u201d was also unconvinced. \\u201cHow very convenient that our former first lady took a tumble and now has a concussion \\u2014 just in time to miss the Benghazi hearing on Friday. She wouldn\\u2019t want to expose her incompetence to the American public, not when she has presidential aspirations, now would she?\\u201dRadio show host Tammy Bruce said, \\u201cIf only Nixon knew all he had to do was \\u2018fall down.\\u2019\\u201dRichard Grenell, a former national security spokesperson for Mitt Romney\\u2019s presidential campaign, filled his Twitter feed with skepticism.\\u201c[S]he\\u2019s avoiding it,\\u201d he wrote.State department spokesman Philippe Reines said Saturday that Clinton had fainted earlier in the week, but did not offer additional details.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 50637}"
