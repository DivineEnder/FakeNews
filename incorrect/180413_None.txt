Although one of the problems with using such a small caliber for self-defense is that it lacks raw stopping power. So an attacker may continue to attack even after being wounded by .22 round that was not well-placed.Two of the best .22 rifles on the market can currently be found at gun dealers and stores like Wal-Mart and Gander Mountain for approximately $200 to $320. These are the Marlin Model 60 and the Ruger 10/22.First, the Marlin Model 60.The Model 60 is a no-frills rifle. I think of it as the Jeep CJ of .22 rifles. It has a non-detachable tubular magazine that runs along the bottom of the barrel and holds 14 rounds.This particular rifle is known for two things: durability and accuracy. It is common to find a used one that\\u2019s a couple of decades old yet shoots like one you just took out of the box. Growing up in Kentucky, I had a Marlin Model 60 with a sling on it, and I\\u2019ll never forgot spending my summers in the woods shooting cans, other targets, and small game with the weapon.\\u00a0The Model 60 is so accurate that we used to sit cans or empty milk containers filled with water as far as 40 or 50 yards away and shoot them with open sights.\\u00a0This is not to say I hit them every time I pulled the trigger, but it is to say this is the kind of accuracy you can get from a weapon through which thousands of rounds can be shot for less than a hundred dollars.Next, the Ruger 10/22.The 10/22 shares three traits in common with the Model 60: durability, accuracy, and affordability in shooting. But if we leave these traits for a moment and look at the gun\\u2019s particulars, it\\u2019s a very different weapon.Whereas the Model 60 has a non-detachable tubular magazine, the Ruger 10/22 comes with a detachable 10 round magazine from the factory. And the popularity of the 10/22 is so great that innumerable aftermarket companies make larger magazines \\u2014 25 round, 30 round, 50 round, and beyond \\u2014 for the rifle as well.\\u00a0And whereas the Model 60 has a set look, the Ruger 10/22 is a gun many people buy with intentions to accessorize. \\u00a0From the factory the Ruger 10/22 is available in numerous stock and barrel combinations and in the aftermarket world, there are untold accessories available for the gun.Here\\u2019s the bottom line: In my opinion you simply can\\u2019t go wrong with either gun. And although the choice of one of these guns over the other is based largely on aesthetics, either gun is certain to deliver a degree of fun, accuracy, and durability that you may not have known before.\\u00a0\\n\", \"title\": \"Need a .22 Rifle?
