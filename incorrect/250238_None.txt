"{\"title\": \"Times Tip for Taliban: Don't Fire Til You See the Whites Of Our Eyes\", \"content\": \"It is a cause of great consternation to the pro-Muslim Democrats in the MSM and U.S. government that the marksmanship skills of our Taliban opponents have proved less than stellar of late. The New York Times\\u2018 blogger C. J. Chivers\\u2019 latest posting, \\u201cAt War: The Weakness of Taliban Marksmanship,\\u201d which goes into their shortcomings in great detail, along with expert analysis of steps these terrorists should take to become more effective in their attempts to kill our countrymen.\\n\\nEven for the troop-movement-plan-leaking Times, this is disturbing. Chivers starts with the premise that the Taliban soldiers and their AK-47 rifles have every reason to be more successful \\u2013 I mean, after all, these are the same Afghani riflemen that took down the mighty Soviet Army in Rambo III and, in reality, back in the 1980s. These Afghani terrorists are also descendants of the great Khyber rifleman who beat back the British with their hand-crafted long rifles. While these historic Afghans valued prowess with a rifle, it\\u2019s clear that the current Taliban forces have fallen prey to the same problem that plagues our American Ivy League college students:They don\\u2019t believe they have to work for success.They believe that simply because they are fighting the great Satan (ie., us) they will be victorious.  But as those of us out here who actually know something about firearms and marksmanship have long since learned, marksmanship is a perishable skill. Any fool can point a gun, pull the trigger repeatedly (or once with full auto \\u201cPray and Spray,\\u201d as my old instructor used to call it) and score an occasional hit, but consistently hitting a target requires frequent, concentrated practice.Chivers goes then outlines the individual facets of rifle accuracy, including breathing, sight picture, and proper support for offhand shooting. His advice? The Taliban shouldn\\u2019t rely so much on fully automatic fire. They have to slow down, control their breathing and aim at the U.S. Soldiers more carefully.With two cousins in the military, I must say this helpful analysis is entirely unwelcome. If the Taliban isn\\u2019t getting enough time on the practice range, I\\u2019m hoping it is because our troops and local Afghan regulars are making their life a living hell, keeping them too busy running and fighting to settle down for some serious practice.Since we know that the Taliban reads the New York Times for helpful hints in fighting this war, I fully expect the gauntlet to be picked up by our representatives in Washington. Perhaps one of them will propose a bill to send aid money and firearms instructors to the Taliban in the name of \\u201cfairness\\u201d and \\u201cleveling the playing field.\\u201dAlso cited is the lack of proper vision correction (i.e. glasses) for the terrorists. Perhaps the Pentagon can issue new rules of engagement that require U.S. troops to hold fire until they are closer to the Taliban forces, along the lines of \\u201cdon\\u2019t fire until you see the whites of their eyes.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is a long, well-executed piece, and in case its impact is lost, Chivers promises to follow it up, in the interests of fairness and balance, with a future report on the \\u201cwild\\u201d rifle fire of American troops. I can\\u2019t wait.Until then I, and the families of U.S. troops overseas, will be glad to see continued reports of shoddy rifle skills among our enemies.  And wish the Times weren\\u2019t quite so blatantly rooting for the other side.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 250238}"
