On Monday night, Obama orchestrated his 22nd fundraiser of 2014 and his 60th since he won the election in 2012. One Democratic strategist observed, \\u201cThere\\u2019s definitely some donor fatigue in a lukewarm environment\\u2026 They are tired of giving and giving and they know there\\u2019s not much more the president can do.\\u201dThe Hill reported that even if Democrats were able to hold on to the Senate, the likelihood of much change happening inside the Beltway before 2016 would be scant. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a sense of resignation that Republicans are just going to run out the clock on the president no matter what,\\u201d one Obama donor confessed. \\u201cI think a lot of people think, \\u2018What\\u2019s really the point?\\u2019 \\u201cAnother donor argued that Obama lacks the skills that President Clinton had when it comes to nurturing his donors. He explained that Clinton understands the give-and-take nature of the relationship. Contrarily, Obama \\u201chas been very restrictive on that kind of stuff,\\u201d the donor said. \\u201cTeam Obama just [doesn\\u2019t] get it\\u2026 In terms of energizing the donor base, they have not done that well.\\u201dNevertheless, on Thursday Obama plans to be in Chicago attending fundraisers No.23 and No.24 for 2014. Obama, to whom The Hill referred as \\u201cthe campaigner in chief,\\u201d needs your help, insists former senior advisor to the president David Axelrod. Axelrod believes that donors shouldn\\u2019t forsake the midterm election and only spotlight the 2016 presidential race. \\u201cWith the Senate seriously at risk and the Koch Brothers spending prodigiously, shouldn\\u2019t [Democratic] fundraisers be focused on \\u201914 and not \\u201916 races?\\u201d Axelrod queries.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
