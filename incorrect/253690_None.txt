Those who couldn\\u2019t were shot andkilled.This follows a similar incident that occurred on November 22, whenAl-Shabaab terrorists forced a bus carrying 60 passengers to stop.They asked the passengers to recite Koranic verses, and those who wereunable to do so were lined up and then killed.  28 people were killed,19 men and 9 women.Kenya\\u2019s president Uhuru Kenyatta has been facing growing criticismsever since al-Shabaab terrorists attacked the Westgate shopping mallin Nairobi last year, killing 67 people.  Facing a political crisis,Kenyatta on Tuesday announced a government shakeup, and replaced twoof his top security chiefs.Other Christians working in the same area are in dread for theirlives.

The pair werearrested ten days ago as they tried to enter Lebanon from Syria.  Thearrests were made in conjunction with American and Westernintelligence sources.  It\\u2019s believed that authorities waited ten daysto announce the capture in order to have time to interrogate the pairand get information that could be used for a surprise attack on ISISor al-Baghdadi himself.  For example, she might know whereal-Baghdadi is now, or what routes he uses to travel around.The name of the captured woman is Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi.  It\\u2019s unclearwhether she actually is one of al-Baghdadi\\u2019s three wives, or whethershe\\u2019s a former wife, or whether she\\u2019s really married to some otherjihadist unrelated to al-Baghdadi.  There are also questions aboutwhether the child who was captured was a boy or a girl.  And ifal-Dulaimi is al-Baghdadi\\u2019s wife, then why was she coming to Lebanon?Was it to escape from al-Baghdadi, for whatever reason?Whether al-Dulaimi knows enough to provide useful intelligence isunknown, but her greatest value may be as a bargaining chip to win therelease of 26 Lebanese security personnel previously kidnapped byISIS.
