She also admitted she never did anything about the abuse and never sought medical attention for the child.For his part, Reed admitted to being a stern disciplinarian, but excused away his habit of constantly calling the child \\u201cidiot\\u201d by insisting it was all just a joke.Authorities charged both adults with domestic battery, permitting abuse of a minor and endangering welfare of a minor.All the children were removed from the home with four of the six placed in the custody of their own, natural father.The four-year-old was treated at Cooper-Anthony Mercy Child Advocacy Center and then remanded to the custody of the Department of Family Services.The Hot Springs Sentinel-Record reported on Monday that Denen and Reed were being held on $500,000 bond and will next appear in Garland County District Court on August 23.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
