(An anti-bullying poster remained.)\\\",\\\"Only a handful of Democratic voters showed up to caucus here four years ago as President Obama sought re-election. This year, with a competitive race, the Seventh Precinct chairman, Chris Nelson, was expecting up to 100.\\\",\\\"Mr. Nelson, who builds vending machines at a nearby factory, was fresh off a trip to the dentist. No teeth were pulled. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to sit up there with a drooling kind of look,\\u201d Mr. Nelson, 53, said with a laugh.\\\",\\\"On the other side of the cafeteria, a separate caucus was gathering, and battle lines were drawn: Supporters ofHillary Clintonto one side, Sanders supporters to the other, and Martin O\\u2019Malley \\u2014 the candidate least likely to meet the so-called viability threshold of 15 percent of attendees \\u2014 in the middle, positionally up for grabs.\\\",\\\"5:40 P.M.As a precinct captain for the first time, Steve Rose memorized talking points from the Sanders campaign and studied a math sheet on viability counts (\\u201cpaid for by Bernie 2016 \\u2014 not the billionaires\\u201d), his sights set on converting O\\u2019Malley supporters who might find themselves in need of a new candidate.\\\",\\\"He arrived here with other enticements as well: Rice Krispies Treats, miniature cinnamon buns and sandwiches from the local Hy-Vee supermarket. \\u201cThis is Iowa, so I brought some food and water to appeal to the basic needs,\\u201d said Mr. Rose, an education professor at Simpson College in Indianola. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll be there for a couple hours.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Rose, whose wife, Mary Jones, was a precinct captain for Senator Barack Obama in 2008, ruefully recalled losing out on some supporters because a rival campaign had brought homemade sandwiches.\\\",\\\"7:02 P.M.The chairman, Mr. Nelson, raps his hand on a table and calls the caucus to order. \\u201cThe eyes of the nation are on us tonight,\\u201d he says. \\u201cAnd the world, too, I might add.\\u201d The count is announced: 137 eligible voters, meaning candidates will need 21 voters to remain viable.\\\",\\\"At least one voter remains undecided. Jennifer Eaton says she still has not made up her mind: \\u201cI\\u2019ll probably go with who I think can win against whoever the Republicans put up.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Eaton is far more familiar with the site of this caucus than most. She works as a lunch lady in the cafeteria. Looking at the crowded tables, it hits her. \\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to put them back in the right spot!\\u201d she said.\\\",\\\"7:21 P.M.There are 18 people in the O\\u2019Malley corner, under the viability threshold. Elsewhere, two undecided voters are being buttonholed by Betty Crawford, the Clinton precinct captain. Ms. Eaton, the lunch lady, is one of them. \\u201cThe email thing concerns me, the Benghazi thing concerns me,\\u201d she says. (\\u201cThe email thing has been all cleared up!\\u201d a member of the Clinton team says.)\\\",\\\"Margaret Vernon, 72, the caucus secretary and an O\\u2019Malley supporter, approached Ms. Eaton from the side. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why you may want to consider Martin O\\u2019Malley,\\u201d she says, smiling. \\u201cHe doesn\\u2019t have that baggage.\\u201d\\\",\\\"7:25 P.M.Nicholas Webb, 31, a lawyer who supports Mr. O\\u2019Malley, looks glum. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to make it,\\u201d he says. Several Clinton supporters have gathered to persuade the members to defect. Suddenly, Mr. Rose, the Sanders captain, is there, too: \\u201cBernie is a whole more in your camp than Hillary is.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Then, a reprieve. Mr. Nelson says that \\u201cto be fair,\\u201d he will allow 10 extra minutes for the O\\u2019Malley group to find the three extra votes they need to stay viable. Ms. Vernon makes a beeline back to Ms. Eaton, the uncommitted voter, and before long, cheers rise up: She has drifted over to the O\\u2019Malley corner, welcomed with warm pats on the back.\\\",\\\"7:35 P.M.Twenty-one! The O\\u2019Malley gang has collected the extra votes it needed. Their success, however, is as much about pragmatism as principle. \\u201cIf he\\u2019s viable, it takes one away from Bernie,\\u201d says Albert Brooks, an Uber driver who switched from Mrs. Clinton to Mr. O\\u2019Malley.\\\",\\\"7:54 P.M.Two separate counts of voters suggest a Clinton victory, but the vote totals are off. Some of those who voted, it turned out, had not registered.\\\",\\\"At last, the final count is at hand. Mrs. Clinton, with 63 votes, is 10 ahead of Mr. Sanders; she receives five delegates to his four, and Mr. O\\u2019Malley ekes out one. An exodus ensues as voters grab their jackets and head out, hoping to be home ahead of an impending snowstorm.\\\",\\\"8 P.M.The room is almost completely deserted \\u2014 democracy accomplished in an hour flat. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard not to win,\\u201d says Mr. Rose, the Sanders captain. \\u201cBut after Bernie leaves office in eight years, O\\u2019Malley will be a real good candidate.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
