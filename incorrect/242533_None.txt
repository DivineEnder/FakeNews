"{\"title\": \"Turkey Has Arrested 1,000 More Suspected PKK than ISIS Members Since Suru\\u00e7 Bombing\", \"content\": \"More than 1,300 people have been arrested for allegedly having ties to the Kurdistan Workers\\u2019 Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated terrorist group of Marxist ideology. In contrast, Turkish authorities report that they have arrested 276 people for having suspected ties to ISIS or Al Qaeda, rival jihadist groups.Turkish\\u00a0Justice Minister Kenan \\u0130pek released this numbers today, reports Turkish newspaper\\u00a0Hurriyet.\\u00a0\\u201cWith effective work having been carried out since July 22 after the Suru\\u00e7 massacre up to today, 1,308 people who are members of the PKK, the KCK [the Kurdish Communities Union, the PKK\\u2019s umbrella group], the YGH [the Patriotic Youth Movement] and the YDG-H [the Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Movement, the youth wing of the PKK] have been arrested,\\u201d he said.Turkey has made a total\\u00a0of 1,673 terrorism-related arrests since the bombing of Suru\\u00e7. The remaining suspects are believed to be affiliated with the\\u00a0DHKP-C, a radical Marxist terrorist organization responsible for the execution of a high-ranking prosecutor in April.The Suru\\u00e7 bombing targeted a group of young Kurdish leftists planning to travel to Kobani, a Kurdish town in Syria recently liberated of its ISIS presence, to help affected civilians. Despite targeting leftist Kurds, the Turkish government used the occasion to begin airstrikes in Syria and Iraq against the PKK as well as ISIS. Turkish officials said at the time they believed ISIS to be responsible.Turkish airstrikes in the region killed hundreds of PKK members\\u00a0in the weeks following the Suru\\u00e7 attack, including the head of the PKK\\u2019s women\\u2019s militia and 30 female soldiers. The attacks led the acting head of the PKK, Cemil Bayik, to accuse Turkey of supporting ISIS by bombing their sworn enemy.\\u00a0\\u201cErdogan is behind IS massacres. His aim is to stop the Kurdish advance against them, thus advancing his aim of Turkishness in Turkey,\\u201d Bayik then said.The Suru\\u00e7 bombing has now been largely overshadowed by twin suicide bombings in Ankara, the nation\\u2019s capital, targeting a peace rally by leftist Kurdish youth. Like the Suru\\u00e7 bombing, the Islamic State\\u00a0immediately rose to the top of the list of suspects, and the two men identified as the suicide bombers\\u2013\\u00a0Yunus Emre Alagoz and\\u00a0Omer Deniz Dundar\\u2013 both had ties to ISIS.Alagoz was identified as the brother of\\u00a0Seyh Abdurrahman Alagoz, the suicide bomber responsible for the Suru\\u00e7 attack. The brothers were well-known for running an \\u201cIslam Tea House\\u201d the functioned as an ISIS member HQ for local jihadis.Following these revelations, Turkey arrested two PKK affiliates.The two men arrested were allegedly tied to a Twitter account named @MrBereday, which allegedly predicted the Ankara attacks and warned media that the attack was a strictly ISIS, and not PKK, affair.Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in an interview following these arrests that he believed ISIS and PKK members met with representatives of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to plan the Ankara bombing. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan followed that statement with a declaration the same week that,\\u00a0\\u201cfor Turkey, there\\u2019s no difference between the PKK \\u2026 or Daesh,\\u201d using the Arabic acronym for ISIS.The PKK and ISIS are sworn enemies, as are ISIS and the Assad regime. Kurdish fighters in Syria have warned that toppling Assad would lead to \\u201cdisaster,\\u201d but they are not allies. While the PKK was once allied with Hafiz al-Assad, the current Syrian head of state\\u2019s father, Kurdish leaders in Syria have been working with the Free Syrian Army, who oppose Assad, in Syria, as a means to fight the Islamic State.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 242533}"
