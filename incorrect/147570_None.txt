"{\"title\": \"'High-Ranking' Texas Mexican Mafia Member Arrested--Faces Slew of Charges\", \"content\": \"Sergeant James Springer of the Seguin Police Department told Breitbart Texas that James Salazar III was arrested after officers responded to a call regarding shots fired on private property. Salazar attempted to flee the scene when police showed up in the\\u00a0700 block of Roberts Street\\u00a0around 6 a.m.\\u00a0Detectives subsequently obtained a search warrant for Salazar\\u2019s residence, where they reportedly discovered his wife, Kathy Salazar, along with over $10,000 in cash and 29 grams of methamphetamine. The press release stated that computers and other electronic devices were also seized in the home.\\u00a0The Seguin Police Department told Breitbart Texas that Salazar has been charged with burglary of a habitation with intent to commit a felony, unlawful possession of a firearm by a\\u00a0felon, resisting arrest, driving without a license, forgery of government money, manufacturing or delivering a controlled substance, deadly conduct for discharging a firearm and retaliation for threatening\\u00a0a police officer.\\u00a0Salazar remains in the\\u00a0Guadalupe\\u00a0County Jail\\u2013his bond is set at $500,000.\\u00a0Additional charges may be forthcoming.According to\\u00a0Guadalupe\\u00a0County\\u00a0police records, Salazar has an extensive criminal history. In 1992, he was charged with a felony for aggravated robbery.\\u00a0Sergeant Springer said many details about the arrest\\u2013such as how Salazar was identified as a gang member\\u2013cannot be disclosed at this time since the case is ongoing. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re dealing with someone like this, it\\u2019s usually an ever-expanding case,\\u201d Springer said. \\u201cWhen the case is related to gang activity, it can lead us to another case, which then can lead to another case. It is an ever-evolving scenario.\\u201dSergeant Springer noted that gang members are typically identified by tattoos. \\u201cTattoos tell gang members\\u2019 stories, what their job is, and which gang they belong to.\\u201dThe Texas Mexican Mafia is a relatively large prison gang that has a presence all throughout the Lone Star State, according to Springer. \\u201cMost people who join these gangs do it because it gives them something to belong to. Gangs will deal with anything that is illegal.\\u201d\\u00a0Sergeant Springer told Breitbart Texas that\\u00a0prisons are usually segregated within the population by gang titles, race and religion. Although gangs typically do not integrate with one another, it is not uncommon for them to buy drugs from each other, according to Springer.\\u00a0Such a claim of inter-organizational collusion echoes recent reporting from Breitbart Texas\\u2019 Managing Director Brandon Darby. In April 2013, Breitbart News reported on FBI revelations that criminal entities such as the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas and then-U.S. based Texas Mexican Mafia were cooperating for the purpose of drug trafficking and contract killings\\u2013despite conventionally held notions that the groups held racially-exclusive policies against each other. Based on available documentation, federal law enforcement continues to maintain that profit has taken precedence over racial differences between the criminal enterprises.Kathy Salazar was charged with manufacturing and delivering a controlled substance, according to the police press release. She was bonded out of jail for\\u00a0$25,000.Follow Kristin Tate on Twitter @KristinBTate\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 147570}"
