This is their Congress. It\\u2019s about them, not us.\\u201dEleven months into it, with single-digit approval ratings and a bitter year behind them, the record of Boehner and top House Republicans is mixed, at best. There have been some successes: cutting $1 trillion in spending and eliminating earmarks. But they have been unable to live up to the aspirations of the tea party movement that swept them into power in November 2010. They have not repealed \\u201cObamacare,\\u201d and the year has been characterized by nasty showdowns that made both sides look bad.And despite their best efforts, Republicans have not been able to convince the American public that they\\u2019re doing anything positive on jobs and the economy. New polls show as many as two-thirds of Americans want new representation in Congress, an all-time high.As the year lurches to a close, here\\u2019s POLITICO\\u2019s first-year report card for Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California, Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa of California.John Boehner: Boehner promised to be a different kind of speaker than his predecessors, one who would resist the ironfisted control of the House imposed by Nancy Pelosi, Dennis Hastert and Newt Gingrich. His most satisfying moment may have come in February, when he let House freshmen go crazy by voting on hundreds of amendments to a government funding bill. It was pure Boehner: \\u201cThis is diving off the 50-foot diving board your first dive.\\u201dBoehner was able to push through spending cuts of more than $1 trillion, a major achievement, including slashing funding for members\\u2019 own offices. He banned earmarks; he helped pass trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, as well as a patent reform bill, which were big wins for corporate America.Yet Boehner has, at times, looked like the hostage of his 87-member freshman class rather than its leader. Lacking earmarks or other weapons to keep them in line, Boehner is often left to prod, cajole and even yell at lawmakers. A \\u201cgrand bargain\\u201d with President Barack Obama over entitlement and tax reform eluded Boehner, and both men were largely sidelined in the final talks on a debt ceiling boost. The House-Senate supercommittee was a failure.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
