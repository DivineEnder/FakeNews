"{\"content\": \"{\\\"There is only one Donald J. Trump, and yet as he has continued his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, there has been a groundswell of would-be Donald Trumps \\u2014 who are imitating him for laughs.\\\",\\\"Comedic impressions of Mr. Trump are on the rise, in late-night television and on the Internet, on programs like NBC\\u2019s \\u201cTonight\\u201d show (whose host, Jimmy Fallon, has been known to put ona distinctive wig and an unplaceable five-boroughs accent) and \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d (where bothDarrell HammondandTaran Killamhave played him this season).\\\",\\\"This past week, Mr. Trump was impersonated by no less than Johnny Depp, the Academy Award-nominated actor and star of the \\u201cPirates of the Caribbean\\u201d franchise, inan online film for the Funny or Die websitethat becamean Internet sensation.\\\",\\\"Needless to say, the genuine article has taken note of his many copycats, and he has made it clear he believes that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNow it\\u2019s gotten out of control, right?\\u201d Mr. Trump asked rhetorically in a telephone interview on Friday. \\u201cNow it\\u2019s really gotten crazy.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He added that the proliferation of impressionists was \\u201ca great honor,\\u201d and a sign of the health of his presidential campaign.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf they didn\\u2019t do it \\u2014 if they didn\\u2019t have any interest \\u2014 I guess things wouldn\\u2019t be going so good,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cI\\u2019d have to call you and say: \\u2018What\\u2019s going on here? What\\u2019s wrong?\\u2019\\u00a0\\u201d\\\",\\\"Among the professional Donald-gangers who met with his approval was Mr. Fallon,who played Mr. Trump\\u2019s mirror reflectionin a \\u201cTonight\\u201d show sketch when Mr. Trump appeared on that program in September.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think he\\u2019s a terrific guy,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cI also think he does some great, great imitations.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Also earning a rating of \\u201cexcellent\\u201d from Mr. Trump was Mr. Hammond, the veteran \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d performer, who has played Mr. Trump on that sketch comedy showfor more than 15 years.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump said he had not yet watched Mr. Depp\\u2019s portrayal of him in the Funny or Die film. He added that between the two of them, \\u201cthere\\u2019s a difference, physically, I can say.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cBut I think he\\u2019s a great actor,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Told by a reporter that the Funny or Die video presented a particularly satirical \\u2014 some might say scathing \\u2014 depiction of his ascent in the 1980s, Mr. Trump replied, \\u201cWell, these days are even better than the \\u201980s, and the \\u201980s were pretty good.\\u201d\\\",\\\"If any particular parody should present him as cocky or arrogant, Mr. Trump said he did not mind.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI know the business,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI know the game. And I\\u2019m not offended.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Even so, Mr. Trump stopped short of offering any advice to comedians or actors who wanted to improve their mockery of him.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey have enough guidance,\\u201d he said with a chuckle. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve got, certainly, plenty of material, that\\u2019s for sure. Some are really good. And some are really, really awful.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As to which impressionists did not amuse him, Mr. Trump said it would be impolite to name names.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSome of them are good people, but they don\\u2019t have it even close,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey actually think they\\u2019re good. They actually tell me how great they are at it, and I say, \\u2018Give me a break.\\u2019\\u201d\\\",\\\"He paused and added, \\u201cI don\\u2019t say that to them, because I never like to insult people.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 344096, \"title\": \"Even in Impersonations, Donald Trump Likes What He Sees of Himself\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
