Hijrah was defined in the criminal complaint as religious migration to Muslim lands in order to seek freedom or sanctuary.Wolfe\\u2019s wife told the FBI undercover agent that as soon as they had the money, they intended to go.

He met with a second undercover agent in January and told him that he and his wife and children had their passport photos taken earlier that day. He said he had learned that al Qaeda in Syria was training brothers from other countries and then sending those fighters back from Syria to their home countries to conduct terror attacks.He met with, and spoke with, both undercover agents from January until his arrest in June of 2014, telling them of his plans and discussing the various terrorists groups that are in Syria in an effort to decide which one to join. They confirmed together that other groups fighting around the vicinity of Syria would be more accommodating than Jabhat al-Nusra that would never let him leave.Wolfe did not contest the charges and plead guilty in June 2014. He admitted that from late summer of 2013 to the early summer of 2014, he planned to travel to the Middle East to provide support to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). This is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham/Syria (ISIS).The defendant admitted that he applied for and obtained a U.S. passport, and took other steps to prepare to support ISIS.

He was attempting to fly to Toronto, Canada. From there he was planning to fly from Canada through Iceland and land in Denmark.He was planning to travel to Syria to meet up with ISIL and join them in their armed conflict.Wolfe has been in federal custody since his arrest at the Houston airport.The arrest came after efforts of various law enforcement agencies, including investigations by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, U.S. Army Intelligence, several Austin area law enforcement departments, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Office of the Texas Attorney General, and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
