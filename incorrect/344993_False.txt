"{\"title\": \"Humans of New York Founder Takes On Donald Trump\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Brandon Stanton, the nimble shutterbug behind the immensely popular photo blogHumans of New York,has worked hard to filter politics and moral judgments out of his posts, intent on maintaining objectivity as he captures his subjects in words and on film, letting them speak for themselves.\\\",\\\"That changed last week when Mr. Stanton, 32, shed his sedulously cultivated neutrality to take onDonald J. Trump, excoriating the Republican presidential candidate in a300-word Facebook post presented as an open letter to Mr. Trump.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019ve watched you retweet racist images,\\u201d the post read in part. \\u201cI\\u2019ve watched you retweet racist lies. I\\u2019ve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy. I\\u2019ve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to \\u2018pay the legal fees\\u2019 of those who commit violence on your behalf.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The reaction was explosive. Within eight hours the post was shared 712,000 times, eventually garnering more than 2.2 million \\u201clikes,\\u201d 1,131,389 shares and 69,000 comments, making it among the most-shared posts in the history of Facebook. In the process, it turned Mr. Stanton, already a best-selling author, into a web sensation.\\\",\\\"Shortly afterward, he was summoned by Katie Couric, Yahoo\\u2019s global anchor,to appear as a guest on her web talk show, an occasion he welcomed, telling his host, \\u201cI want people to think of this as a moral question, not a political question.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The clamor had by no means subsided when a boyish, tidily bearded Mr. Stanton arrived the other day at the Starbucks at Ninth Avenue and West 59th Street. Patrons strained for a closer look; one, who identified himself only as Ben, sprang from his chair to approach Mr. Stanton and invite him for coffee. (Mr. Stanton good-naturedly declined.)\\\",\\\"Safe then to say that for this apparently reluctant Internet star, life has taken an unforeseeable, and perhaps irreversible, turn.\\\",\\\"Mr. Stanton, who has 17 million followers on Facebook (Mr. Trump has 6.7 million) and two best-selling anthologies of his posts, had, for all that, chosen to largely remain an inconspicuous figure, a camera-toting Everyman, his face all but obscured by a hoodie and FDNY baseball cap.\\\",\\\"His decision to go public, embracing the role of moral gadfly and guardian of the public weal, came as something of a shock, even to himself.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI saw my decision as a trade-off between upsetting people and making a strong moral statement,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"The choice, Mr. Stanton said, did not come naturally. \\u201cI was nervous,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut eventually I closed my eyes and hit \\u2018post.\\u2019\\u201d\\\",\\\"It was the content, not the volume, of the subsequent responses that took him aback. \\u201cI thought a lot of the feedback was going to be \\u2018Stay out of politics,\\u2019\\u201d he said, leaning forward intently as the conversation picked up steam. In no way had he anticipated its impact or the avalanche of commentary that followed, much of it echoing or expanding upon his own sentiments. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article.)\\\",\\\"It was the sort of validation Mr. Stanton said he has never chased.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m not an activist,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut in keeping silent about a moral problem, I began to feel a lot of guilt.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Indeed, his post was strikingly at odds with his customary posture as all-but-invisible observer.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOn the blog I use very few words and no photos of myself,\\u201d said Mr. Stanton, who draws his income from book sales and speaking engagements, and says he has turned down millions of dollars in online advertising. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to rent out the influence of \\u2018Humans of New York\\u2019 to any third party.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Still, he\\u2019s not a complete stranger to the camera. Viewers may have caught his appearance on CNN last December as a passionate advocate for the refugees of Syria and Iraq, and one in particular, identified only as Aya. Mr. Stantonwept openly in discussing her plight with the host, Fareed Zakaria.\\\",\\\"At Starbucks, he projected a similar intensity, reddening from time to time, describing his work with a missionary zeal. He grasped this reporter\\u2019s arm repeatedly to hammer home a point, and from time to time clamped a hand over hers, lest she somehow misinterpret him.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think there was a power in speaking directly to Donald Trump, rather than writing a think piece about him, \\u201d Mr. Stanton said. \\u201cIt also gave people who I think feel very strongly about him a chance to speak directly to him.\\u201d\\\",\\\"His decision arrived by degrees. In the half-dozen years since he left his job as a financial trader in Chicago (not quite voluntarily, as he has made clear in past interviews) to take up his camera on the streets of Manhattan, Mr. Stanton has snapped and interviewed some 10,000 randomly selected strangers, posting their photos and capsule life narratives on his blog.\\\",\\\"He is welcomed at times but just as often rebuffed.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s impossible to do this job without a strong sense of humility,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what it takes to be able to intensely listen as if each person\\u2019s viewpoint was as valid as your own.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He interjected, with a kind of perverse pride, \\u201cI\\u2019m the only person with a New York Times best seller that gets treated in the street like a homeless person every single day.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The transition from faceless chronicler of ordinary lives has been, from his perspective, gradual and all but imperceptible.\\\",\\\"His political engagement became apparent to some when Mr. Stanton first visited the Middle East.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI find it fascinating when people state that they \\u2018try not to be political,\\u2019\\u201d wrote Mike Riverso, a Canadian, on Twitter. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always seen everything that Humans of New York does as a political act. Humanizing Syrian refuges at a time when they\\u2019re highly vilified is inherently political.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Stanton shrugged in acknowledgment. \\u201cWhen you write about people whose lives are infused by politics,\\u201d he said, \\u201cpolitics just naturally enters the work.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ininterviewing inmates of the Federal Correctional Institutionin Cumberland, Md., he strove to maintain his detachment. At the time, \\u201cI never brought up issues related to the criminal justice system,\\u201d Mr. Stanton said. \\u201cThey came up in conversation just the same.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He said he hoped eventually to return to his role as a somewhat inconspicuous outsider.\\\",\\\"\\u201cPolitics became my life for two days,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to get down from that as soon as possible, so I can focus on my day-to-day work.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He may or may not continue to monitor Mr. Trump.\\\",\\\"\\u201cLet\\u2019s see what happens,\\u201d Mr. Stanton said.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 344993}"
