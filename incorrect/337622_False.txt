Disappointingly, there were no North American players. The only representatives from that continent were the daily bulletin editors, Rich Colker of Wheaton, Md., and Barry Rigal of New York.\\\",\\\"The event began with a Swiss Teams comprising 12 rounds of 14 boards. The leading eight teams qualified for 32-board quarterfinals. These were followed by 32-board semifinals and a 64-board final.\\\",\\\"Jason Hackett, Brian Senior, Gunnar Hallberg and John Holland of England led the Swiss by almost one match, took their quarterfinal by 77 international match points, and won their semifinal by 73 imps, with their opponents conceding at halftime.\\\",\\\"In the final, that English team played against David Bakhshi and David Gold from England and Ricco van Prooijen and Louk Verhees from the Netherlands. They had qualified in last place, won their quarterfinal easily and sneaked past Russia/Netherlands in the semis.\\\",\\\"The easy cruise to the title for England hit a bump in the road. The final was close all the way, with the lead changing hands nine times. With one session to go, England was ahead by 2 imps. Five boards later, England/Netherlands led by 19 imps. Then England started a recovery. With five boards to be played, the margin was down to 6 imps. The diagramed deal was Board 60.\\\",\\\"In the given auction, Hallberg (East), a Swede who has lived in England for many years, opened with a weak two-bid; van Prooijen (South) made a takeout double; Holland (West), despite the unfavorable vulnerability, jumped to four spades; Verhees (North) bid four no-trump to announce at least two places to play; and South, presumably thinking his spade ace was worthless, settled for five clubs.\\\",\\\"After West led a spade, declarer ruffed in the dummy, cashed the club ace, played a club to his king, then showed the right play in hearts for three tricks. He led a heart to dummy\\u2019s king, returned a heart to his ace and played a heart toward dummy\\u2019s jack. A moment later, South discarded his diamond eight on the heart jack and claimed 12 tricks.\\\",\\\"At the other table, after Gold (East) opened two spades, Senior (South) overcalled two no-trump, the choice that would probably gain the majority vote from an expert bidding panel. Despite the warning bells ringing, Bakhshi (West) jumped to four spades. Now Hackett (North) made a card-showing double. And South, given the prevailing vulnerability, was happy to pass.\\\",\\\"The defense was perfect. South led the club deuce, low from an odd number. North won with his ace and shifted to a low heart. South won with his king and returned the suit, so North-South easily took one spade, three hearts, one diamond and one club for down three.\\\",\\\"Minus 420 and plus 800 gave England 9 imps on the board and the lead by 3 imps with four boards to be played.\\\",\\\"The match\\u2019s conclusion will be covered in Thursday\\u2019s column.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
