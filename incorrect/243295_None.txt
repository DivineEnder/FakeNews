All three groups mentioned by Dehqan have been officially designated as terrorist organizations by the United States and other Western countries.\\u201cWe have often declared publicly that we will not stop material or spiritual support for Hezbollah or any other resistance organizations that are fighting the U.S. and the Zionist regime,\\u201d stressed the Islamic Republic\\u2019s defense chief.On the heels of Dehqan\\u2019s comments, Iranian land force Commander Ahmadreza Pourdastan, proclaimed that despite the nuclear deal Iran struck with the U.S. and five other world powers, hostilities between the Islamic Republic and America will likely continue due to the strong relationship America maintains with Israel.\\u201cIt is true that we have had an agreement with the U.S. in the nuclear field, but U.S. enmity towards us is deeply rooted,\\u201d said Pourdastan in a speech addressing land force commanders in Tehran,\\u00a0The Jerusalem Post\\u00a0reported on Thursday, citing Iran\\u2019s state-run Far News agency.\\u201cThe occupying Zionist regime is the U.S. redline, and we have a problem with the child-killer Israeli regime,\\u201d he added.The Iranian commander accused the United States of sponsoring terrorist organizations in the Middle East, namely the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).His comments come after Brig.
