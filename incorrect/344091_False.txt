"{\"title\": \"Glenwood Management, Developer Cited in Corruption Cases, Settles Disability Lawsuit\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Glenwood Management, a politically influential developer of luxury high-rise apartment buildings inManhattanthat figured in two recent public corruption trials, has agreed to settle a civil rights lawsuit that claimed three of its residential complexes violated the Fair Housing Act\\u2019s requirements for people with disabilities.\\\",\\\"The settlement was detailed in a consent decree approved on Thursday by Judge J. Paul Oetken of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who will retain jurisdiction to enforce the deal\\u2019s terms for three years, according to the document.\\\",\\\"Glenwood agreed to make alterations at the three complexes in Manhattan, and to inspect six others and, if necessary, retrofit those as well, according to the deal the developer struck with the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.\\\",\\\"Glenwood also agreed to pay up to $900,000 in compensation to people who suffered as a result of what the decree described as the firm\\u2019s \\u201cdiscriminatory housing practices.\\u201d The developer also is to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.\\\",\\\"One of the buildings is Liberty Plaza, a 287-unit complex at 10 Liberty Street in the Financial District that Glenwood says was the first high-rise rental building constructed in Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. It was designed and constructed with many inaccessible features, Mr. Bharara\\u2019s office said, like a lack of space in bathrooms and kitchens for people in wheelchairs, and bathroom configurations that prevented the installation of \\u201cgrab bars.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In the consent decree, Glenwood agreed that \\u201cwithout admitting liability,\\u201d it would address the alleged housing act violations. In a written statement on Friday, it said it would work to \\u201cenhance the accessibility\\u201d of the nine buildings cited in the agreement.\\\",\\\"Mr. Bharara, whose civil rights unit handled the case, said on Friday that the Glenwood lawsuit was the 10th filed by his office to \\u201censure that the promise of the Fair Housing Act \\u2014 that newly built residential buildings are accessible to people with disabilities \\u2014 is being fulfilled in New York City.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In some cases, developers have contested the suits in court. Glenwood, however, said in its statement that the agreement was the result of \\u201cextensive cooperation\\u201d with the government since 2008. The lawsuit was filed just over a week ago.\\\",\\\"In the recent corruption trials, Mr. Bharara\\u2019s office obtained the convictions of State Senator Dean G. Skelos, the Republican majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who served as the State Assembly speaker, who both then forfeited their seats.\\\",\\\"Prosecutors had alleged that Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver engaged in corrupt schemes that financially benefited them (or Mr. Skelos\\u2019s son, Adam) in exchange for official actions that helped Glenwood, one of the state\\u2019s most prolific political contributors. (No Glenwood official was charged, although the government told the judge in the Skelos case that the firm\\u2019s owner, Leonard Litwin, had been named as a co-conspirator.)\\\",\\\"Asked on Thursday whether the settlement\\u2019s timing had anything to do with the recent trials, a Glenwood spokeswoman said it was not related. She said the firm had been cooperative.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe agreement underscores Glenwood\\u2019s commitment to designing and building housing in which all New Yorkers can feel at home,\\u201d the developer said in its written statement.\\\",\\\"The Glenwood buildings in which the firm will do retrofitting also include Hawthorne Park, at 160 West 62nd Street, and the Sage, at 329 West 38th Street.\\\"}\"}"
