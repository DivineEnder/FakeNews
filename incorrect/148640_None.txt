"{\"title\": \"Obama & Brown Guilty of Shielding Alleged Illegal Alien Cop Killer\", \"content\": \"Monroy-Bracamonte had been deported twice before using a false identity. \\u00a0Authorities had plenty of\\u00a0opportunities to remove Monroy-Bracamonte long before\\u00a0he decided to wake up one October morning in 2014 and allegedly murder a cop with a so-called \\u201cassault weapon.\\u201dMonroy-Bracamonte\\u00a0apparently showed no regard for human life, and should face the death penalty for destroying so many families.\\u00a0\\u00a0But what do we do with the politicians who were his accomplices before the fact in\\u00a0this terrible crime?Under Jerry Brown and a supermajority of illegal alien enablers, whose welcome-mat policies have encouraged more illegals come to California than any other state, should be held responsible. President Obama has been no better: by executive order, he has effectively\\u00a0nullified all\\u00a0enforcement of immigration laws in the United States.You can see the names of those who voted for the Trust\\u00a0Act (AB4), to protect illegal alien criminals from detection, if their crimes are deemed\\u00a0minor\\u00a0(just like this alleged killer).Monroy-Bracamonte\\u2019s alleged crimes would have been deemed\\u00a0minor\\u00a0under this law, and he would have been\\u00a0\\u201clegally\\u201d permitted\\u00a0to remain here, had his arrests been in California instead of other states.\\u00a0 That means this policy endorsed by Gov. Jerry Brown, Attorney General Kamala Harris, and even some police chiefs, are complicit in protecting this dangerous man from being deported before he allegedly committed this unconscionable double-murder.\\u00a0It is ironic that\\u00a0California Democrats and a handful of Republicans just passed a law (AB1014) to allow the government to break down your door and\\u00a0confiscate your guns without a day in court if a \\u201cfamily member\\u201d deems you a threat to yourself or others, but they will not allow law enforcement to cooperate with ICE to remove illegal\\u00a0aliens who pose a threat to public safety.\\u00a0It is strange that the so-called journalists who rant and rail in favor of gun control and unchecked illegal immigration have\\u00a0remained silent on how an illegal alien\\u2013yes, he\\u2019s not \\u201cundocumented,\\u201d his documents were false\\u2013could navigate our society for over a decade, get a drivers license, work, and buy a gun in spite of the byzantine myriad of\\u00a0gun control\\u00a0restrictions now in place to prevent it. \\u00a0He must have bought it\\u2013yes, you guessed it\\u2013illegally.\\u00a0\\u00a0A report from the AP says that the alleged killer \\u201ctold Sacramento County Sheriff\\u2019s investigators that he was 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City. However, his fingerprints match the biometric records of a Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte in a federal database, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said.\\u201dFurther down at\\u00a0the end of the article, the AP makes note that this illegal alien, whatever his name is, had racked up no less than 10 tickets and multiple misdemeanor offenses between 2003 and 2009 as \\u201cMarcelo Marquez.\\u201d Prior to that, Kice tells us that\\u00a0Monroy-Bracamonte was first removed from the country in 1997 after being convicted in Arizona for possession of narcotics for sale. Then Monroy-Bracamonte was arrested and repatriated to Mexico a second time in 2001.ICE investigators were able to figure this out less than 24 hours after his arrest because they ran his fingerprints through the ICE database, something that is forbidden in California by the Trust Act for all but the most violent criminals. \\u00a0This raises serious questions. \\u00a0How did he get a drivers license? \\u00a0How is it that his fake ID was not detected over a decade, even though he\\u2019d had over a dozen encounters with law enforcement, either at traffic stops or as misdemeanors?After the passage of\\u00a0AB60\\u00a0in California, illegal aliens may now obtain a California drivers license as long as they can produce a consular ID known as a Matricula Consular, which the FBI has said is one of the most insecure\\u00a0documents in existence. Once you have your California drivers license, you can build an identity, just like\\u00a0Monroy-Bracamonte did with a Utah Drivers\\u00a0license. \\u00a0I am tired of reading stories about how we have to \\u201clook the other way\\u201d so that illegal aliens can have a better life in\\u00a0violation of our laws. I\\u2019ve watched\\u00a0too many good people become victims at the hands of\\u00a0people here illegallywho were given the benefit of the doubt one time too many. \\u00a0One thing is certain: we cannot grant amnesty to 11, 12, 20, 30 or 40 million illegal aliens, especially\\u00a0when the government has no idea who they really are, and no feasible way to sort through whatever number is correct.\\u00a0It\\u2019s time we stand up to our\\u00a0government\\u00a0and demand that it enforce our immigration laws, and recognize our right to carry as we choose so we may defend our own lives, put at risk by the policies of these Marxist-progressive-illegal-alien apologists who have made states like California a sanctuary for illegal alien criminals.\\u00a0Image: AP\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 148640}"
