"{\"title\": \"When Dog Owners Are Off the Leash\", \"content\": \"{\\\"I don\\u2019t identify with celebrities, especially ones with superstar husbands. But when Amber Heard, the actress, got caught last spring, I felt her pain. She has been ordered to appear in court next year,the BBC recently reported, for smuggling two Yorkshire terriers into Australia.\\\",\\\"Ms. Heard, the wife of Johnny Depp (who was in Australia to film another \\u201cPirates of the Caribbean\\u201d movie), neglected to declare the couple\\u2019s two dogs upon arrival by private jet at Brisbane. Unlike actors and tourists, dogs traveling from the United States must spend 10 days in quarantine.\\\",\\\"The incident gained attention when Australia\\u2019s agriculture minister threatened to put down the dogs (named Pistol and Boo) if they were not removed from the country. He had seen them when a groomer posted a photo on Facebook, and in a TV interview said he did not care that Mr. Depp had been voted the sexiest man alive; he still had to follow quarantine rules.\\\",\\\"The tabloids have dubbed the ongoing canine kerfuffle \\u201cthe war on terrier.\\u201d\\\",\\\"I deem it newsworthy only because a nervy dog owner finally was caught. These days half the people I know, myself included, are sneaking their dogs everywhere.\\\",\\\"I know one couple who take their undeclared Norwich terrier into France with as much thought as they would give carrying a loaf of bread out of a boulangerie, and another who sneak their Brussels griffon into Mexico, where I\\u2019ve seen them frolicking on the beach in Tulum.\\\",\\\"In this world of the privileged who won\\u2019t take no for an answer and will take pets everywhere, we sneak them onto flights to avoid steep fees and into hotels to do the same. And sometimes we sneak them into hotels that don\\u2019t allow dogs at all.\\\",\\\"We sneak them into restaurants, too, often by providing questionable letters from therapists or Internet outfits saying the animals offer us emotional support for anxiety disorders. And we keep getting away with it because laws are just unclear enough to intimidate anyone who questions a disability. Never mind that misrepresenting our pets as service animals (when, like mine, they don\\u2019t always behave like them) makes life more difficult for those who really need them.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIs that a service animal?\\u201d I heard a hostess ask a very healthy-looking young couple the other night as they entered a TriBeCa pub with a big black dog. They pulled out a letter, showed it, got the O.K. and proceeded to walk the dog through the restaurant as if they were on a sidewalk. I marveled at the nerve, although I myself have a letter from a psychologist that says I have a panic disorder and suffer from fear of crowds, and that my dog allays my symptoms.\\\",\\\"Making matters worse (or better, depending on your point of view), United Airlines recently placed \\u201ccomfort dogs\\u201d in seven airports \\u201cto help take some of the stress out of holiday travel for our customers.\\u201d (Another way to do that would be to stop charging $150 each way to have a small dog in a carrier bag under the seat.)\\\",\\\"It\\u2019s no wonder passengers like me are playing the emotional-support-animal game, although I\\u2019m not sure that entitles us to shamelessly walk our dogs around the airport as if they were no different than children with interesting haircuts.\\\",\\\"All of this is nothing new, even as it has become more common. To avoid having their four dogs set foot on English soil, which required a six-month quarantine,Elizabeth Taylorand Richard Burton lived on a yacht while he was filming a movie in the 1970s. Several decades later, the quarantine in Britain was lifted in time for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games.\\\",\\\"As goes the British government, so go all kinds of luxury hotels. After a recent premiere of his short film celebrating the new \\u201copen pet policy\\u201d at the W Hotel Times Square, Alan Cummingtold The New York Posthe can now sit at the bar with his dog.\\\",\\\"And this year, guests at the Standard no longer have to be sneaks to avoid a pet fee. An article on the hotel\\u2019s website featuring Anjelica Huston posing on a bed with several dogsannounces that two per guest are welcome free. Children, on the other hand, are (without irony) prohibited. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t ask questions,\\u201d Ms. Huston says of dogs in her interview. \\u201cThey just understand the answers.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In other news, Amtrak, after a decades-long pets ban, hasstarted allowing small cats and dogs on trains. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican, set things in motion when he realized he couldn\\u2019t ride with his French bulldog, Lily. \\u201cWe are always looking for ways to enhance the passenger experience,\\u201d an Amtrak spokesperson told The Washington Post.\\\",\\\"If only they had thought of that for the two years my husband and I were shuttling back and forth between New York and Washington for his job. Our options were either sneaking our longhaired miniature dachshund onto an insufferably slow bus, which was harrowing given her tendency to want to get out of her bag. Or we had to sneak her onto flights to avoid the outrageous fees that cost as much as our airfare.\\\",\\\"At least we had the perfect accessory for the crime: a small perforated black shoulder bag that looked more like a Chanel knockoff than a pet carrier.\\\",\\\"For a person who was annoyed by the entitlement of dog owners up until the moment I got one myself, I\\u2019ve become more cavalier than a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. I\\u2019ve taken my dog to restaurants, concerts, barbershops, tailors and therapy, where it is always noted that the dog\\u2019s name,Zoloft, is metaphorically, if not clinically, appropriate.\\\",\\\"Recently, when invited at the last minute to participate in a group reading in Miami, I brought Zoloft onto the stage and offended both audience and participants by inadvertently distracting the viewers from the readers.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a well-known rule,\\u201d one participant said, \\u201cthat dogs and children always upstage adults in performances.\\u201d It was a smack on the snout but also a wake-up call.\\\",\\\"Those with objections are biting back more, it seems. When The New York Times published an article aboutpet travel, there was a barrage of comments from allergy sufferers and people who did not want to share space with someone\\u2019s \\u201cfur child\\u201d as we who are obsessed call them.\\\",\\\"And now organizations like theBoard of Guide Dogs for the Blind,a California group, andCanine Companions for Independenceare taking up the issue of dubious service-dog designations by pushing the Department of Justice to regulate the sale of service animal equipment and IDs.\\\",\\\"As for Amber Heard, when she was caught last spring, she vowed never to return to Australia. That\\u2019s not possible because she is expected at her trial next year.\\\",\\\"Every dog has its day. And sometimes sneaky celebrities get their due.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 343174}"
