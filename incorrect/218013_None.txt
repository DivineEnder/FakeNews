Frank Wolf takes on Grover Norquist\", \"content\": \"Legend has it that ancient Rome was spared a devastating invasion by   the courage and skill of a great warrior named Horatius, whose   singlehanded defense of a bridge kept the enemy hordes at bay.   From   time to time, a contemporary figure exhibits similar heroic qualities,   earning this column\\u2019s \\u201cHoratius at the Bridge\\u201d award.   With his   \\u201cstatement of conscience\\u201d on the floor of the House of Representatives   last week, Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA) has become the latest recipient  of that distinction.On October 4, Rep. Wolf summarized in five-minutes a long insert he placed that day in the Congressional Record.  The immediate impetus  for this address was the sixteen-term  legislator\\u2019s concern about  Washington\\u2019s current inability to have a  constructive conversation  about tax reform.   The Congressman made clear  that he was not in favor  of raising taxes but warned that, \\u201cWe sit here  today shackled in  ideological gridlock.   Some insist that any discussion  of tax policy is  off the table.   Others reject any change in  entitlement programs\\u2026.  Powerful special interests continue to hold this  institution hostage  and undermine every good faith effort to change  course.\\u201dAfter  noting the role played by such Democratic special interests as   MoveOn.org, Mr. Wolf observed that \\u201cOn the Republican side, Grover   Norquist holds up the Americans for Tax Reform\\u2019s Taxpayer Protection   Pledge to block even the mention of putting tax reform on the table for   discussion as part of a deficit reduction agreement.\\u201d   Then, the   congressman asked:\\n\\nHoratius Wolf then added:\\n\\nThe Congressman proceeded  to give examples of Norquist\\u2019s troubling  associations and agendas.    These include: deep involvement with  convicted felon Jack Abramoff and  a record of ignoring congressional  subpoenas concerning same; lobbying  on behalf of the very mortgage  lending practices at Fannie Mae that  helped crater thehousing market and  economy; promoting the  proliferation of internet gambling and casinos;  and taking $4.3 million  from trial lawyer-turned-convicted felon Dickie  Scruggs.What  makes Frank Wolf\\u2019s bill of particulars heroic, however, is not just  his  taking on a prominent and influential Republican operative.   It is  the  documentation of the parts of Norquist\\u2019s advocacy and activities  that  are inimical to the national security.   These include:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt took  considerable courage for Frank Wolf to lay out this bill of   particulars.   While the factual basis for much of his statement has been   known for years, until now, no prominent official of the U.S.   government has been willing publicly to address \\u2013 let alone criticize \\u2013   such behavior and its ominous implications for the conservative   movement, the Republican Party and the nation.Congressman Wolf is  correct in his warning about the  insidious nature of Grover Norquist\\u2019s  various problematic associations  and agendas.   It is past time that  Americans of every political  persuasion and affiliation in every city,  community and region in this  country join him in standing up  to Norquist.   The alternative is to allow  Norquist associates and their  influence operations to continue to  infiltrate, divide and, inevitably,  weaken our country and cause.Frank Wolf is standing up for the  rest of us against such a  prospect like a true Horatius at the bridge.    Now, we must stand with  him.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
