This attack is so painfully reminiscent of the terrible attack at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris, and other ISIS-inspired attacks in recent years.\\u201d\\u201cThe fact that this shooting took place during Ramadan and that ISIS leadership in Raqqa has been urging attacks during this time, that the target was an LGBT nightclub during Pride, and \\u2014 if accurate \\u2014 that according to local law enforcement the shooter declared his allegiance to ISIS indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism,\\u201d Schiff added.\\u201dWhether this attack was also ISIS-directed, remains to be determined. I\\u2019m confident that we will know much more in the coming hours and days.\\u201dSchiff\\u2019s comments echoed those of Florida Sen.
