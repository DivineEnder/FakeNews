"{\"article_id\": 338798, \"content\": \"{\\\"It isn\\u2019t every day that the definition of a common English word that is ubiquitous in common parlance is challenged in federal court, but that is precisely what has happened with the word \\u201cnatural.\\u201d During the past few years, some 200 class-action suits have been filed against food manufacturers, charging them with misuse of the adjective in marketing such edible oxymorons as \\u201cnatural\\u201d Cheetos Puffs, \\u201call-natural\\u201d Sun Chips, \\u201call-natural\\u201d Naked Juice, \\u201c100 percent all-natural\\u201d Tyson chicken nuggets and so forth. The plaintiffs argue that many of these products contain ingredients \\u2014 high-fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors and colorings, chemical preservatives and genetically modified organisms \\u2014 that the typical consumer wouldn\\u2019t think of as \\u201cnatural.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Judges hearing these cases \\u2014 many of them in the Northern District of California \\u2014 have sought a standard definition of the adjective that they could cite to adjudicate these claims, only to discover that no such thing exists.\\\",\\\"Something in the human mind, or heart, seems to need a word of praise for all that humanity hasn\\u2019t contaminated, and for us that word now is \\u201cnatural.\\u201d Such an ideal can be put to all sorts of rhetorical uses. Among the antivaccination crowd, for example, it\\u2019s not uncommon to read about the superiority of something called \\u201cnatural immunity,\\u201d brought about by exposure to the pathogen in question rather than to the deactivated (and therefore harmless) version of it made by humans in laboratories. \\u201cWhen you inject a vaccine into the body,\\u201d reads a post on an antivaxxer website, Campaign for Truth in Medicine, \\u201cyou\\u2019re actually performing an unnatural act.\\u201d This, of course, is the very same term once used to decry homosexuality and, more recently, same-sex marriage, which the Family Research Council has taken to comparing unfavorably to what it calls \\u201cnatural marriage.\\u201d\\\",\\\"So what are we really talking about when we talk about natural? It depends; the adjective is impressively slippery, its use steeped in dubious assumptions that are easy to overlook. Perhaps the most incoherent of these is the notion that nature consists of everything in the world except us and all that we have done or made. In our heart of hearts, it seems, we are all creationists.\\\",\\\"In the case of \\u201cnatural immunity,\\u201d the modifier implies the absence of human intervention, allowing for a process to unfold as it would if we did nothing, as in \\u201cletting nature take its course.\\u201d In fact, most of medicine sets itselfagainstnature\\u2019s course, which is precisely what we like about it \\u2014 at least when it\\u2019s saving us from dying, an eventuality that is perhaps more natural than it is desirable.\\\",\\\"Yet sometimes medicine\\u2019s interventions are unwelcome or go overboard, and nature\\u2019s way of doing things can serve as a useful corrective. This seems to be especially true at the beginning and end of life, where we\\u2019ve seen a backlash against humanity\\u2019s technological ingenuity that has given us both \\u201cnatural childbirth\\u201d and, more recently, \\u201cnatural death.\\u201d\\\",\\\"This last phrase, which I expect will soon be on many doctors\\u2019 lips, indicates the enduring power of the adjective to improve just about anything you attach it to, from cereal bars all the way on up to dying. It seems that getting end-of-life patients and their families to endorse \\u201cdo not resuscitate\\u201d orders has been challenging. To many ears, \\u201cD.N.R.\\u201d sounds a little too much like throwing Grandpa under the bus. Butaccording to a paper in The Journal of Medical Ethics, when the orders are reworded to say \\u201callow natural death,\\u201d patients and family members and even medical professionals are much more likely to give their consent to what amounts to exactly the same protocols.\\\",\\\"The word means something a little different when applied to human behavior rather than biology (let alone snack foods). When marriage or certain sexual practices are described as \\u201cnatural,\\u201d the word is being strategically deployed as a synonym for \\u201cnormal\\u201d or \\u201ctraditional,\\u201d neither of which carries nearly as much rhetorical weight. \\u201cNormal\\u201d is by now too obviously soaked in moral bigotry; by comparison, \\u201cnatural\\u201d seems to float high above human squabbling, offering a kind of secular version of what used to be called divine law. Of course, that\\u2019s exactly the role that \\u201cnatural law\\u201d played for America\\u2019s founding fathers, who invoked nature rather than God as the granter of rights and the arbiter of right and wrong.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTraditional\\u201d marriage might be a more defensible term, but traditional is a much weaker modifier than natural. Tradition changes over time and from culture to culture, and so commands a fraction of the authority of nature, which we think of as timeless and universal, beyond the reach of messy, contested history.\\\",\\\"Implicit here is the idea that nature is a repository of abiding moral and ethical values \\u2014 and that we can say with confidence exactly what those values are. Philosophers often call this the \\u201cnaturalistic fallacy\\u201d: the idea that whateveris(in nature) is whatought to be(in human behavior). But if nature offers a moral standard by which we can measure ourselves, and a set of values to which we should aspire, exactly what sort of values are they? Are they the brutally competitive values of \\u201cnature, red in tooth and claw,\\u201d in which every individual is out for him- or herself? Or are they the values of cooperation on display in a beehive or ant colony, where the interests of the community trump those of the individual? Opponents of same-sex marriage can find examples of monogamy in the animal kingdom, and yet to do so they need to look past equally compelling examples of animal polygamy as well as increasing evidence of apparent animal homosexuality. And let\\u2019s not overlook the dismaying rates of what looks very much like rape in the animal kingdom, or infanticide, or the apparent sadism of your average house cat.\\\",\\\"The American Puritans called nature \\u201cGod\\u2019s Second Book,\\u201d and they read it for moral guidance, just as we do today. Yet in the same way we can rummage around in the Bible and find textual support for pretty much whatever we want to do or argue, we can ransack nature to justify just about anything. Like the maddening whiteness of Ahab\\u2019s whale, nature is an obligingly blank screen on which we can project what we want to see.\\\",\\\"So does this mean that, when it comes to saying what\\u2019s natural, anything goes? I don\\u2019t think so. In fact, I think there\\u2019s some philosophical wisdom we can harvest from, of all places, the Food and Drug Administration. When the federal judges couldn\\u2019t find a definition of \\u201cnatural\\u201d to apply to the class-action suits before them, three of them wrote to the F.D.A., ordering the agency to define the word. But the F.D.A. had considered the question several times before, and refused to attempt a definition. The only advice the F.D.A. was willing to offer the jurists is that a food labeled \\u201cnatural\\u201d should have \\u201cnothing artificial or synthetic\\u201d in it \\u201cthat would not normally be expected in the food.\\u201d TheF.D.A. states on its websitethat \\u201cit is difficult to define a food product as \\u2018natural\\u2019 because the food has probably been processed and is no longer the product of the earth,\\u201d suggesting that the industry might not want to press the point too hard, lest it discover thatnothingit sells is natural.\\\",\\\"The F.D.A.\\u2019s philosopher-bureaucrats are probably right: At least at the margins, it\\u2019s impossible to fix a definition of \\u201cnatural.\\u201d Yet somewhere between those margins there lies a broad expanse of common sense. \\u201cNatural\\u201d has a fairly sturdy antonym \\u2014 artificial, or synthetic \\u2014 and, at least on a scale of relative values, it\\u2019s not hard to say which of two things is \\u201cmore natural\\u201d than the other: cane sugar or high-fructose corn syrup? Chicken or chicken nuggets? G.M.O.s or heirloom seeds? The most natural foods in the supermarket seldom bother with the word; any food product that feels compelled to tell you it\\u2019s natural in all likelihood is not.\\\",\\\"But it is probably unwise to venture beyond the shores of common sense, for it isn\\u2019t long before you encounter either Scylla or Charybdis. At one extreme end of the spectrum of possible meanings, there\\u2019s nothingbutnature. Our species is a result of the same process \\u2014 natural selection \\u2014 that created every other species, meaning that we and whatever we do are natural, too. So go ahead and call your nuggets natural: It\\u2019s like saying they\\u2019re made with matter, or molecules, which is to say, it\\u2019s like saying nothing at all.\\\",\\\"And yet at the opposite end of the spectrum of meaning, where humanity in some sense stands outside nature \\u2014 as most of us still unthinkingly believe \\u2014 what is left of the natural that we haven\\u2019t altered in some way? We\\u2019re mixed up with all of it now, from the chemical composition of the atmosphere to the genome of every plant or animal in the supermarket to the human body itself, which has long since evolved in response to cultural practices we invented, like agriculture and cooking. Nature, if you believe in human exceptionalism, is over. We probably ought to search elsewhere for our values.\\\"}\", \"title\": \"Why \\u2018Natural\\u2019 Doesn\\u2019t Mean Anything Anymore\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
