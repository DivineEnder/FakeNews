He and two other members of the group were outside the centre, located in Conway Square in Newtownards, to shoot a short video about the rise of Islam in the United Kingdom.Within minutes of arriving, they were confronted by \\u201ca car load\\u201d of local Muslim youths who questioned them on what they were doing there. The video shot by the group has since been uploaded to their Facebook page.Wearing a shirt emblazoned with a large cross, Paul Golding, can be seen addressing the camera, described the building as \\u201can enormous mosque\\u201d. He explains: \\u201cas you can see, it looks just like a normal residential front of a house, but if you look down the side you can see it goes back 300, 400 foot. It really is an enormous mosque.\\u201cWe\\u2019ve had reports from the residents here that come prayer time on Friday this whole area is absolutely filled with Muslims.\\u201cA lot of people in Northern Ireland rest on their laurels. The first thing that they say is: \\u201cwe haven\\u2019t got the same problems over here than what you\\u2019ve got in England. My response is always the same: it\\u2019s coming. It will happen, just give it time.\\u201dAbdul Robb, from the Bangladesh Islamic Community Centre in the town has told The Irish News: \\u201cWe are very friendly with the local people. They are only doing it for publicity.\\u201dNewtownards DUP councillor Naomi Armstrong-Cotter said there had been \\u201cno issues\\u201d with the prayer centre, as the members had not been proselytising.\\u201cThere were concerns raised at the time that it would become a hub, but that has not been the case. Groups from across the area have made an effort to integrate with them and have had cooking lessons from the Bangladeshis,\\u201d she said.\\u201cThey keep themselves to themselves. There is no proselytising going on here. Local people know it is here and haven\\u2019t had any issue.\\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t fit with Newtownards. It is just about people getting on with their normal lives and that is the way it should be.\\u201dPolice Northern Ireland have confirmed that they are investigating an allegation of a hate incident in relation to the presence of the men, and asked a witness who originally contacted them to get back in touch.\\u00a0\", \"article_id\": 134848}"
