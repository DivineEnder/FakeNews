"{\"title\": \"David Byrne: Why Can't Stupid Americans See Through Trump's 'Lies and Bullsh*t?'\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"In the essay posted to his website, Byrne hypothesized that the \\u201cend of the American dream\\u201d and the rise of a social media that utilizes algorithms based on user preferences have combined to boost Trump\\u2019s popularity.He also repeatedly criticized\\u00a0Trump\\u00a0for what he called the\\u00a0\\u201cridiculousness of many of his positions and ideas\\u201d and accused the candidate of running for president for his own personal gain.The musician began by crediting special interest money in politics with much of the anger Americans feel toward government:One reason why folks on either side of the party line are angry with how things stand is that both sides sense that Congress is beholden to the money of special interests and consequently the voice of the people goes unheard. Democrats might blame the Koch brothers and I\\u2019m sure that conservatives blame some outside influences, too. The decision to bailout the banks doesn\\u2019t sit right with some, and others feel that the government wants to regulate their private lives.\\u201cAdd to that the feeling of impotence \\u2014 that traditional remedies and corrections aren\\u2019t effective anymore \\u2014 and you have a pretty explosive cocktail,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cThis probably drives a lot of Sanders supporters too, though my bias leads me to assume that Sanders isn\\u2019t propagating outright lies and misconceptions \\u2014 he\\u2019s actually addressing issues and not simply massaging his ego and building his brand.\\u201dHaving examined the cause of the country\\u2019s anger and after revealing his own presidential preference, Byrne questioned how \\u201cfolks continue to ignore facts.\\u201d The musician pinned the blame on the \\u201cinsularity\\u201d of social media services like Facebook and Twitter:The problem with Facebook and Twitter is that those platforms mostly present a point of view that you already agree with, since you only see what \\u00a0your \\u201cfriends\\u201d are sharing. We all do this to some extent\\u2014your friends share news with you and presumably many of your friends share your viewpoints. The algorithms built into those social networks are designed to reinforce this natural human tendency and expand upon it\\u2014if you like this, you\\u2019ll like this. The networks reinforce your existing point of view in order to give you more of what you like, as that will make you happy and keep you on the network\\u2014and, in turn, more ads can be accurately targeted your way. You remain blissfully happy \\u201cknowing\\u201d or, rather, believing, more and more about less and less. Add that algorithm to folks\\u2019 natural inclination to seek points of view that confirm existing biases and you\\u2019ve got a potent combination. Once you\\u2019ve surrounded yourself with only one point of view, soon that point of view is all you hear.\\u201cThat is why, a friend argued, Trump supporters are immune to criticism and to the exposure of his lies and false accusations: for the most part these algorithms and subsequent self-censorship make it so that they never see anything but what they already agree with,\\u201d Byrne wrote.\\u201cAs often happens when groups of like-minded individuals discuss something, the result is that their points of view are not only reinforced but also become more extreme.\\u201dRead the rest of Byrne\\u2019s essay on his website.\", \"article_id\": 292438}"
