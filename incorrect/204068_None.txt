"{\"title\": \"'Kill the Jews': European Ministers Denounce Anti-Semitic Demonstrations and Attacks\", \"content\": \" In a joint statement from Brussels, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Laurent Fabius and Federica Mogherini denounced \\u201cthe ugly anti-Semitic statements, demonstrations and attacks of the last few days,\\u201d declaring that \\u201cnothing, including the dramatic military confrontation in Gaza, justifies such actions in Europe.\\u201d\\u201cAt a time when \\u2018Death to the Jews\\u2019 chants can be heard at public gatherings in European capitals, allegedly in protests against Israel, the bold, timely and unambiguous words of the three foreign ministers send a strong message that should be embraced by all EU member states,\\u201d said David Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee.Primarily Arab and Muslim demonstrators have taken to the streets across the continent in protest of Israel\\u2019s military incursion into the Hamas-controlled Gaza strip. Throngs have attacked synagogues and chanted pejorative slogans about Jews and Israel.On Sunday in the Parisian suburb of Sarcelles, an Arab mob burned cars, attacked Jewish owned shops and clashed with members of the Jewish community outside of a synagogue, which the rioters attempted to set aflame. That incident was one of several incidents of attacks against Jewish places of worship in the greater Paris area, including the siege of a downtown synagogue full of Jews just over a week ago.Demonstrators were overheard screaming \\u201cJew, Jew, cowardly pig, come on out and fight\\u201d at a recent Berlin protest and protesters in Antwerp were reported to have marched while chanting \\u201ckill the Jews.\\u201d There have been two separate reported incidents of men being beaten for flying Israeli flags in Sweden, according to local media.Jewish organizations have been pushing for tougher action on the issue of anti-Semitism, especially since the murder of four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels in May. Jewish organizations have rejected the pretense that the anti-Semitic acts are merely expressions of protest against Israeli military action.\\u201cThe pretence that these attacks are not anti-Semitic, but merely a reaction to current events in the Middle East, is cynical and decidedly false. When a Paris mob besieges and throws bricks at a synagogue with 200 congregants inside, it is anti-Semitism. When a synagogue north of Paris is firebombed on Friday night and sustains damage, it is anti-Semitism. When a 17-year-old girl \\u2014 referred to as a \\u2018dirty Jewess\\u2019 \\u2014 is assaulted on a Paris street by having her face pepper-sprayed, it is anti-Semitism,\\u201d said American communal group Agudath Israel.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 204068}"
