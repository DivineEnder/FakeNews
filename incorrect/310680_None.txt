"{\"article_id\": 310680, \"title\": \"Customs Notified FBI of Chelsea Bomber's Trips to Pakistan and Afghanistan\", \"content\": \"CNN reports that Customs and Border Protection officers interviewed him at the airport when he returned from his year-long sojourn in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region\\u00a0in 2014, logged him into an inter-agency law enforcement database, and reported him\\u00a0to the FBI and other agencies as \\u201csomeone who investigators should be aware of given his travel and the amount of time spent in areas associated with terrorist groups.\\u201dThis notice was sent\\u00a0before\\u00a0Rahami\\u2019s father reported him to the FBI as a potential terrorist.It should be noted that, contrary to widespread media coverage,\\u00a0Mohammed Rahami did not change his mind and retract his report to the FBI. Rather, the Bureau investigated and told the elder Rahami that they\\u00a0found \\u201cno derogatory information whatsoever,\\u201d as one FBI official put it to NJ.com. Only then did Mohammed Rahami \\u201crecant\\u201d his report.A federal law enforcement official told CNN Ahmad Rahami was not \\u201csingled out\\u201d for special scrutiny by Customs, but was reported as part of a \\u201cbatch\\u201d of people who \\u201ctraveled to high-risk areas. The official described such bulletins as \\u201cpretty common.\\u201dThe official added that FBI investigators would have questioned Rahami if he had raised any \\u201cred flags\\u201d during the Customs interview. The system was explained in detail to CNN:The senior law enforcement official, explaining the process for secondary screening, said if additional concerns are raised during secondary screening, two additional steps can be taken. An interagency report with information about the traveler can be sent forward immediately to law enforcement and intelligence agencies or the information can be integrated into the Customs and Border Protection\\u2019s National Targeting Center\\u2019s weekly report.If the concern is more serious, the screeners can refer the traveler to an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI. Representatives from the task force are co-located at airports like JFK and Newark due to the high volume of travelers that are a concern.Another lingering question about Rahami was whether he acted alone. Law enforcement has given some conflicting signals about whether they suspect he had accomplices.According to a Fox News report, statements that the bomber probably had accomplices have been made\\u00a0by Jamie Reyes, who owns an establishment called \\u201cSonia\\u2019s Beauty Color Express,\\u201d located near the Rahami family\\u2019s chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, New Jersey.\\u201cI have known him for such a long time, he was not alone. There is no way that Ahmad was alone in this. He made bad connections,\\u201d said Reyes.\\u201cKnowing him for such a long time, he was not alone,\\u201d Reyes repeated.Reyes added that Ahmad\\u2019s father Mohammad was \\u201cvery strict,\\u201d worried about his children losing their Afghan heritage, and was \\u201cnot happy when Ahmad fathered a baby girl with a former girlfriend who was Dominican.\\u201dAccording to Reyes, the elder Rahami wanted all of his sons to travel to Afghanistan to get married and recently indicated that one of his sons is, in fact, currently on a trip to Afghanistan for that purpose.Mohammad Rahami also allegedly told Reyes that he liked sending his boys to Afghanistan because \\u201che would take their phones away so all they would do was pray\\u201d and also lose weight.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
