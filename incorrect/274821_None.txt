"{\"title\": \"American in Munich: Jews Safer in Germany Than US\", \"content\": \"\\u201cIf I think Germany\\u2019s that unsafe for Jews I have no business being here,\\u201d journalist\\u00a0Terry Swartzberg said to Germany-based news site The Local. Swartzberg, 61, is from America and moved to Germany in 1979. He said he had not experienced any anti-Semitism over the course of the 27 months he\\u2019s been wearing his kippah; a reality that is starkly different\\u00a0from a Jewish man in Paris recently or another in Copenhagen\\u00a0prior to that.According to The Local, Swartzberg\\u00a0said he was inspired to wear the kippah two years ago at the funeral of a friend, Mietek Pemper, a Holocaust survivor who helped Oskar Schindler compile his famous list. Upon leaving the cemetery, all the Jews removed their yarmulkes except him. \\u201cI walked out wearing it, and they start screaming at me, you\\u2019re putting us all in danger.\\u201dSwartzberg suggested that Germany is a much safer place for Jewish people than America is, although he does not discount the presence of racism. \\u201cI know what anti-Semitism is,\\u201d he told The Local, citing how he \\u201cgrew up in America, where 34% of people describe themselves as being anti-Semitic\\u201d and that he \\u201cwent to school in India and worked as a journalist in Hong Kong.\\u201dYet he noted that \\u201cit\\u2019s such a cheap shot and so unfair [to say Jews aren\\u2019t safe in Germany], because Germany has done amazing things that I wish my own country, the USA would do.\\u201dSwartzberg told The Local that he intends to continue wearing his kippah as part of his\\u00a0campaign to proudly push Jewish identity in Munich. He is also\\u00a0the\\u00a0president of Stolpersteine,\\u00a0which seeks to commemorate Holocaust victims with brass memorial plaques that are placed outside of victims\\u2019 former homes.\\u201cI work every day for the Stolpersteine, I know what Germany did and I will never let Germans forget,\\u201d Swartzberg said.Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 274821}"
