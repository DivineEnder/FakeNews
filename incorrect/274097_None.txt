"{\"title\": \"Iraq Vet Lawmaker Warns on Eve of Nuclear Deal: Iran 'Killed a Lot of My Friends'\", \"content\": \"WASHINGTON, D.C. \\u2014 Rep. Steve Russell (R-OK), when asked to comment\\u00a0on the nuclear talks between U.S.-led world powers and Iran, said it is important to remember that Iran was behind the killing of many American soldiers in Iraq.\\u201cI don\\u2019t trust this governing council or the Ayatollah that runs the country [Iran]. They have exported terror around the world. They have disrupted the Middle East. They occupy four capitals in the region now with their proxies and cronies,\\u201d Russell, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, told Breitbart News.\\u201cThe other problem that we see with them is they killed a lot of my friends,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cThese EFP [Explosively Formed Projectiles] roadside bombs that they exported into Iraq with explicit instructions that they should only be used against Americans \\u2014 we cannot forget that. The lowest estimate I\\u2019ve seen is at least 1,000 of our warriors who died in Iraq were at their hands. I have a tough time believing in their good will.\\u201dRep. Russell noted that the U.S. needs to receive proof of good behavior from Iran before it lifts any sanctions as part of a nuclear deal.\\u201cI think to expect the opposite where we lift sanctions and then they will promise good behavior is a non-starter,\\u201d explained the retired Army Ranger. \\u201cI also think that, when we\\u2019re relying on the safety of the Western world and Israel to be on the back of the good will of the people that govern Iran, we\\u2019re in trouble.\\u201dThe congressman told Breitbart News that the safety of the Western world hangs in the balance as the so-called P5+1 (U.S., U.K., France, Russia, and China plus Germany) attempt to hash out a nuclear agreement with Iran.Today, March 31, is the self-imposed deadline for a framework understanding between the six world powers and Iran.\\u201cI know from the initial discussions that they [the world powers] are looking to ease sanctions based upon inspections and compliance. We will ease and they will comply. I think it\\u2019s just the opposite that needs to happen,\\u201d said Congressman Russell. \\u201cThey need to comply and then we will look to ease.\\u201d\\u201cThis whole idea of their enriched uranium stockpiles \\u2014 that they\\u2019re unwilling to give that up now\\u2026 These are all real problems,\\u201d he added.Representatives involved in the negations are reportedly preparing to issue a general statement focusing on certain aspects of the agreement.Obama\\u2019s White House issued a statement saying that nuclear talks could be extended past the March 31 deadline if enough progress is made to justify such a move.\\u201cIf it\\u2019s necessary \\u2014 and, when I say if it\\u2019s necessary I mean if it\\u2019s midnight and a deal has not been reached but the conversations continue to be productive \\u2014 we\\u2019ll be prepared to continue the talks into tomorrow,\\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, adding, \\u201cIf we are making progress toward the finish line, than we should keep going.\\u201dU.S.-led Western diplomats are working towards reaching a deal with Iran that would restrict (\\u201cfreeze\\u201d) its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of international sanctions.Rep. Russell and other lawmakers have expressed concern about Iran\\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East.Follow Edwin Mora on Twitter: @EdwinMora83\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 274097}"
