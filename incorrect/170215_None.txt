"{\"title\": \"Iraqi Immigrant Arrested in Texas After Pledging Allegiance to ISIS\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"A naturalized American citizen from Iraq named Bilal Abood was arrested by FBI agents in Texas on Thursday, on charges of lying to law enforcement about his formal pledge of allegiance to ISIS and its \\u201ccaliph,\\u201d Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Abood worked as a translator for the U.S. military before moving to the United States. \\u00a0He was living in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite at the time of his arrest, and was a licensed security guard, according to NBC 5 News in Dallas.Abood has been on the counter-terrorist radar screen since 2013, when he was prevented from boarding a flight to the Middle East at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and interviewed by the FBI. \\u00a0He initially claimed he wanted to visit his family in Iraq, but later admitted his intention was to make his way to Syria and take up arms against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. \\u00a0At the time, he said his sympathies lay with the Free Syrian Army, a prominent\\u00a0\\u201cmoderate\\u201d rebel group supported by the U.S. government.The\\u00a0New York Times\\u00a0says that about a month later, an FBI informant said Abood was \\u201cwatching videos about the Islamic State and had said that he wanted to support it.\\u201d \\u00a0He made another attempt to reach Syria, this time traveling from Mexico to Turkey first, and was successful.Upon his return to Texas in September 2013, he told the FBI he spent his time in Syria training with the FSA, but \\u201cbecame frustrated with a lack of action,\\u201d so he gave up and returned to the U.S.At this point, the Abood saga assumes a rather\\u2026\\u00a0leisurely\\u00a0pace, considering he had all the telltale signs of a \\u201clone wolf\\u201d jihadi. \\u00a0Ten months after Abood came home from Syria, the FBI obtained a warrant, searched his computer, and found his oath of fealty to the Islamic State \\u201ccaliphate,\\u201d delivered via Twitter.NBC 5 says his browser history also indicated a taste for ISIS beheading videos, and he used Twitter to spread information about Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Evidently the Bureau kept this discovery quiet, because nine months later, agents asked him about his pledge of allegiance to ISIS, which he falsely denied making. \\u00a0Another month would elapse before Abood\\u2019s arrest on Thursday.\\u201cIt was not clear why agents waited nearly a year to arrest him,\\u201d writes NBC 5 News \\u00a0\\u201cAbood does not face a terrorism charge, and there is no allegation he was planning any attacks in the United States.\\u201dFBI officials told the\\u00a0New York Times\\u00a0the timing of the arrest \\u201creflected increasing wariness about the possible threat posed by known devotees of the Islamic State inside the United States.\\u201dThe\\u00a0Dallas Morning News\\u00a0says that \\u201cif found guilty, Abood is looking at eight years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.\\u201dThe obvious reason for leaving Abood to his own devices for a year would be keeping him under surveillance and hoping he led agents to other suspicious individuals. \\u00a0CNN suggests the jihad attack on Pamela Geller\\u2019s Mohammed Art Exhibit in Garland, Texas prompted more aggressive action against \\u201clone wolf\\u201d suspects already under observation, saying FBI Director James Corner \\u201cordered counterterrorism investigators last week to reassess cases of people who the FBI was already tracking to determine whether more action was necessary against suspects.\\u201dThe emphasis now, according to what officials told CNN, is on \\u201cmoving more\\u00a0quickly to take possible threats off the streets, instead of waiting longer to monitor and build an investigation against suspects.\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"article_id\": 170215}"
