"{\"content\": \"{\\\"WhatOkkyung Lee does on the cellois often called \\u201cextended technique,\\u201d which means producing sounds by unusual means. But she more or less obliterates the need for the term. When she keeps her fingers choked up on the neck, pointing downward near the bridge, or rubs her bow against the strings to make sluicing sounds and hard, guttural rips, this is her standard; this is her usual. It\\u2019s part of her language.\\\",\\\"So is the balanced, sonorous tone of classical technique, when she wants to use it. Ms. Lee has a lot of technique and is grounded by it. But \\u201cextended\\u201d implies extra or unconventional, and living exclusively in the unconventional can lead to a kind of aesthetic provincialism. She\\u2019s not provincial.\\\",\\\"For three nights this week, Ms. Lee has a residency atJack, the arts space in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, performing in different combinations. On Wednesday, the first night, she played a freely improvised set with the drummersChris CorsanoandChes Smith, whose curiosity and range of expression fit well with her. The trio could be a band, and it sometimes sounded like one, but the first thing she announced was that the three hadn\\u2019t played together in nine years.\\\",\\\"That\\u2019s normal. Like a lot of established free improvisers, Ms. Lee can seem basically international, flying around to small festivals and performance spaces to play in ad hoc groups or solo. This hasn\\u2019t diluted her. Ms. Lee was born in Korea, studied composition and improvisation at music schools in Boston, and moved to New York in 2000, eventually playing with all kinds of improvisers, musical or otherwise. (On Friday, she will perform with the dancer Michelle Boul\\u00e9.) Since then, her sound has grown more concentrated and refined. When you hear her now, you\\u2019re getting pure intent. Depending on the sound system of the club, or the sonics of the recording \\u2014 her recent solo record\\u201cGhil\\u201dreally puts your ear next to her instrument, or inside it \\u2014 that intent becomes physical. Her playing is calm and steady: It doesn\\u2019t present itself as strange or ask for your permission. It\\u2019s serious, but not wearying.\\\",\\\"On Wednesday, the two drummers quickly became fluent and fast, and staked out their differences. Mr. Corsano worked like a hummingbird, swift and light and quickly changing his focus between areas of the drum kit, even the rims and the sides, using sticks and bows to extract sound. Mr. Smith, on a drum kit and a glockenspiel to his left, held steadier, more repetitive patterns.\\\",\\\"The three worked in general woolly agreement and then in sudden specifics. For a minute or two, they formed a dense polyrhythm of clicks; for a different minute or two, they all found ways to draw whinnying cries from their instruments; for a shorter period, they all grew extremely quiet and regular in tempo.\\\",\\\"For her part, Ms. Lee played as if she were pointing out a hundred hidden uses of a familiar object, and squaring that number through combinations of right- and left-hand actions. With her left, she made fast single-note fingerings, or pressed the side of her hand across the neck, or plucked the open note of the lowest string with her thumb while rubbing another string with the tip of her index finger. With her right, she often changed the angle of her bow against the strings, and the grip of her hand on the bow. All of these movements produced different results \\u2014 rubbings and harmonics and glissandos and single tones and rough noise \\u2014 and the switching among them was as much a part of the improvisation as the sound.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 343285, \"title\": \"Review: The Cellist Okkyung Lee Tests Extended Technique\\u2019s Boundaries\"}"
