"{\"title\": \"Dershowitz Asks: Does Jimmy Carter's Support for Hamas Constitute a Criminal Offense?\", \"content\": \"\\tRecently retired Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz told J.D. Hayworth at Newsmax TV that Carter\\u2019s recent article in London\\u2019s Guardian Newspaper,\\u00a0urging international recognition for Hamas, may have constituted recruitment for an organization classified as \\u2018terrorist\\u2019 under US law. Dershowitz accused Jimmy Carter of being \\u201can all-out supporter of Hamas,\\u201d warning that if his advocacy turns into material support for the terrorist Hamas, Carter will be committing a felony.\\u00a0\\n\\u201cJimmy Carter wants the United States and the European community to legitimize Hamas,\\u201d said Dershowitz. \\u201cIt\\u2019s against the law in the United States, even if you\\u2019re a former president, it\\u2019s against the law to provide material support to a listed terrorist organization.\\u201d\\tDershowitz claims that Carter\\u2019s call for the recognition of Hamas as an equal with Israel \\u201cdefies logic. But leave it to Jimmy Carter,\\u201d said Dershowitz to defy logic. \\u201cIt\\u2019s as if one would want to recognize and legitimate the Mafia or al-Qaida or the Taliban,\\u201d he said.Unlike democratic Israel said Dershowitz, \\u201cHamas murders its opponents, engaged in coup d\\u2019\\u00e9tats, kneecaps critics, uses children as soldiers, 160 some odd children were killed building these tunnels, and it uses child warriors. But Jimmy Carter stands behind Hamas.\\u201d\\u201cThere was a plan for Hamas to use all 40 of the tunnels on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, this year the end of September, and have a massive attack hoping to kill thousands of Israeli civilians and the destruction of the tunnels may have prevented this massacre, which would have resulted in an all-out war, obviously, in the Middle East and it may have taken close to 70 Israeli soldiers, this massacre, but if that report is correct, then everything Israel did was completely proportional.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u201cHas Jimmy Carter read the Hamas charter?\\u201d asks Dershowitz? \\u201cThe charter says that Hamas to fulfill Allah\\u2019s prophecy and Mohammed\\u2019s prophecy of killing every Jew standing behind every rock. It blames all the world\\u2019s ills past and present on the Jews and this is the organization that Jimmy Carter is standing behind and cheerleading for?\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 193644}"
