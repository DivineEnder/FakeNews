"{\"title\": \"No, Monbiot: Britain Needs More Wolves Like it Needs the Black Death\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"He is incensed that the government is preparing to pass a bill in which any animal species that \\u201cis not ordinarily resident in, or a regular visitor to, Great Britain in a wild state\\u201d will be classified as non-native and subject to potential \\u201ceradication or control\\u201d.Monbiot lists some of the former British natives that fit into this category. They include: the lynx; the wolf, the European beaver; the brown bear; the spotted hyena; the lion; the wolverine; and the blue stag beetle.What maddens Monbiot is that by declaring all such\\u00a0 species personae non gratae the government is trampling on his latest masterplan \\u2013 explained in more detail in his latest book Feral \\u2013 to repopulate Britain\\u2019s landscape with exotic beasties.Apparently there is great public appetite for this. Or so he claims:Some would be widely welcomed; others not at all, but it\\u2019s clear that a debate about which species we might bring back is one that many people in this country want to have, but that the government wants to terminate.In your perfervid dreams, George. The only people who could possibly want any of these ravening creatures re-introduced to the British countryside \\u2013 though we\\u2019ll let you have your blue stag beetle \\u2013 are a) Guardian-readers or b) useful idiots so pitifully ill-informed, sentimental and incapable of rational thought that it has simply never once occurred to them what the consequences of this would be.Let\\u2019s consider wolves, one of the main candidates for reintroduction. This scheme has the support of the John Muir Trust and also of Paul Lister, a furniture millionaire who owns 23,000 acres of Scotland.\\nPossibly so, but there are plenty of non-ecological reasons, as disastrous rewilding projects like the return of wolves to Yellowstone Park has demonstrated. The thing about wolves, as cattle ranchers on the edge of Yellowstone Park have discovered to their cost, is that they don\\u2019t play by the rules. In the environmentalists\\u2019 imaginations, what wolves do on being reintroduced to the wild is recreate a lost world of Thoreau-esque innocence, living in perfect balance with nature, feeding only on game.What wolves actually do, though \\u2013 and have done in Yellowstone: see the documentary Crying Wolf \\u2013 is pick the easiest target. Yes, they\\u2019ve trashed the local elk populations too, but their main prey has been cattle livestock, which they either kill or hamstring or render near worthless because of stress-induced weight-loss.Of course, this human suffering and economic loss has proved of little interest to environmentalists like Monbiot because in their Weltanschauung, human beings are but one verminous species among many.\", \"article_id\": 204099}"
