In March, Britain\\u2019s Guardian newspaper published emails it sourced to Syrian opposition activists.The messages appeared to catch the glamorous wife of Syrian President Bashar Assad shopping for pricey shoes while her country slipped toward civil war.Harrison said the WikiLeaks emails dated from August 2006 to March 2012 and originated from hundreds of different domains, including Syria\\u2019s ministry of presidential affairs.Harrison said her group was \\u201cstatistically confident\\u201d that the body of material was genuine.Assange, who is currently seeking asylum at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, was not at the brief presentation.
