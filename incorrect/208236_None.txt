"{\"article_id\": 208236, \"title\": \"'Breitbart News Sunday' Special: JFK, Conservative?\", \"content\": \"First up was former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. In her book,\\u00a0Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, which Bannon refers to as a deeply religious one, Palin assailed the left and the secularists of America. She said that they are doing all they can to strip American culture of its symbols of Christmas. Palin posited that this whitewashing of Christmas is the \\u201ctip of a spear\\u201d of a much larger war of eradicating America\\u2019s fundamental Judeo-Christian values. Citing founding father John Adams, Palin made her point that the left ignores that \\u201cthe Constitution was designed for a moral and religious person.\\u201d Bannon made sure Palin shared the segment in her book about her Orwellian vision of America in 2028 where the government constantly reminds us that the \\u201cgovernment know best.\\u201d Bannon and Palin both have children defending freedom while serving in our Armed Services. Palin said that she feels proud and \\u201csacrificial\\u201d because her first son serves in combat. The Governor went on to thank all at Breitbart News for promoting American exceptionalism. She stated, \\u201cAs we lose more freedoms we will fundamentally transform\\u201d America to a place that is not exceptional.\\u00a0The Governor offered her insights into the JFK years, praising the former President because he \\u201cbelieved in personal freedom, and was bold to talk about scripture and the Judeo-Christian ethic.\\u201d He also showed imagination with his decision to promote our space program, the former Alaska Governor noted. She drew a comparison to Obama, saying that our current President lacked Kennedy\\u2019s leadership.\\u00a0Next on the program was Ira Stoll, who discussed his new book\\u00a0JFK, Conservative. Convincingly, Stoll argued that Kennedy\\u2019s \\u201cNew Frontier,\\u201d touted by liberals as a promise for new spending on education and more medical care for the elderly, was in fact a conservative thrust. He supported tax reduction and an increase in military spending. What\\u2019s more, Stoll insisted Kennedy\\u2019s social agenda was conservative as well. Kennedy supported capital punishment, restricted the welfare state,and emphasized creating jobs in private industry. A vigorous Cold War warrior, Stoll claimed, Kennedy was first to call out communism as the evil empire in his famous speech in Germany in 1963.\\u00a0Stoll noted the reference in a speech that shows Kennedy knew about the intrinsic evils of the communist takeover of Germany:There are many people in the world who really don\\u2019t understand, or say they don\\u2019t, what is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world. Let them come to Berlin. There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future. Let them come to Berlin. Stoll said that, if President Obama lived by \\u201cask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country,\\u201d his entire political platform would be invalidated.Also on the show was Dan Bongino, who authored the book\\u00a0Life Inside the Bubble. A former Secret Service Agent for President George W. Bush and currently a candidate for Congress in Maryland, Bongino fleshed out what it is like to be a secret service agent living inside the \\u201cbubble,\\u201d an alternate reality of the President and the many staffers who surround him. He offered insight as to how Kennedy\\u2019s agents were affected by the assassination. He brought to light the fact that the assassination and all the mistakes were recorded on TV for the first time. Of course, all prior presidential assassinations were during the pre-TV era.\\u00a0Joining next was Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, a\\u00a0Washington Times\\u00a0contributor and prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of Gerald Posner, author of\\u00a0Case Closed. He asserted that Oswald was the sole killer of Kennedy. Shapiro said in order to understand that Lee Harvey Oswald was the \\u201clone gunman\\u201d you have to know the man. Shapiro related that Oswald had been professionally analyzed as a schizophrenic personality and was lost in a delusional world with strong admiration for the Russian Army. It is a fact, said Shapiro, that Oswald had previously tried to kill US Major General Walker before he etched his way into American history by killing JFK. In fact, he fired a shot into Walker\\u2019s home using the same rifle he used to assassinate Kennedy.\\u00a0Most significantly, Shapiro contended that Oswald was a huge admirer of the movie\\u00a0The Manchurian Candidate,\\u00a0which tells the story of an ex-soldier who becomes an assassin and murders an American president. Oswald saw the movie several times at the same theater he escaped to after he shot Kennedy. Bannon played devil\\u2019s advocate throughout the discussion and expressed skepticism about Oswald\\u2019s marksmanship.\\u00a0Bannon also criticized the Warren commission for not being sufficiently probing in its investigation.Also contributing to the show was Breitbart News\\u2019s Jarrett Stepman, who\\u00a0asserted that there are five main culprits as focal points in JFK assassination conspiracy theories: the CIA, the Cubans, the Mafia, LBJ, and the Soviet Union\\u2019s KGB. He concluded the Soviets were the most likely to influence Oswald but stated he believes that Oswald acted alone.\\u00a0Roger Stone, Richard Nixon\\u2019s political strategist, discussed his theory that Kennedy\\u2019s Vice President and the next President of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson, was responsible for Kennedy\\u2019s assassination. In his new book,\\u00a0The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ,\\u00a0Stone accuses LBJ of being a monstrous Machiavellian who already murdered two others, including his sister, before he orchestrated the JFK assassination. LBJ was hated by other politicians and was accused of political bribery and stealing elections. Stone asserts that LBJ was the obvious beneficiary of Kennedy\\u2019s death and often \\u201cwho derives the greatest benefit\\u201d from an act of murder is often the one who commits the crime.Political guru and former Jimmy Carter strategist Pat Caddell painted broader strokes about the assassination, lamenting that the JFK killing was the seminal moment in American history when Americans began to distrust government and its institutions. Caddell contended that Americans began to feel that the Warren Commission was an effort to bamboozle the American public. Caddell feels that Kennedy was inspirational because of his ability to put forth great ideas and present them in speeches that inspired us. He lamented how political figures now offer only sound bites.Last up was Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. Bannon asked Marlow what the impact of the JFK assassination was on the millennial generation. Marlow likened that point in history to the 9/11 terror attacks as a history altering event. Marlow, 27, recounted his time studying at UC Berkeley and said that his fellow students only knew Kennedy as an icon of liberal Democrats. They failed to understand that Kennedy was a \\u201cCold Warrior,\\u201d tax-cutter, and a committed Christian in addition to holding the belief that Americans should be dedicated to doing things for our country, not the other way around.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
