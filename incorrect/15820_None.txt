"{\"title\": \"Panel spreads blame for meltdown\", \"content\": \"In its 576-page final report, the Democratic members of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission cast a wide net of blame for the meltdown that nearly sank the global banking system, castigating everyone from \\u201creckless\\u201d Wall Street titans to an \\u201cill prepared\\u201d federal government.All of the panel\\u2019s Republican members rejected the report as overly broad and issued more pointed conclusions of their own, blaming a global credit bubble and reckless actions by government sponsored mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The competing visions of what caused the financial crisis conclude the work of a commission marked since its inception in 2009 by partisan infighting, missed deadlines and charges of overspending and conflicts of interest.Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has demanded documents from the FCIC in an investigation of alleged problems.When it began, many hoped the FCIC, chaired by California Democrat Phil Angelides, would produce a report as authoritative and widely read as the one issued by the 9/11 Commission.That is not likely to be the case, according to critics of the report, which leaked out in bits and pieces throughout the week despite its official embargo of 10:00 a.m. Thursday.POLITICO obtained a full digital copy of the report on Wednesday (See: part 1, parts 2-3, part 4, part 4 cont'd, part 4 cont'd). The final report, published by Public Affairs, will be available in book stores starting today. The final report \\u201cis sort of like \\u2018Murder on the Orient Express,\\u2019 everyone is guilty,\\u201d one critic said.In its conclusions, the FCIC\\u2019s majority members wrote: \\u201cThis crisis was the result of human action and inaction, not of Mother Nature or computer models gone haywire. The captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored warnings and failed to question, understand, and manage evolving risks.\\u201dThe report criticizes the Federal Reserve\\u2019s \\u201cpivotal failure to stem the flow of toxic mortgages\\u201d and says the Securities and Exchange Commission \\u201ccould have required more capital and halted risky practices.\\u201d And it says banks \\u201cacted recklessly taking on too much risk, with too little capital, and with too much dependence on short-term funding.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 15820}"
