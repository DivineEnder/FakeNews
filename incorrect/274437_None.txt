"{\"title\": \"Iran Considers Vasectomy, Birth Control Ban; Amnesty Lashes Out\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been\\u00a0condemning\\u00a0the country\\u2019s family planning laws \\u201cas an imitation of western lifestyle\\u201d since 2013. In April 2014, parliament discussed the possibility to overturn the laws. Iran implemented birth control rules twenty years ago. These regulations include \\u201csubsidized male sterilisation surgeries and free condom distribution.\\u201d State media reported \\u201can overwhelming majority of Iranian MPs had consented to consider the bill\\u201d in a parliament controlled by conservatives.\\u201cIf we move forward like this, we will be a country of elderly people in a not too distant future,\\u201d said Khamenei in October 2013. \\u201cWhy do some [couples] prefer to have one\\u2026 or two children? Why do men or women avoid having children through different means? The reasons need to be studied\\u2026 We are not a country of 75 million, we have [the capacity] to become at least 150 million people, if not more.\\u201dAmnesty International released the report \\u201cYou Shall Procreate: Attacks on Women\\u2019s Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Iran\\u201d\\u00a0as a response and criticism to the laws. Hassiba Hadj Sahr, Amnesty International\\u2019s deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, slammed Iran in a statement:The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives\\u2026\\u201cThe bills reinforce discriminatory stereotypes of women and mark an unprecedented move by the state to interfere in people\\u2019s personal lives,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cIn their zealous quest to project an image of military might and geopolitical strength by attempting to increase birth rates, Iran\\u2019s authorities are trampling all over the fundamental rights of women \\u2013 even the marital bed is not out of bounds.\\u201dAmnesty\\u2019s report only referenced the bans on birth control, condemning the proposal as restrictive to women. In the report, Amnesty said the bill \\u201coutlaws voluntary sterilization\\u201d but fails to mention that men also fall under that category. A vasectomy is a form of voluntary sterilization, which means Iran is also violating men\\u2019s reproductive rights. At press time,\\u00a0Amnesty International\\u00a0has not responded to an inquiry regarding the vasectomy matter.\", \"article_id\": 274437}"
