Jerry Brown Begins Last Term With a Bold Energy Plan\", \"content\": \"{\\\"LOS ANGELES \\u2014  Gov.Jerry Brownbegan his fourth and final term on Monday proposing a broad reduction in California\\u2019s energy consumption over the next 15 years \\u2014 including a call to slash gas consumption by cars and trucks by as much as 50 percent \\u2014 as part of what he said would be a sweeping campaign to heighten the state\\u2019s role in the fight againstglobal warming.\\\",\\\"Mr. Brown, a longtime champion ofelectric carsand limiting greenhouse gas emissions, called in his inauguration speech for 50 percent of California\\u2019s electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2030, up from the current goal of one-third by 2020, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings.\\\",\\\"Mr. Brown was in effect proposing that California, which is already viewed as at the forefront in the battle to curb emissions, greatly expand cutbacks put in place in the state\\u2019s landmark 2006 greenhouse gas emission bills. And he made clear that he would use his final years in office to try to make this happen.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTaking significant amounts of carbon out of our economy without harming its vibrancy is exactly the sort of challenge at which California excels,\\u201d Mr. Brown, 76, said as he was sworn in. \\u201cThis is exciting, it is bold and it is absolutely necessary if we are to have any chance of stopping potentially catastrophic changes to our climate system.\\u201d\\\",\\\"His speech, delivered to a joint session of the Legislature in Sacramento, looked to the past and to the future, and brimmed with references to his family\\u2019s long history in California governance.\\\",\\\"Mr. Brown\\u2019s goals drew opposition from some Republicans, who warned that the kind of things the governor was discussing could worsen the business climate here by imposing new regulations and potentially taxes.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAt what point does being on the leading edge of environmental reform impact our ability to create jobs?\\u201d said Bob Huff, a Republican and the Senate minority leader.\\\",\\\"But the governor, a Democrat, will be working with a Legislature controlled by Democrats that has historically embraced these kinds of aggressive environmental programs. On this topic, at least, he was speaking to a friendly crowd.\\\",\\\"\\u201cCalifornia has been leading the country in building the low-carbon economy of tomorrow,\\u201d said Kevin de Le\\u00f3n, a Democrat who is president pro tem of the State Senate. \\u201cThe ambitious goals the governor stated today are admirable, but we need to make the necessary investments in advanced technology to get us there.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Indeed, Democrats, at least in their initial response to the speech, seemed more intent on trying to push Mr. Brown away from his pledge of austerity and toward restoring cuts that the state had made during a long, difficult fiscal period.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNot all Californians have come back from the recession,\\u201d said Toni G. Atkins, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly. \\u201cWe have to make sure that we are looking out for them.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Alex Jackson, the legal director for the California Climate Project with the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Mr. Brown\\u2019s goals achievable, noting that the state already seemed well on its way toward surpassing the 2020 deadline for drawing one-third of its electricity from renewable resources. \\u201cThis is a big deal,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe beacon of climate and clean energy emanates from the West.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The governor used broad brushes to describe how the state might accomplish what he acknowledged was an aggressive \\u2014 and potentially costly \\u2014 plan. Mr. Brown has repeatedly been an advocate ofelectric cars, signing legislation to support them and promoting them in a series of speeches devoted toglobal warming, and on Monday he said he saw that as one of a number of ways to achieve his goals.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI envision a wide range of initiatives: more distributed power, expanded rooftop solar, micro-grids, an energy imbalance market, battery storage, the full integration of information technology and electrical distribution, and millions of electric and low-carbon vehicles,\\u201d Mr. Brown said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAll of this is a very tall order,\\u201d he added. \\u201cHow we achieve these goals and at what pace will take great thought and imagination mixed with pragmatic caution. It will require enormous innovation, research and investment.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
