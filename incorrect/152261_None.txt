"{\"title\": \"The Friends - and Paymasters - of Alan Pyke\", \"content\": \"You remember\\u00a0Alan Pyke, don\\u2019t you? He\\u2019s the \\u201cdeputy economic policy editor\\u201d at\\u00a0Think Progress\\u2013the blog of the\\u00a0Center for American Progress, the premiere left-wing think tank in DC\\u2013who on August 14 tweeted out that he wished Roger Ailes would die a \\u201cslow, painful\\u201d death.  In other words, he\\u2019s not a very nice guy.  He does, after all, describe himself on his own Twitter page as \\u201creflexively assholish\\u201d; it\\u2019s revealing that he would a) put that self-description on his site, b) then get hired by CAP, and c) keep those words up there, even now. Pyke has since deleted that nastygram of a tweet. He also tweeted a terse \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry\\u201d\\u2013and then he went right back to tweeting. Over the last three days, he has been tweeting obsessively on the Ferguson, MO situation, sending out more than 50 tweets, cheering on the protestors, heaping scorn on the police. In other words, the usual lefty stuff. Indeed, Pyke seems to be sort of an obsessive fellow; over the last four years on Twitter,\\u00a0he has sent out nearly 55,000 tweets from his personal account. And yet interestingly, he has less than 2,000 followers. In other words, he would seem to be the very definition of a lonely, angry, man crying out in the wilderness. By contrast, Pyke\\u2019s employer, the Center for American Progress (CAP) is anything but a lonely voice. CAP is widely regarded as the most influential \\u201cprogressive\\u201d think tank in town; in particular, it is seen as a holding place for once-and-future Democratic White House aides. The current president of CAP, we might note, is Neera Tanden; she is an alumna of the Clinton White House, worked as deputy campaign manager for Hillary Clinton\\u2019s 2000 New York senatorial campaign, did a stint with Senator Clinton on Capitol Hill, then joined CAP, and then joined the Obama White House\\u2013only to return to CAP in 2013.  In other words, she\\u2019s connected.  And so she\\u2019s also connected to her employee, Alan \\u201cDeath Wish\\u201d Pyke. So what does Tanden think of Pyke now? \\u00a0And what does she think of Breitbart News\\u2019s demand that Pyke resign or be fired? We don\\u2019t know, because she\\u2019s not returning our calls,\\u00a0and there\\u2019s nothing, absolutely nothing, on the Pyke incident on the CAP website.  As far as CAP is concerned, it\\u2019s as if it never even happened.  So we can assume that Pyke\\u2019s job is safe and secure at CAP. But since what Pyke said is so outrageous, so hateful\\u2013so, well, murderous\\u2013we at Breitbart News are not going to let go.  So we will continue to check in with Tanden, to see if she has any further thoughts on Pyke. If Tanden is a well-connected woman, another CAP-er, John Podesta, is a well-connected man. Podesta is a longtime Democratic operative who served in various positions in Bill Clinton\\u2019s White House, before ascending to be Clinton\\u2019s chief of staff from 1998 to 2001. (Judicial Watch put together a useful summary of Podesta\\u2019s White House tenure, including his role in \\u201cTravelgate,\\u201d\\u00a0here.)\\u00a0In 2003, Podesta founded CAP, and built it into a powerhouse with money from George Soros, Tom Steyer, and other \\u201cprogressive\\u201d billionaires. Yet Podesta has stayed extremely close to the Clintons; in 2013,\\u00a0he was a headliner at a \\u201cReady for Hillary\\u201d event in New York City. \\u00a0Podesta is an unabashed Hillary supporter; yet even so, in December 2013, he went back to the White House, to work as President Obama\\u2019s counselor, focusing mainly on \\u201cgreen\\u201d issues, such as opposition to the Keystone Pipeline. (The fact that Green Agenda comports with the business model of CAP donors such as Steyer has not gone unnoticed.) \\u00a0Podesta has made it clear that he will be urging Obama to use mostly his executive authority; that is, don\\u2019t bother with such Constitutional niceties as legislation that must be approved by Congress. And Podesta made his own views about Congressional Republicans perfectly clear when he said that the Obama administration if facing\\u00a0\\u201ca cult worthy of Jonestown\\u201d\\u00a0in the House. Podesta apologized for those incendiary remarks, but as with Pyke, the original expression was much stronger than the subsequent retraction. Indeed, the fact that Podesta himself would say something Pyke-like tells us all we need to know about Podesta\\u2019s own worldview. After all, Pyke was hired at CAP when Podesta was president of the place; we can presume that they had a lot of contact around the office.  And even now, their tactical apologies notwithstanding, we can assume that Pyle and Podesta see the right in similar terms. So it\\u2019s a safe bet that CAP is getting no pressure from Podesta to fire, or in any way discipline, Pyke. But now, looking ahead to 2016, Tanden and Podesta are lining up behind Hillary Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign; we can expect them both to play prominent roles in the politicking, and then, if Hillary wins, in the governing.   They will bring their \\u201cprogressive\\u201d views with them\\u2013there\\u2019s no doubt about that. The only question is, will they bring Alan Pyke, too? And one more thing: There\\u2019s still the question of the donors. Such lefties as Geoge Soros and Tom Steyer have given millions, but perhaps surprisingly, corporate America has ponied up, too.  For a liberal group, CAP has done a great job of shaking money out of corporate America, as a look\\u00a0CAP\\u2019s donor list\\u00a0shows.  Are all these companies really happy with the fact that they are giving money to pay Alan Sykes\\u2019 salary?  We at Breitbart News, too, would love to know the answer. And we will do our best to find out. \\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 152261}"
