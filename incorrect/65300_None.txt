"{\"title\": \"Jamie Dimon: 'I was dead wrong'\", \"content\": \"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers Wednesday he was \\u201cdead wrong\\u201d when he initially dismissed reports of trading irregularities that ultimately ballooned into billions in losses for the bank.In April, Dimon downplayed those reports as a \\u201ctempest in a teapot.\\u201d On Wednesday, Dimon told senators that Ina Drew, the head of the chief investment office where the trading occurred, had told Dimon, who had been on the road, that this was not a significant concern.\\u201cWhen I made that statement, I was dead wrong,\\u201d Dimon told the Senate Banking Committee, where he was heckled by protesters even before the hearing began. \\u201cI was assured by them, I have the right to rely on them, that they thought this was an isolated, small issue and that it wasn\\u2019t a big problem.\\u201d( PHOTOS: JPMorgan Chase\\u2019s $2 billion loss)During nearly two hours of questioning, Dimon acknowledged to senators that the trades became \\u201csomething I cannot publicly defend\\u201d but said he did not personally approve of them. Dimon also said as punishment JPMorgan will \\u201clikely\\u201d try to recoup some of the pay and compensation from those responsible for the trading losses.In his opening remarks, Dimon had described to the committee several steps that the company took starting in December to minimize trading risks, but those moves actually made the portfolio more complicated and difficult to manage. Dimon apologized to lawmakers, saying \\u201cwe have let a lot of people down, and we are very sorry for it.\\u201d\\u201cWe will lose some of our shareholders\\u2019 money \\u2014 and for that, we feel terrible \\u2014 but no client, customer or taxpayer money was impacted by this event,\\u201d Dimon said.But aside from the early public protests, there was little in the way of fireworks. A few Democratic senators pounded Dimon but other committee members remained relatively mellow toward the bank executive.Near the end of the hearing, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) clearly agitated Dimon when the senator grilled the CEO about JPMorgan taking bailout funds during the 2008 financial crisis.Dimon quickly responded that Merkley was \\u201cmisinformed\\u201d and insisted that JPMorgan only took Trouble Asset Relief Program funds because the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve asked it to. Sounding frustrated, Dimon repeatedly interrupted Merkley as the senator tried to get in questions during his allotted five minutes.Finally, Merkley raised his finger at Dimon.\\u201dSir, this is not your hearing,\\u201d the senator said. \\u201cI\\u2019m asking you to respond to questions.\\u201dMeanwhile, speaking about the trades, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) asked Dimon: \\u201cWhat did it morph into? Russian roulette?\\u201dDimon responded: \\u201cIt morphed into something I can\\u2019t justify.\\u201d\\u201cThat is the real concern here,\\u201d Menendez said, asking Dimon what would prevent future losses that were significantly greater than the $2 billion that JPMorgan reported. Menendez continued to lash out at Dimon and his firm for lobbying against financial regulations that are the \\u201cvery types of protections [that] can guarantee that the American taxpayer doesn\\u2019t become responsible.\\u201dCORRECTION:  Corrected by: Emily Howell @ 06/14/2012 06:19 AM\\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story inaccurately reported the rank of Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider.
