"{\"article_id\": 250374, \"title\": \"Obama To Ban Fishing? Not Yet, But... Give the Regulators Time\", \"content\": \"Is the Obama administration trying to ban sport fishing? Not at this time. Is the Obama administration setting up structures and processes that could, and probably will, eventually result in more regulatory restrictions on sport fishing? You betcha. But, with all due respect to anglers, that\\u2019s not the biggest problem with the \\u201cInterim Framework For Effective Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning\\u201d issued by the Interagency Ocean Policy Taskforce (latest version dated December 9, 2009). Government goes after industry long before it dares to subtly, oh-so-subtly, impose new restrictions on individuals. The framework, which we will now shorthand as \\u201cCMSP,\\u201d will affect off-shore drilling operations, commercial fishing and commercial shipping first and foremost.Some conservative bloggers erupted in outrage when the report came to light, saying that \\u2013 as Gateway Pundit put it \\u2013 \\u201cObama\\u2019s latest assault on your rights \\u2013 he wants to ban sport fishing.\\u201d That was an overreaction, but an understandable one given the aggressive nature of this administration when it comes to environmental issues and the fact that the CMSP report specifically lists \\u201crecreational fishing\\u201d as an activity that needs to be \\u201cbetter managed\\u201d (page two of the report). Perhaps \\u201cbetter managed\\u201d translates into \\u201cleave them alone,\\u201d but one may be forgiven for thinking not.On the other end of the spectrum, George Soros\\u2019 steno pool declared that worries about a sport fishing ban were \\u201cabsurd,\\u201d as though nothing in the CMSP report could possibly have an impact on recreational fishing, even though the report itself kicked that particular door wide open. That is not to say that a ban on recreational fishing is in our immediate future, but it\\u2019s terribly na\\u00efve to believe that the CMSP framework won\\u2019t create the regulatory environment that will result in painful restrictions on the sport in the future. What does it all mean? Sit back, relax and let Dr. Environment break it down for you kids. (OK, so I don\\u2019t have an actual PhD, but seeing as how the University of Tennessee is awarding Al Gore an honorary doctorate, I\\u2019m sure that my degree just has to be in the mail).The CMSP framework is another classic, benevolent big-government gambit. It sounds great, appears to encompass everyone\\u2019s concerns and the end results of the exhaustive process proposed are supposedly the epitome of noble. Consider a few features of the program:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs part of the noble effort to protect the oceans and the Great Lakes, the Ocean Policy Taskforce will examine the effects of: commerce and transportation (i.e., shipping), commercial fishing, oil and gas exploration and development, recreational fishing and traditional hunting, fishing and gathering. Is there any real doubt about how, when the day is done, those interests will be protected as opposed to some of the other progressive causes that are listed in the taskforces plan, such as environmental conservation and renewable energy? One would have to be a fool or terribly na\\u00efve not to recognize the end game here. We\\u2019ve been down this road, many times, before.But then liberals are much better at biding their time than are conservatives. Don\\u2019t hold your breath waiting for anybody in the lazy old media to actually drill down into the issue, but the implications of this initiative are ominous. Obama\\u2019s Ocean Policy Taskforce won\\u2019t impact recreational fishing today, or even tomorrow, but it will slowly, inevitably, have just that effect as time goes by. More to the point, the task force\\u2019s mission will undercut additional segments of the free market in the name of environmental purity. Obama claims to be in favor of offshore oil and gas exploration, for example, even as his Interior Department throws obstacles in the way of the leases needed to accomplish the task. The CMSP process will help this and future progressive administrations create even more road blocks to obstruct energy companies.The real problem here is the inevitable phenomena of regulatory creep. Nobody sold the Clean Air Act to the American public as something that would increase the cost of automobiles and gasoline, but that\\u2019s what happened \\u2013 eventually. Nobody said that wetlands protection measures would mean that somebody couldn\\u2019t develop a new shopping center because muddy tire ruts in a field drained to a ditch that led to a creek that connected with a river that is part of \\u201cwaters of the United States,\\u201d but that\\u2019s what happened \\u2013 eventually. The CMSP process, on paper, is good and noble and wonderful and there\\u2019s nothing in it that directly calls for restrictions on sport fishing, but you can take this to the bank: that\\u2019s what will happen \\u2013 eventually.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
