"{\"title\": \"French Army Investigating 50 Cases Of Radicalisation Among Its Ranks\", \"content\": \"The report stated that the first step to prevent cases of radicalisation in the French army is to increase vigilance in the recruitment process. The 87 staff members of the National Defence Centre Clearances (CNHD) check through the profiles of would-be soldiers.According to General Jean-Francois Hogard, Director of Protection and Defence Security (DPSD), 92 per cent of candidates are judged not to pose a threat while eight per cent are deemed \\u201cunfavourable\\u201d. He described the CNHD as \\u201cthe first brick in combating terrorism\\u201d.The report noted that what is more difficult for the DPSD is identifying radicalisation in serving soldiers. According to General Hogard there are 50 \\u201cpriority\\u201d cases of radicalisation for the DPSD to investigate, and that this number is \\u201cconstantly evolving\\u201d.The general stated, however, that the processing of reports of extremism had to be done carefully so as not to stigmatise extremely devout Muslims. He said it \\u201cmust avoid stigmatising certain people, otherwise we risk pushing them into the arms of the enemy.\\u201cExternal signs like the [Islamic] beard, refusing to talk to women etc., you have to distinguish real cases of radicalisation and seek to limit the effects of stigma that undermine the cohesion needed by armies.\\u201dThe report said France is not the only country with concerns over radicalisation in its ranks, noting that Germany and Belgium also face this problem.In April, a military counterintelligence report claimed up to 29 former soldiers from the German army have travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight with Islamic State. Germany\\u2019s military currently has 65 open cases against suspected Islamic extremists within its ranks. The country\\u2019s defence ministry called for better screening of recruits amid fears Islamic extremists could be joining the Bundeswehr in order to get military training.In May, Belgium\\u2019s defence minister, Steven Vandeput,\\u00a0confirmed that the country\\u2019s intelligence services currently have 60 serving soldiers under surveillance. Mr Vandeput revealed in Belgium\\u2019s parliament that all \\u201chave been identified as radicalised Muslims\\u201d.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 301411}"
