"{\"title\": \"Actress Mila Kunis: Middle America Stupid for Not Loving Obama\", \"content\": \"It is always amusing to hear actors and actresses venture into the unfamiliar territory of politics when interviewers are cruel enough to broach such issues. Sadly, actress Mila Kunis is no exception to that Hollyweird tendency toward guffaw inducing political bloviating. Naturally and in keeping with most of the rest of the industry, in a new interview she\\u2019s disgorging that prosaic, ill-conceived, left-wing trope that she heard somewhere or another that serves as the basis of her \\u201copinion.\\u201d\\n\\nOf course she\\u2019s all a-gush over The One. \\u201cI love Barack Obama, I voted for him and I will forever be proud of my vote,\\u201d she is reported as saying to Britain\\u2019s Stylist magazine.Kunis, it appears, considers herself highly informed about politics and most especially on how wonderfully she thinks Obama is doing in office. Conversely, she seems blissfully unaware of the zero job growth we just experienced not to mention the highest unemployment this country has experienced since The Great Depression. She seems also completely ignorant of the trillions of dollars of debt that Obama has piled up.Still, she is sure that the compromises that she thinks Obama made in recent economic policies are going to hurt us.\\u201cI think America is in a very temperamental state, and the decision that was made and the compromises made mean, in my opinion, that people are going to pay for a very long time,\\u201d she said.Well, if she means the mess that is ObamaCare, we most certainly will be paying \\u201cfor a very long time.\\u201d But I doubt that is what she\\u2019s on about.I suppose we shouldn\\u2019t fault her too much for knowing so little about economics, though. If she\\u2019s like many actors she\\u2019s likely so far removed from even her own economic condition that she simply hasn\\u2019t the experience to understand the issues. She doesn\\u2019t have to worry about living from one paycheck \\u2014 or lack thereof \\u2014 to the next.But, darn it, the ObamaMessiah is trying so hard, dontcha know?\\n\\n\\u201cFeeling,\\u201d Miss Kunis, is not knowledge. Now, I am sure she heard, maybe even read, about how the left-wing, Old Media characterized Obama\\u2019s efforts. I am sure she saw Obama\\u2019s speeches where he mouthed the need for compromise. But it is plain she never once actually learned that none of the plans and policies that Obama and his party have offered contained any compromises. It is plain her bubble world does not allow inside the fact that the GOP is the one doing most of the compromising.One other thing she is sure about: you folks in Middle America and you young people are so ill-informed, so dang stupid that you don\\u2019t know why you are even in the Republican Party. You dummies just don\\u2019t read, she told Stylist.\\n\\nI think she is in a fantasyland, here. What \\u201ctests\\u201d is she talking about? Did she read this in a script? It sure doesn\\u2019t seem she read this from real life, anyway.Finally, she has a word or two about you uneducated religious folks.\\n\\nIf you are religious, you are uneducated? But, even her savior in D.C. claims to be religious. Is she saying he is uneducated? What contempt Kunis shows for all people of faith.For one so young she sure has come to hate an awful lot of people. Let\\u2019s hope her hatred for the very people going to her movies and helping her earn a living don\\u2019t get offended by her dismissive, hateful attitude about them, eh?\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 188301}"
