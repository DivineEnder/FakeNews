We reprint here.The\\u00a0Ku Klux Klan\\u00a0is currently\\u00a0sponsoring\\u00a0a Harrison, Ark., billboard that sends the following message: \\u201cIt\\u2019s\\u00a0not\\u00a0racist to love your people.\\u00a0www.WhitePrideRadio.com.\\u201d The message is featured next to an adorable photo of a kitten and a puppy. On the White Pride Radio website, the group further clarifies their mission: \\u201cA lot of people recognize that there is an ongoing program of genocide against white people. There are websites, newsletters, videos, and radio shows, but too many talk about family without including the family.\\u00a0It has always been our mission to not just promote the white family, but to make them a part of this cause of white Christian revival.\\u201dOddly enough, this isn\\u2019t the first time that a Harrison billboard has gone viral. Following similar signs in Alabama and Eugene, Ore., a message went up that read: \\u201cAnti-racism is code for anti-white.\\u201d If that doesn\\u2019t clear it up for you, let\\u2019s put it bluntly: White pride is always racism,\\u00a0always. Here\\u2019s why.1) Whiteness is an artificial sociological construct which has been used throughout history to exclude certain groups of people from the rights guaranteed others and to justify bigoted attitudes.As Nell Irvin Painter\\u00a0explains\\u00a0in\\u00a0The History of White People, the notion of \\u201cwhite culture\\u201d is a myth. \\u201cOur culture was founded in 1789 right about the same moment that Blumenbach was inventing Caucasians\\u2014this moment of racialization,\\u201d she told\\u00a0Salon\\u00a0in an interview from 2010. \\u201cSome people say race is in our national DNA so that we just can\\u2019t get away from it. I don\\u2019t know if we ever will.\\u201dWhile the institution of slavery made it\\u00a0difficult\\u00a0to keep accurate genealogical records for African-American families, the\\u00a0American slave trade\\u00a0sold into servitude West Africans from among the tribes of Sierra Leone, Senegambia, and the Gold Coast, as well as other areas along the coast. White Americans, however, are not a single ethnic group or a distinct number of ethnicities; they are an amalgamation of everyone who benefits from white privilege, and its boundaries are always shifting.Before the Civil War, this distinction often made the difference between whether you were a full citizen or a slave with three-fifths congressional representation; afterward, as Edward J. Blum\\u00a0discussed\\u00a0in\\u00a0Reforging the White Republic: Race, Religion, and American Nationalism, 1865-1898,\\u00a0the paradigm of \\u201cwhiteness\\u201d was used to forge a new sense of national unity for the American people as a way of healing sectional, regional, and class strife.Read the rest of the story at Salon.\", \"title\": \"Salon: White Pride Is Always Racist\", \"source_id\": 2}"
