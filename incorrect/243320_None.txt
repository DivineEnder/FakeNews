"{\"title\": \"Khamenei's New Book 'Palestine': A Guide to Iran's True Intentions\", \"article_id\": 243320, \"content\": \"While Senator Barbara Mikulski\\u2019s\\u00a0announcement she will support the Iranian nuclear deal seems to give President Obama the crucial 34th\\u00a0vote he needs to ensure its survival, all members of Congress may want to read the English-language excerpts available of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\\u2019s recently published book Palestine\\u00a0before casting their final vote.The fact Khamenei has no reservations about publishing this book\\u2014clearly stating what lies ahead for Israel and the U.S.\\u2014before Congress has even voted on the agreement is most telling. He appears to believe\\u00a0Tehran\\u2019s destiny is sealed by Allah\\u2019s double blessing: its enemy, \\u201cthe Great Satan,\\u201d is led not only by an incompetent U.S. president but an incompetent Congress as well.Khamenei\\u2019s book is simply titled Palestine, but it goes beyond the issue the title suggests. According to the excerpts in English now available, the book not only makes clear the Palestinian people are to be returned to the land Israel now holds\\u2014a goal to be accomplished by that nation\\u2019s destruction\\u2014but it also mandates America\\u2019s destruction. President Obama may tell us the mullahs\\u2019 calls for \\u201cDeath to America\\u201d are for domestic consumption only,\\u00a0but the book tells us Khamenei is a man with a plan to make the chant a reality.For Khamenei, the adage \\u201cpossession is nine-tenths of the law\\u201d lacks relevance in regards to Palestine as lands once occupied by Muslims can never be conceded to non-believers currently occupying them. He writes that fatwas issued decades ago obligate all Muslim countries to eradicate Israel in an effort to return that territory to the Palestinians.Khamenei credits his predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, for spurring on the \\u201cIslamic awakening\\u201d\\u2014the first focus of which was to replace the Shah with an Islamic republic; the second to wage war against Israel to emancipate Palestine.But, Khamenei adds, the Islamic awakening also has a global mission\\u2014to confront the U.S. as the symbol of injustice in the world, \\u201ccutting the hand of the United States from Islamic countries, establishing Islamic government and restoring Islamic values, and emancipating the whole of Palestine are our objectives.\\u201dKhamenei advises Iranians need prepare for what lies ahead, improving the quality of their weapons (nuclear?) to accomplish what needs to be done.The timing of Khamenei\\u2019s brazen declaration to destroy Israel and the U.S. suggests he truly believes Allah has paved the way for an Islamic miracle to occur.Khamenei\\u2019s book makes clear as long as the mullahs are in power, a two-state solution will never happen. There is but one solution and that is forcefully divesting Israel of the land the Jews occupy. With Iran now to receive $150 billion\\u2014courtesy of Kerry, whose first priority as Secretary of State was negotiating a two-state solution\\u2014Khamenei undoubtedly is ecstatic he will possess the financial fuel to achieve his one state solution.One can understand from Khamenei\\u2019s book why Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has voiced his concerns about the nuclear deal\\u2014as the Supreme Leader\\u2019s foreign policy is being driven by his absolute commitment to Israel\\u2019s destruction. When those billions of dollars in assets are released, the mullahs will go to work using their new found wealth to arm to the teeth every Islamic terrorist group it can to wipe Israel off the map.A statement Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made in October 2005 created controversy when he allegedly threatened to \\u201cwipe Israel off the map.\\u201d Pro-Iran defenders suggested afterward the statement was taken out of context. But if that is so, it is interesting that Khamenei chose to give the statement new life in his book.Khamenei could not be clearer in noting, \\u201cThe land of Palestine has to be freed and returned to its own people. They might ask, \\u2018How would you wipe a country, which is under the protection of the superpowers, off the map?\\u2019 A resolve that comes from faith eases any difficulty; it makes every miracle possible.\\u201dIf Congress approves the Iranian nuclear deal, for Khamenei that \\u201cmiracle\\u201d will come in the form of a nuclear warhead.Lt. Colonel James G. Zumwalt, USMC (Ret.), is a retired Marine infantry officer who served in the Vietnam war, the U.S. invasion of Panama and the first Gulf war. He is the author of \\u201cBare Feet, Iron Will\\u2013Stories from the Other Side of Vietnam\\u2019s Battlefields,\\u201d \\u201cLiving the Juche Lie: North Korea\\u2019s Kim Dynasty\\u201d and \\u201cDoomsday: Iran\\u2013The Clock is Ticking.\\u201d He frequently writes on foreign policy and defense issues.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
