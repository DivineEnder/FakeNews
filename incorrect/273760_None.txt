"{\"title\": \"Capsized Boat Survivor: Smugglers Locked Hundreds of Immigrants in Hold\", \"content\": \"Italian prosecutors said a Bangladeshi survivor flown to Sicily for treatment told them 950 people were aboard, including hundreds who had been locked in the hold by smugglers. Earlier, authorities said a survivor told them 700 migrants were on board.It wasn\\u2019t immediately clear if they were referring to the same survivor, and Premier Matteo Renzi said Italian authorities were \\u201cnot in a position to confirm or verify\\u201d the death toll.Eighteen ships joined the rescue effort, but only 28 survivors and 24 bodies were pulled from the water by nightfall, Renzi said.These small numbers make more sense if hundreds of people were locked in the hold, because with so much weight down below, \\u201csurely the boat would have sunk,\\u201d said Gen. Antonino Iraso, of the Italian Border Police, which has deployed boats in the operation.Prosecutor Giovanni Salvi told The Associated Press by phone from the city of Catania that a survivor from Bangladesh described the situation on the fishing boat to prosecutors who interviewed him in a hospital. The man said about 300 people were in the hold when the fishing boat overturned, and that about 200 women and dozens of children also were on board.Salvi stressed that there was no confirmation yet of the man\\u2019s account and that the investigation was ongoing.Iraso said the sea in the area is too deep for divers, suggesting that the final toll may never be known. The sea off Libya runs as deep as 3 miles (5 kilometers) or more.`\\u2019How can it be that we daily are witnessing a tragedy?\\u201d asked Renzi, who strategized with his top ministers ahead of Monday\\u2019s European Union meeting in Luxembourg, where foreign ministers scrambled to add stopping the smugglers to their agenda.Resurgent right-wing political parties have made a rallying cry out of a rising tide of illegal migration. So far this year, 35,000 asylum seekers and migrants have reached Europe and more than 900 are known to have died trying.With Sunday\\u2019s tragedy, demands for decisive action were going mainstream, as authorities from France, Spain, Germany and Britain joined calls for a unified response.`\\u2019Europe can do more and Europe must do more,\\u201d said Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament. `\\u2019It is a shame and a confession of failure how many countries run away from responsibility and how little money we provide for rescue missions.\\u201dEurope must mobilize `\\u2019more ships, more overflights by aircraft,\\u201d French President Francois Hollande told French TV Canal + on Sunday. \\u201cWords won\\u2019t do anymore,\\u201d Spain\\u2019s Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, told a political rally.Renzi said he too wants action, but he rejected calls by some Italian lawmakers for a naval blockade. That would only `\\u2019wind up helping the smugglers\\u201d since military ships would be there to rescue any migrants, and they wouldn\\u2019t be able to return passengers to chaos and violence in Libya.Meanwhile Sunday, rescuers were `\\u2019checking who is alive and who is dead\\u201d in an area littered with debris and oil from the capsized ship. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, whose island nation joined the effort, said only 50 survived, and called it the `\\u2019biggest human tragedy of the last few years.\\u201dThe 20-meter (66-foot) vessel may have overturned because migrants rushed to one side of the craft late Saturday night when they saw an approaching Portuguese-flagged container ship, the King Jacob, which was sent to the area by Italy\\u2019s Coast Guard. The ship\\u2019s crew \\u201cimmediately deployed rescue boats, gangway, nets and life rings,\\u201d a spokesman for its owner said.Asked whether migrants rushed to one side as the Portuguese vessel pulled close, Iraso told Sky TG24 TV that `\\u2019the dynamics aren\\u2019t clear. But this is not the first time that has happened.\\u201dRenzi praised the container ship for quickly responding on what would become its fifth recent rescue operation.\\u201cSince the waters of the Mediterranean Sea are not too cold at the moment, the authorities hope to find more survivors,\\u201d said International Organization for Migration spokesman Joel Millman.United Nations refugee agency spokeswoman Carlotta Sami tweeted that according to one survivor, the boat had set out with 700 migrants aboard. When it overturned, `\\u2019the people ended up in the water, with the boat on top of them,\\u201d Sami told Italian state TV.`\\u2019There are fears there could be hundreds of dead,\\u201d Pope Francis said in St. Peter\\u2019s Square, lending his moral authority to the political calls for action by urging `\\u2019the international community to act decisively and promptly, to prevent similar tragedies from occurring again.\\u201dDesperate migrants fleeing war, persecution and conflict in Africa, the Middle East and Asia have long tried to reach Europe. Libya has increasingly become a more frequent point of departure in the years since rival militias, tribal factions and other political forces destabilized the country following the bloody end of Moammar Gadhafi\\u2019s dictatorship.Malta and Italy are closest to the Libyan coast, and have received the brunt of a migrant tide that carried 219,000 people from Africa to Europe last year. Some 3,500 are known to have died along the way, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in a statement Sunday.In Italy\\u2019s Parliament, the leaders of foreign affairs and defense commissions pushed for the EU and the UN to prepare a naval blockade of Libya\\u2019s coast. Without one, \\u201cthe traffickers will continue to operate and make money and the wretched will continue to die,\\u201d said Pier Fernando Casini, the Senate foreign affairs commission president.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 273760}"
