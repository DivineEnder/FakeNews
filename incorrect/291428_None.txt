"{\"title\": \"New York Daily News: Ban 'God Bless America' from Ball Games\", \"content\": \"\\u201cWelcome to the July 4 holiday weekend \\u2014 when once again, baseball fans will be assaulted by the saccharine-sweet non-anthem \\u2018God Bless America\\u2019 at stadia all over this great land,\\u201d Kuntzman\\u00a0began in his off-colored column.Kuntzman says he was initially thankful for Major League Baseball\\u2019s decision to play the pro-America anthem after the Islamic terror attacks on September 11, 2001., but says eventually, the \\u201cshared\\u00a0heartache\\u201d of 9/11 that \\u201cprovided catharsis\\u201d soon \\u201cbecame headache.\\u201d\\u201cThe Yankees still play it at every game, but most teams, like my beloved Mets, play \\u201cGod Bless America\\u201d only on Sundays or holidays, Kuntzman wrote, adding, \\u201cbut even that\\u2019s too much.\\u201dKuntzman says\\u00a0the reverential tradition \\u201cwhen fans are asked to rise, remove their caps and place them over their hearts\\u201d is a \\u201cMussolini-esque\\u00a0introduction of the song.\\u201d\\u201cReality check, friends: \\u2018God Bless America\\u2019 is not the National Anthem,\\u201d Kuntzman spews. \\u201cThe only songs Americans should stand for are \\u2018The Star Spangled Banner\\u2019 and \\u2018Here Comes the Bride.'\\u201dThe song, originally written by\\u00a0Irving Berlin in 1918, Kuntzman\\u00a0says, has become \\u201cas much a symbol of post-war patriotism as the flag, the space program and all the white people moving to the suburbs.\\u201d\\u201cThe song still embodies great things about America, but also our worst things: self-righteousness, forced piety, earnest self-reverence, foam,\\u201d Kuntzman\\u00a0wrote.Kuntzman also casts \\u201cGod Bless America\\u201d as offensive to believers, foreigners, and folk singer Woody Guthrie.\\u201cSo this July 4, join me at the Church of Baseball by not rising and not doffing your cap for a song that is not the national anthem of a nation that is not uniquely blessed by some deity that doesn\\u2019t exist anyway,\\u201d Kuntzman pleads.\\u201cIf you want to thank God for blessing America, you can do it on Sunday in the other church.\\u201dKuntzman took to Twitter and posted a link to his article, writing \\u201cFirst guns, now I take on god: Baseball must permanently retire \\u2018God Bless America.'\\u201dFirst guns, now I take on god: Baseball must permanently retire \\u2018God Bless America' https://t.co/QJbaS7ZZKb pic.twitter.com/zfqIuXL7fY\\u2014 Gersh Kuntzman (@GershKuntzman) June 30, 2016Follow\\u00a0Jerome Hudson\\u00a0on Twitter:\\u00a0@jeromeehudson.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 291428}"
