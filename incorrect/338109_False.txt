Over Proposed Program Cuts\", \"content\": \"{\\\"CLEVELAND \\u2014President Obamaon Wednesday denounced the Republicans\\u2019 latest budget as stingy and shortsighted, taking them to task for proposing to cut domestic programs that he said would yield more jobs and economic benefits for working people who are struggling financially.\\\",\\\"During an appearance here, Mr. Obama announced new initiatives \\u2014 including about $230 million in federal money \\u2014 to aid American manufacturers, and he argued that the Republican plan would set back the nation\\u2019s economic recovery and hurt workers who have not yet had the chance to profit from it.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe budget that they\\u2019re putting forward and the theories they\\u2019re putting forward are a path to prosperity for those who have already prospered,\\u201d Mr. Obama said in a harsh assessment of Republicans\\u2019 economic vision. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a story of retreat.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In a 36-minute speech to theCity Club of Clevelandthat credited his own policies for the economy\\u2019s comeback, the president cast Republicans as naysayers clinging to the idea of tax cuts for the wealthy financed by slashing programs for everyone else. He said that they were \\u201cdoubling down on trickle-down\\u201d economics while pretending to care about the middle class.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf they believe it\\u2019s time to end the social contract that sustains so many of us, the basic bargain of shared sacrifice and shared responsibility, own it and make the argument, but you can\\u2019t credibly claim that this vision is about helping working families get ahead,\\u201d he told an audience of about 450.\\\",\\\"The trip was an example of how Mr. Obama is trying to compensate for his lack of clout in the Republican-held Congress by using the trappings of the presidency outside Washington. He is hoping to build public support for his domestic agenda in an attempt to pressure Republicans to compromise with him.\\\",\\\"But the tactic has not proved successful so far, and on Wednesday, Republicans criticized Mr. Obama for attacking them rather than pushing bipartisan priorities like loosening restrictions on international trade andbolstering cybersecurity laws\\u2014 agenda items where Democrats are his most troublesome adversaries.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf President Obama was serious about expanding growth and opportunity, he\\u2019d be working with Republicans on areas of common ground,\\u201d said Cory Fritz, a spokesman for John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House. \\u201cToday\\u2019s stop in Cleveland was nothing more than a political stunt designed to double down on the same tax-and-spend policies that have failed middle-class families.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama\\u2019s speech amounted to an I-told-you-so defense of his policies, in which he shot down Republicans\\u2019 harshest claims and predictions about his agenda \\u2014 including warnings of job losses, stock market drops, $6.60 per gallon gas and trillion-dollar deficits.\\\",\\\"He even referred to Mr. Boehner\\u2019s \\u201cWhere are the jobs?\\u201d campaign mantra.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWell, after 12 million new jobs, a stock market that\\u2019s more than doubled, deficits that have been cut by two-thirds, health care inflation at the lowest rate in nearly 50 years, manufacturing coming back, auto industry coming back, clean energy doubled, I\\u2019ve come not only to answer that question, but I want to return to the debate that is central to this country and the alternative economic theory that\\u2019s presented by the other side,\\u201d Mr. Obama said.\\\",\\\"Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the visit raised questions about when Mr. Obama \\u201cis going to get off the campaign trail and start trying to get things done.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cImagine if he was going there to push for his trade agenda, or any of the other items on his agenda that are being slowed by Democrats,\\u201d Mr. Stewart said.\\\",\\\"Indeed, Mr. Obama\\u2019s stop in Cleveland, a city in the Rust Belt where skepticism about international trade agreements runs high, underscored the political squeeze facing the president as he pushes to accomplish major elements of his agenda during his final two years in office. Republicans have shown little interest in forging compromises with Mr. Obama on domestic initiatives that animate his party\\u2019s core supporters, like free community college, subsidies for child care and paid leave, while Democrats are reluctant to back him on his bid for new trade deals.\\\",\\\"The budget debate unfolding in Washington this week dramatizes Mr. Obama\\u2019s rift with Republicans. They are advocating holding to strict spending caps that would force deep cuts in national security and social programs, while the president wants to lift the limits in both areas by a total of about $75 billion.\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama\\u2019s speech highlighted the differences between him and most Republicans.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt was one thing for them to argue against Obamacare before it was put in place,\\u201d Mr. Obama said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s working even better than I expected, but it doesn\\u2019t matter \\u2014 evidence be damned \\u2014 it\\u2019s still \\u2018a disaster.\\u2019 Well, why?\\u201d\\\",\\\"At the same time, during a nearly 45-minute question-and-answer session after his speech, Mr. Obama criticized the political division that he said prevented like-minded Republicans from teaming with him even on basic things like funding the government or devoting federal money to building roads and bridges, an area in which Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he believes there is room for a bipartisan deal.\\\",\\\"\\u201cConstant campaigning and the polarization of the bases and the inability, it seems, to just agree on a core set of facts means even when some of our Republican friends want to work with us, it\\u2019s hard to do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey are worried that they\\u2019ll get attacked, or they\\u2019ll be viewed as compromisers, or they\\u2019ll get a primary challenge by somebody further to the right.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
