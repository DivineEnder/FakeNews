"{\"article_id\": 238809, \"content\": \"Bolton later said that while he hasn\\u2019t seen the material, \\u201cthere\\u2019s no question that the twenty-eight pages should be released,\\u201d also adding that he \\u201cflat-out\\u201d doesn\\u2019t believe the Bush administration would have covered up a Saudi attack on the United States. Said Bolton,\\u00a0\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what they contain. I haven\\u2019t read them. There are those who say that it will demonstrate involvement by the Saudi government in the 9-11 attacks and I think that\\u2019s obviously a pretty critical piece of information. Release the pages, assuming there\\u2019s not information that compromises our intelligence sources and methods and let the people decide.\\u201dOn\\u00a0the notions of lawsuits and the concept of sovereign immunity, said Bolton:Only in America\\u2019s over-lawyered society can people think that the answer, if there was Saudi involvement, is to sue them. I think that\\u2019s why we need to look at the ramifications of this kind of law elsewhere in the world. Sovereign immunity is a difficult doctrine to understand. It seems to protect wrongdoing. It actually is more of a shield for the United States. Can you imagine in the conspiracy-minded societies in different regions of the world, or the anti-American feeling let\\u2019s say in some quarters in europe, that if their governments removed sovereign immunity for the United States the kind of lawsuits that would be brought about us.Bolton argued for transparency but also seemed to call for caution against a rush to judgment, saying:It\\u2019s important to get the 28 pages released and if they turn out to be as devastating as people say, then let\\u2019s take a look at what needs to be done. On the other hand, if it turns out it\\u2019s a lot of hype and speculation and rumor and innuendo and so on, then let\\u2019s think back to the Bush administration, which heard all these allegations, read the 28 pages and concluded that the Saudi government was not involved in 9-11. Now, this is the George W. Bush that his opponents are attacking for invading this country, invading that country, why would he cover up for Saudi Arabia? I understand what people think of Obama, they think he\\u2019s capable of anything. Do you really think George W. Bush covered up a Saudi attack on the United States? I don\\u2019t believe it. I\\u2019ll just say it flat-out. I don\\u2019t believe that\\u2019s what the administration did.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.
