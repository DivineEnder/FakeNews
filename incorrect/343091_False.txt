"{\"title\": \"In New Hampshire, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie Add Guilt Trips to Campaign Stops\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 343091, \"content\": \"{\\\"PETERBOROUGH, N.H. \\u2014  The two leading Republican candidates not namedDonald J. Trumpwho most need a victory in the New Hampshire primary have wooed voters here by promoting their experience, their tough-mindedness and their seriousness.\\\",\\\"Now, asGov. Chris Christieof New Jersey andJeb Bushgrasp for some way to dissuade the proud New Hampshire electorate from supporting Mr. Trump, they are turning to a new, blunter instrument: guilt.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAmerica is counting on you,\\u201d Mr. Christie said Sunday night in the century-old town hall here, his 40th question-and-answer session in the state. He repeated himself a few sentences later, in case the voters had missed the barely veiled warning.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere\\u2019s 14 of us today,\\u201d Mr. Christie said of the Republican field. \\u201cYou all will take us from 14 to four or five. And those four or five are the only ones Americans are going to have to choose from other than Hillary Rodham Clinton. You have enormous responsibility.\\u201d\\\",\\\"On Monday night, speaking at the Christmas-bedecked American Legion hall in Alton, Mr. Bush picked up where Mr. Christie left off.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNew Hampshire has a special place in our democracy,\\u201d Mr. Bush said at his 27th town-hall-style meeting, alluding to its tradition of holding the first primaries, shortly after Iowa\\u2019s caucuses. \\u201cI, for one, will entrust the voters of New Hampshire to make this decision disproportionately more than any other place. I\\u2019m totally confident that you all will maintain your position as first in the nation, that you will be discerning about this.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Drenching New Hampshire voters with praise has long been a staple of campaigns for the White House, with candidates holding up the image of civic-minded voters as paragons of democracy in hopes that some of it will pay off on Election Day.\\\",\\\"But in an unusual campaign in which the leading candidate lacks either of the qualities New Hampshire voters are said to demand \\u2014 a command of policy details and commitment to one-on-one campaigning \\u2014 his rivals are repurposing their paeans to play on the vanity and insecurities of the New Hampshire political-industrial complex.\\\",\\\"The don\\u2019t-screw-this-up pleadings to honor what many here see as their civic birthright reflect how anxious Mr. Bush and Mr. Christie are to find some way to bring down Mr. Trump, who leads his nearest competitor in New Hampshire by double digits in polls.\\\",\\\"There is a dash of Tony Soprano \\u2014 nice little primary franchise you got there, be a shame if something happened to it \\u2014 and a heap of Jewish mother. Or, perhaps, Italian mother.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAre you trying to imply that an Italian from New Jersey would use guilt?\\u201d Mr. Christie said with faux incredulity in an interview on Monday aboard his bus in Nashua. \\u201cI think what I\\u2019m saying to them is, it would be a shame for the country if New Hampshire makes the wrong choices. Guilt was a frequently used weapon of my mother. So some of it just comes out naturally.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But Mr. Christie did not deny that he was in effect telling New Hampshire voters not to send their reputation for discriminating tastes in candidates down the drain.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s exactly what I\\u2019m saying,\\u201d he said, again invoking how much the \\u201ccountry is counting on them\\u201d and noting their \\u201chuge responsibility.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Bush can be just as blunt. Asked Saturday in Exeter how he planned to beat Mr. Trump, he aimed straight at Granite State privilege.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou\\u2019re the answer,\\u201d said Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, to the attendees. \\u201cThe question is will New Hampshire want to support a guy who might tarnish this extraordinary reputation that you have, which is first-in-nation status, where you make people walk through the hot coals each and every time they come, where you challenge people, where you help them learn how to get better at doing this.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNew Hampshire is an extraordinary part of this process and I don\\u2019t thinkDonald Trump\\u2019s going to survive New Hampshire to be honest with you, because I have too much confidence in you all.\\u201d\\\",\\\"There are differences in the subtle shaming Mr. Bush and Mr. Christie employ. Mr. Bush is far more explicit about targeting Mr. Trump, while Mr. Christie, who would like to win some Trump voters, tends not to mention him directly. (\\u201cI\\u2019m not as judgmental about it as Jeb is,\\u201d Mr. Christie said.)\\\",\\\"Some of the state\\u2019s political pillars speak just as assuredly of Mr. Trump\\u2019s inevitable fall. This is partly a verse in the same hymnal from which Mr. Bush and Mr. Christie are reading.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to throw away their vote,\\u201d predicted former Senator Judd Gregg, whose father was governor of New Hampshire and literallywrote the book on the state\\u2019s primary.\\\",\\\"Dismissing the polls showing Mr. Trump leading, Mr. Gregg, a Bush supporter, even said, \\u201cI\\u2019m willing to bet on Trump not winning here.\\u201d\\\",\\\"With renewed chatter from national party figures about whether Iowa and New Hampshire should be allowed to retain their first-to-vote privileges, the prospect of Mr. Trump\\u2019s winning here, and doing so without doing the sort of policy-heavy, on-the-ground campaigning the state prides itself on, is unnerving for leaders in both parties.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere will be people who say, \\u2018See, that\\u2019s why New Hampshire shouldn\\u2019t have the first primary,\\u2019\\u201d said Terry Shumaker, a longtime Democratic leader in the state, of how critics would seize on a Trump win. \\u201cIt will be used.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In Peterborough, though, Mr. Christie said it did not have to come to that. He recalled a New Hampshire voter he had encountered who complained of being powerless over a turbulent election.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI looked at him, I said, \\u2018Stop it, powerless,\\u2019\\u00a0\\u201d Mr. Christie recounted, all but spitting out any suggestion of impotence. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a voter in New Hampshire. You\\u2019re among the most powerful people in the world right now.\\u201d\\\"}\"}"
