"{\"title\": \"Tourists Find Human Foot at Rio's Copacabana, Site of Olympic Beach Volleyball\", \"content\": \"Reuters reports that a street vendor first alerted the media to the discovery in the beach. Extra, a Brazilian outlet\\u00a0linked to the Globo newspaper\\u00a0claiming to have had contact with the vendor through Whatsapp, reported that many in the area were stunned by the discovery, questioning whether it was part of a prank. Few facts are available about the body parts;\\u00a0police merely confirmed the discovery to Reuters. CNN describes the parts as a \\u201cdismembered foot and another body part still unidentified,\\u201d believed to have belonged to a \\u201cwoman or young adult.\\u201dPolice Lt. Col. Sergio Murilo Miranda Angelotti told Extra that the foot is in such a state of decomposition that finding any further information will prove a challenge. \\u201cIt may have come from anywhere,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt is very strange, because it is not a full dismembered body, only one foot. \\u2026 It may have even been a drowned body that has decomposed.\\u201dCopacabana, one of the cleanest bodies of water in Rio de Janeiro, is scheduled to host the Summer Olympics beach volleyball tournament in August. Olympic organizers have continued to campaign to attract tourists for the event following the discovery of the foot. The beach will be one of a number of seaside venues hosting events, among them Lagoa, the lagoon area reserved for rowing, and Guanabara Bay, a body of water so polluted locals refer to it as \\u201cthe latrine.\\u201dGuanabara Bay will host Olympic swimming, and those practicing in it have already suffered rashes and bouts of vomiting when coming into contact with the water. One sailboat capsized after running into a wayward sofa floating in the water. The\\u00a0Daily Mail, reporting on-site, adds human waste from a local hospital, feces and other waste dumped out of homes by locals, \\u201cunwanted meat and chicken parts,\\u201d and used bottles and cans to the list of refuse floating in the bay.The abundance of recyclable materials like cans and bottles attracts local impoverished children; those who reject a life of selling drugs swim in Guanabara looking for material they can recycle and sell for petty cash. \\u201cWe found young boys excitedly wading, rowing \\u2013 and even swimming \\u2013 into the putrid waters to collect plastic bags and bottles, aluminium [sic] cans, copper wires, and any other items which could later be sold or recycled,\\u201d the\\u00a0Daily Mail\\u00a0notes.The less objectionable water venues in Rio de Janeiro are nonetheless toxic. A study released earlier this month found that waters off numerous beaches, including Copacabana, and Flamengo Beach, a sailing venue, tested positive for a \\u201csuper bacteria\\u201d Reuters describes as typically only existing within hospital confines. The bacteria are referred to as \\u201csuper\\u201d because of their resistance to antibiotics, making recovery more difficult for those infected.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 296897}"
