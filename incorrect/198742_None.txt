"{\"article_id\": 198742, \"title\": \"Poll: Grassroots Conservatives Want Congress to Secure The Border\", \"content\": \"As Congress prepares to return from summer recess this week, my organization, Citizens United, conducted a poll of a cross-section of our national membership asking what issue lawmakers on Capitol Hill should focus on next.\\u00a0 We followed that query up with a question regarding congressional term limits.\\u00a0 The results of the poll should be both a roadmap and a warning sign for House and Senate leadership as they plot their upcoming strategies for the fall.First we asked: \\u201cChoosing from the list of ten issues, what is the one issue you would like Congress to address next?\\u201d\\u00a0 Of the wide-ranging issues provided, a commanding 31 percent of the 4,100 individuals polled voted for border security as the issue Congress should tackle first upon their return to Washington. Defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing and replacing Obamacare were next on our grassroots conservatives\\u2019 priority list, at 16 percent and 15 percent respectively.\\u00a0 Passing a Balanced Budget Amendment garnered 12 percent of the vote, with eight\\u00a0percent saying Congress should vote to declare war on ISIS.\\u00a0 Rounding out the poll was tax code reform at five\\u00a0percent, entitlement reform at two percent, opening up domestic energy production at two\\u00a0percent, tax relief at one\\u00a0percent, and education reform at less than one percent. \\u00a0Eight percent of those polled chose \\u201cother.\\u201dThe fact that one of the ten issues received almost a third of our member vote is astounding. The dominance of illegal immigration and the dire situation at the southern border was fueled of course by the anti-establishment, anti-Washington, anti-politician candidacy of Donald Trump.\\u00a0 Trump\\u2019s candid and tough talk about building a border wall has lit a fire across America that is still burning brightly. \\u00a0Is Congress listening?\\u00a0 This critical point \\u2014 whether or not our elected leaders on Capitol Hill listen to their constituents anymore \\u2014\\u00a0is directly tied to the next question in our poll.We asked our members: \\u201cDo you support amending the U.S. Constitution to require term limits for Members of Congress?\\u201d\\u00a0 A resounding 85 percent of those surveyed support congressional term limits, five\\u00a0percent were against, and the balance \\u201cnot sure.\\u201d \\u00a0Similarly, a 2013 public poll on the subject revealed that 75 percent supported term limits at the time.\\u00a0 There\\u2019s no doubt about it, an enormous percentage of Americans think that entrenched, out-of-touch career politicians are a problem that needs to be dealt with.\\u00a0 What would happen if Mr. Trump lit the fire for term limits like he\\u2019s done with border security?There will be a flurry of activity in Congress in September, with many consequential decisions needing to be made in the areas of federal spending and national security.\\u00a0 We\\u2019ll also find out if Republican leaders in Congress have the courage to finally defund Planned Parenthood and keep the expired Export-Import Bank from coming back.\\u00a0 One thing\\u2019s for sure, grassroots conservatives want Republicans in Congress to stand up for what they say they believe in, and pass the agenda that was promised before the past three national elections.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
