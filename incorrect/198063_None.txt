Hillary Clinton Campaign, Super PAC Deliver Identical Email Talking Point\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Though political campaigns are barred from directly coordinating with Super PAC\\u2019s under Federal Election Commission (FEC) law, the Clinton campaign is apparently flouting those rules.Here\\u2019s what\\u00a0Clinton campaign senior adviser and spokeswoman Karen Finney had to say Sunday after Hillary\\u2019s interview on \\u201cMeet The Press.\\u201dQuestions on @HillaryClinton\\u2018s emails on this morning\\u2019s #MTP? Asked and answered. Time to move on.\\u2014 Karen Finney (@finneyk) September 27, 2015What an original thought! Oh wait, here\\u2019s the head of the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record, Brad Woodhouse, just minutes later: \\u00a0\\nQuestions on @HillaryClinton\\u2018s emails on this morning\\u2019s #MTP? Asked and answered. Time to move on.\\u2014 Brad Woodhouse (@woodhouseb) September 27, 2015\\nThe Clinton campaign recently claimed that it can coordinate somewhat, within the law, with Correct the Record when it comes to Internet postings. The Clinton camp thinks that it can comment on Correct the Record\\u2019s online content, such as its videos, without being guilty of illegal coordination. But the FEC has still yet to confirm that. And can the campaign and the super PAC literally use the same exact talking point, seemingly copied and pasted from one Twitter account to another?Correct The Record describes itself as \\u201ca strategic research and rapid response team designed to defend Hillary Clinton from baseless attacks.\\u201dDespite the Clinton camp\\u2019s apparent belief that the email scandal is over following Clinton\\u2019s appearance on a Sunday talk show, FBI investigators recently extracted never-before-seen emails from Clinton\\u2019s private server. The email scandal continues apace.\"}"
