"{\"title\": \"New Book Ties Woody Harrelson's Father to Unsolved 1968 Murder\", \"content\": \"Texas trial lawyer David Berg\\u2019s Run, Brother, Run includes evidence pinning his brother\\u2019s murder in 1968 on Charles Harrelson.According to the book, Harrelson\\u2019s girlfriend, Sandra Sue Attaway, lured [Alan] Berg to the Brass Jar, a Houston bar. Harrelson forced Berg into the car with a gun and told Attaway to drive to a remote location. There, he got out and shot Berg in the temple. Harrelson reportedly strangled Berg after the gunshot failed to kill him.Harrelson, 32, was acquitted of Berg\\u2019s murder during a 1970 trial, but the victim\\u2019s family has uncovered new documents \\u2014 among them evidence that Harrelson\\u2019s alibi was bogus, statements from a witness whom Harrelson confessed to, and interviews with Attaway outlining each step of the crime \\u2014 that they say prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Harrelson was the killer.The actor retains a close bond with his late father, going so far as to say he didn\\u2019t deserve his prison fate.How do I feel about him? Well I love him. I definitely love him. Very fond of him. I mean, there\\u2019s probably a lot of people who should be behind bars. I don\\u2019t necessarily think he\\u2019s one of them,\\u201d Woody said in a TV interview before his father\\u2019s death.\\n\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 126254}"
