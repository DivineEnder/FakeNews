Michael Flynn: Trump Willing to Take a \\u2018Bag of You-Know-What\\u2019 from Obama and Clinton Because He \\u2018Believes Deeply in the Future of America\\u2019\", \"content\": \"Flynn explained:Number One, he\\u2019s very serious about this country. He\\u2019s a huge patriot. He loves this country. He has a family, and he\\u2019s got children, and he wants to see their lives and the kind of country he was raised in where there\\u2019s enormous opportunity.So for those in the inner city \\u2014 you know, the Hispanic-American community, the African-American community \\u2014 I grew up in a community of sort of lower-middle-class. My father was a sergeant in the Army. He got out and he became a teller in a bank with nine children. I\\u2019m one of nine kids. We were taught to work hard. If you work hard; you can do great things. That was sort of the Democratic principles at that time.Now we have this dependency. We have got to lift this lid of dependency off of America, particularly the American inner cities, and rebuild what it is that we know we can do. We need to have this. We will not last as a country if we do not lift off this lid of dependency on the federal government that the progressive movement, the current Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, and the ilk around her want to basically put us under. We cannot have that.Donald Trump, again, he represents a new leader that our country needs. And boy, I\\u2019ll tell you what, the world needs him too because the world\\u2019s a mess.And he knows. The one thing that Donald Trump knows is, he knows he is going to take on, he\\u2019s going to be given a bag of you-know-what by this current Administration, and that included four years of Hillary Clinton as the Secretary of State, with just leaving a mess around the world in all sorts of places, from the Asia-Pacific theater to the Eastern European theater of operations where Russia\\u2019s dominating, to the Middle East and North Africa, which is just a total disaster.Donald Trump knows this. He is taking this on because he believes deeply in the future of America. One of the big ways he\\u2019s doing it, I believe, and one of the strengths of Donald Trump is his ability to get our country\\u2019s economic engines going again, which we must have.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\\u00a0Eastern.LISTEN:\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 310627}"
