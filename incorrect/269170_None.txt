"{\"content\": \"The horrific disaster in Japan is no excuse for horrible reporting.In fact, we need accurate reporting now more than ever to tell us exactly what is going on in the wake of this awful disaster.There seems to be more mis-reporting, than actual reporting about what is going on with the nuclear power plants. In particular, we have this nugget from CBS Sunday Morning by Lucy Craft in Tokyo:\\n\\nThe people of Japan should hope that this ends up like Three Mile Island.Of course, perception is much different than reality, and the activist old media seems to hope that the perception that they gave us after the worst nuclear disaster in America history (that killed no one) can be resurrected.   They want to bring back The China Syndrome and hope that all we will remember is Jane Fonda scaring the hell out of us. Maybe the media now actually believes the movie was real, and what happened at Three Mile Island was the fake, or, perhaps they\\u2019re just hoping the next generation doesn\\u2019t take the time to research what really happened at Three Mile Island.For the record, here\\u2019s what the Kearney Commission concluded about cancer cases after the meltdown of the reactor in Pennsylvania in 1979. Again, remember, there were zero fatalities from this nuclear meltdown.From Wikipedia:\\n\\nThoughts and prayers are still with the people of Japan at this time. This disaster is bad enough without having to worry about the nuclear component, but it is there and it is real. There could still be a horrific nuclear disaster heaped upon the damage already done, but let\\u2019s hope and pray that at this point, all they have is another Three Mile Island.\", \"article_id\": 269170, \"source_id\": 2, \"title\": \"Media Honesty Needed, Now More Than Ever\"}"
