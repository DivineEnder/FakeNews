"{\"title\": \"Anti-Fracking Campaigners Accused Of Faking Objections To Drilling Site\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Officials discovered the potential fraud attempt after finding uncanny similarities between letters objecting to shale gas extraction, including \\u201can array of template letters/e-mails submitted \\u2018en masse\\u2019\\u201d.They then decided to check the identities of the authors, only to find that some of them claimed never to have sent any such representation.Extraction firm Third Energy applied to North Yorkshire county council in July to frack at an existing gas site at Kirby Misperton, in the district of Ryedale. The council then invited members of the public to have their say and raise any objections.They received 2,465 letters and emails by the end of last week, but a council report says this has included \\u201cemails and letters that were sent unbeknown to the owner of the email address or the named person on the letter\\u201d.\\u201cThis has come to light by dint of each representation being acknowledged by the authority,\\u201d the report says. \\u201cThe authority has been informed by members of the public that their personal data may have been used without their consent.\\u201d\\u201cThe scale of the concern is unknown at this point. If any of the council\\u2019s enquiries raise matters that require police attention those matters will be referred to the police.\\u201dKen Cronin, chief executive of fracking trade organisation UKOOG,\\u00a0told the Telegraph: \\u201cThere is always a place for open, transparent and honest debate in this country. It is disturbing if true that some have taken upon themselves to circumvent that position.\\u201dLast week, Ryedale district council voted for a five-year moratorium on fracking in the area, but the vote is non-binding as the more senior North Yorkshire county council has final say on the issue.A spokesman for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said: \\u201cThere is a great deal of misleading information about unproven risks from fracking and shale gas.\\u201cShale gas is a great opportunity for this country, and the Royal Society of Engineers and Public Health England have both concluded that if carried out in accordance with the UK\\u2019s stringent health and safety regulations, fracking can be done safely.\\u201d\", \"article_id\": 246730}"
