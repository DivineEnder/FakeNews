"{\"content\": \"[F]or all the mockery LaPierre\\u2019s speech elicited (and maybe even deserved), history may well show it to be a canny political maneuver. By effectively shifting the conversation far to the right, he also shifted rightward what constituted a \\u201ccompromise\\u201d in the gun discussion. And ultimately, against all odds, his organization would emerge with a deal it could more than live with \\u2014 in fact, one it had once publicly proposed, itself.In other words, it is Wayne LaPierre who will get the last laugh.Even in the unlikely event the Manchin-Toomey compromise bill on extending background checks for gun purchases passes into law, it represents something that is a single raindrop away from being watered down into nothing. What Obama and his media will have won is a miniscule symbolic victory that cost Obama a lot of political capital and the media a ton of credibility and hard-earned ridicule. There could even be blowback in the form of lost Senate seats in 2014 for those Democrat senators in red states who will now have voted for something politically toxic. What I will always remember and cherish from this debate, though, is the media publicly opposing guarding school children against armed maniacs.The media will also always remember that, because Big Journalism will never allow them to forget. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC\\u00a0\", \"title\": \"Salon Declares NRA the Winner Over Obama, Media\"}"
