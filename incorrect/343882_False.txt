"{\"content\": \"{\\\"Your restaurant group has been in the news recently because it is phasing out tipping. When is the last time you left a tip?On Saturday night. At a restaurant in Brooklyn.\\\",\\\"How much?Probably 25 percent. I want to be a generous tipper because I know what the economics are like for the person on the receiving end.\\\",\\\"Have you ever worked for tips?Never as the primary part of my compensation. But I worked for my dad as a tour guide when I was 20, and people would give me tips.\\\",\\\"Did people tip you well?I did exceptionally well.\\\",\\\"In your new compensation model, waiters will share in the restaurant\\u2019s revenue, and customers will give feedback on a five-star scale. You\\u2019ve compared this to Uber a number of times. Uber doesn\\u2019t seem like the sort of labor model I would want to imitate.Well, Uber treats its employees like freelancers or like the croupier in Las Vegas. Our waiters work for us. In fact, they work for us now more than ever. Someone asked me, \\u2018\\u2018Isn\\u2019t your model socialist?\\u2019\\u2019 I would argue that tipping is far more socialist for this reason: In most fine-dining restaurants, tips are pooled. So when you leave your $50 tip, you think that you\\u2019re giving it to your server, but that server is actually sharing it with everybody who can receive tips.\\\",\\\"You said one goal with your tip ban is to right a wrong in the labor market. Do you think that sort of correction ought to be the purview of private businesses or government?I don\\u2019t want this to become law. As a matter of fact, if this becomes law and every other restaurant does what we do, my concern is we will lose one of the greatest commercial advantages we have. That\\u2019s what happened with smoking at the Union Square Cafe. We banned it in 1990 and after the citywide ban, we weren\\u2019t the one island you could go to to escape smoke.\\\",\\\"Before you got into restaurants, you interned on Capitol Hill and worked on John Anderson\\u2019s presidential campaign. What do you think politicians could learn from the hospitality industry?A lot. I think the best way to take care of your customers, or your constituents, is to first have an amazing work culture. I just can\\u2019t believe presidential candidates are never asked, \\u2018\\u2018Who are you as a boss?\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Trump seems to have turned that into his entire campaign.You know what? If I learned that the Trump organization was a great place to work, I would actually look at him differently than I do right now.\\\",\\\"When you hire people, you look for something you call \\u2018\\u2018H.Q.,\\u2019\\u2019 or hospitality quotient. You believe that, like I.Q., those emotional skills are innate. Do you assess this quality in everyone you meet?No. I have really, really wonderful friends and relatives who do not have a high H.Q.\\\",\\\"Have you developed a test for H.Q.?No. There\\u2019s in fact a danger: People in H.R. who do interviewing tend to have high H.Q.s themselves. That can be a liability. While conducting interviews, I have to turn off that part of me that cares about making the interviewee feel good.\\\",\\\"Do you have any pet peeves about service?Using the third person, like: \\u2018\\u2018Is the lady still enjoying her chicken?\\u2019\\u2019 I have a tough time with service-speak. You would never say to a friend, \\u2018\\u2018Is everything to your liking?\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Do you think there is an industry that could be improved by switching to a tipping model?No. I don\\u2019t know too many tipped professions where, as a parent, I would say, \\u2018\\u2018I really want my child to go into that profession.\\u2019\\u2019 It just feels unprofessional. It\\u2019s sad. It\\u2019s not that I want my kids to be doctors and lawyers \\u2014 we don\\u2019t have any in our family \\u2014 but would you tip your doctor? Would you tip your lawyer? Would you tip your architect? Would you tip the airline pilot? Implicit in the very custom of tipping is that the person on the receiving end would not have otherwise done as well for you, had you not tipped. It\\u2019s just .\\u2009.\\u2009. it\\u2019s icky.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 343882, \"title\": \"Danny Meyer Thinks Tipping Is Socialist\"}"
