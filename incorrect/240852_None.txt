"{\"title\": \"History Channel's 'World Wars' Ad Says WWII Made Stalin a Tyrant\", \"content\": \"\\u201cWWI Made Stalin a Man. WWII Made Him a Tyrant.\\u201dThe event in question is The History Channel\\u2019s\\u00a0The World Wars, a three-day presentation kicking off at 9 p.m. EST May 26. The teleplay covering both world wars follows \\u201ca 30-year global struggle. A fight that will either save the world\\u2013or destroy it,\\u201d according to the channel\\u2019s press materials.So why use a misleading tagline to tease the production? Joseph Stalin\\u2019s tyrannical ways began before the start of the second World War.Marion Smith, Executive Director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, pins the blame on the country\\u2019s general ignorance regarding communism and its impact.\\u201cWhat [the public] knows is very far from the truth,\\u201d Smith says.As for Stalin\\u2019s pre-WWII measures, consider the monstrous Holodomor in the early 1930s as a prime example of a tyrannical regime. Stalin\\u2019s Ukrainian policies resulted in massive death tolls. A country known as a European breadbasket suddenly couldn\\u2019t feed its citizens. The Soviets let some food rot while much was sold to the West to fill the government\\u2019s coffers. Stalin\\u2019s collectivist policies, combined with a ruthless enforcement policy, doomed millions.Smith adds that some fertile farm land was sectioned off by barbed wire so famished Ukrainians couldn\\u2019t reach the food within. Those somehow able to access the fields were shot, a \\u201cpolicy that came from the top,\\u201d Smith says. Landowners who managed to oversee prosperous farms despite those conditions were often targeted for death by the government.Breitbart News reached out to The History Channel for comment and context on the ad campaign. Through a spokesperson, the channel sent this explanation:THE WORLD WARS tells the story of three devastating decades of war told through the eyes of the powerful men who held the fate of humankind in their hands. We focus on men like Roosevelt, Hitler, Churchill and Stalin (among others) and how these individuals came of age in World War I before ultimately changing the history of mankind during World War II. Over the course of three nights, we take an unflinching look at these world figures\\u00a0and viewers will get a clear picture of\\u00a0Stalin\\u2019s ruthless rise to power in the Communist Party through\\u00a0WWI, and his vicious tyranny which grew even more despotic through WWII.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 240852}"
