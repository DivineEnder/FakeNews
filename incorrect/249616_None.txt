"{\"title\": \"Clarence Thomas Dissents from SCOTUS Skipping 'Assault Weapons' Case\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas in dissent.SCOTUS does not explain why it takes up some cases and refuses others, but\\u00a0Thomas and Scalia equated the court\\u2019s refusal to hear the case with \\u201cabdicating\\u2026 responsibility to enforce the constitutional right to keep and bear arms.\\u201dThomas wrote, \\u201cRoughly five million Americans own AR-15 style semiautomatic rifles.\\u201d And he explained that the \\u201coverwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting. Under our precedents that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons.\\u201dWhen Thomas says that SCOTUS\\u2019s precedents demonstrate that the commonality of the AR-15 is evidence of its protections under the Second Amendment,\\u00a0he is alluding to the court\\u2019s decision in District of Columbia v Heller (2008). There the court explained that the test of commonality is one of the chief means of ascertaining which weapons are protected for the people\\u2019s possession.According to Heller, \\u201cthe sorts of weapons protected\\u201d by the Second Amendment when it was written were those \\u201cin common use at the time.\\u201d And this has been\\u00a0true throughout the 224 years that have passed since the Second Amendment\\u2019s ratification. It means\\u00a0the guns \\u201cin common use\\u201d among the citizenry are the guns protected by the Bill of Rights. And with five million AR-15 owners in America today, those rifles are certainly \\u201cin common use\\u201d among the citizenry, and therefore protected.Certain other weapons are easily recognized as not \\u201cin common use\\u201d\\u2014shoulder-fired rockets, rocket propelled grenades, etc.\\u2014and are not covered by the precedents that exist under the Second Amendment.Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
