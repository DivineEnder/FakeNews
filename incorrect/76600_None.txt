"{\"content\": \"Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy wrote an opinion piece defending the Clinton Foundation from recent allegations in the book \\\"Clinton Cash\\\" that Hillary Clinton's work in the State Department were influenced by donations to the foundation.Ruddy, once an ardent Clinton critic who has since donated $1 million to the foundation, said the new allegations are tenuous at best, and that he doesn't want to return to the 1990s, when one Clinton allegation after another made the Republican party look bad.After seven years in working with the foundation, Ruddy, head of the conservative news site and television network Newsmax, wrote he's never experienced a \\\"whiff of politics\\\" or partisanship.\\\"Knowing a bit how this administration works, it is preposterous to think that President Obama or his White House approved any deal to benefit the Clinton Foundation or one of its donors,\\\" Ruddy wrote.Ruddy heaped praise on Bill Clinton and the foundation's work around the world, and admonished journalists to \\\"follow the money\\\" on the \\\"Clinton Cash\\\" book and its author Peter Schweizer.\\\"The sister companies of News Corp and 21st Century Fox own HarperCollins, which published Peter Schweizer\\u2019s book; they own The Wall Street Journal, which first raised the issue of the foreign donations; they own the New York Post, which broke the details about the Schweizer book; and they own Fox News, which gave the story oxygen and legs,\\\" Ruddy wrote. \\\"With so much media mojo from one company, there is no doubt they will be doing some pretty good 'cashing in' from the many millions of dollars their new best-seller will generate.\\\"Read the full Ruddy piece here.Hadas Gold is a reporter at\\u00a0Politico.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 76600, \"title\": \"Chris Ruddy defends Clinton Foundation\"}"
