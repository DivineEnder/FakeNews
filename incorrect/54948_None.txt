"{\"title\": \"Ohio poll: Obama 50, Romney 45\", \"content\": \"Another poll showing the Ohio race has tightened, but not to the point that Barack Obama has lost his lead over Mitt Romney:Mr. Obama holds a 50 to 45 percent lead over Romney among likely voters in the Buckeye State, down from a 53 to 43 percent advantage on Sept. 26. Three percent of likely voters there are undecided. ...The president is viewed as better on foreign policy, 50 to 43 percent, which will be the focus of tonight's debate, but his lead has shrunk from 13 to seven points on this measure. The candidates are now even on handling the economy; last month, the president led by six points on this issue. Romney has also widened his lead over the president on handling the budget deficit.The president continues to be seen by Ohio voters as caring about their needs and problems - 60 percent say he does while just 37 percent say he does not - similar to last month. While Mitt Romney has improved on this measure, more voters continue to think he does not care about their needs and problems than think he does.The original CBS/NYT/Quinnipiac poll showing Obama ahead by 10 points in Ohio was pretty hard to believe, as I wrote at the time. The big picture of Ohio is that it's the most Obama-friendly of the mega-swing states, and may still be Romney's biggest obstacle to victory, though it hasn't been totally impervious to the boost Romney's gotten over the three weeks since the first debate.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 54948}"
