"{\"title\": \"Daily Gut: The Military, the Media, and the Martini\", \"content\": \"Now imagine you were somebody who only got your news from USA Today. What a weird worldview you\\u2019d have.For one, you\\u2019d think colorful pie charts solve every problem, and you\\u2019d also think our military consists of nothing but troubled head cases. In the past year or so, USA Today has done little more than paint our military as rife with suicide, mental health problems, divorce, troubled kids and of course \\u2013 alcohol and drug abuse.Let\\u2019s look at the most recent USA Today piece on alcohol abuse. The paper reported that \\u201cSoldiers\\u2026with alcoholism or alcohol abuse, such as binge drinking, increased from 6.1 per 1,000 soldiers in 2003 to an estimated 11.4 as of March 31.\\u201dThat is disturbing, no doubt \\u2013 and it\\u2019s all from military data. But what happens if you compare that figure to our general population? Well, according to the National Institutes of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 15.5 percent of the general population report episodes of binge drinking in 2006 \\u2013 and for males alone \\u2013 the number jumps over 20 percent.Okay, think about that. Twenty percent of males in the general population binge drink \\u2013 that\\u2019s one in five.In the military \\u2013 largely made up of young males who deserve to drink \\u2013 it\\u2019s six soldiers per 1,000.What does that tell you? Well, first: our soldiers seem far more well-adjusted than USA Today would like to let on. And also: our soldiers are far more capable of handling alcohol than non-military bozos like myself.That should be no surprise: these are discipline dudes, and unlike me, their jobs require them to be clear-eyed and sober. As a magazine veteran and a television talking head, I can safely say that nearly all media jobs can be done drunk. The only dangerous machinery we face is an elevator.Now to be fair to USA Today, my analysis is not perfect (I\\u2019ve had four martinis already). And I confess I\\u2019m not comparing apples to apples \\u2013 the NIAAA stat was collected differently than the number cited in USA Today. Still, there\\u2019s a fundamental truth here: Our military doesn\\u2019t just rock physically, but also psychologically. It\\u2019s a truth that goes against USA Today\\u2019s and most film directors\\u2019 desire to paint our soldiers as ticking time bombs.Finally, buried in the same USA Today piece is another interesting fact: \\u201cEnrollments in drug abuse treatment programs have remained largely unchanged in the Army during the war, rising from 3.7 per 1,000 in 2003 to an estimated 4.2 as of May.\\u201dThink about that. As rehab clinics in America become more commonplace than bowling leagues \\u2013 the Army presses on during the toughest of times.I\\u2019ll drink to that.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 279328}"
