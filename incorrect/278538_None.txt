"{\"title\": \"Daily Gut: Aversive Racism\", \"content\": \"So after witnessing the waves of antipathy across the country toward President Obama\\u2019s policies, New York Times writer Charles Blow introduces his readers to the term, \\u201caversive racism.\\u201d It\\u2019s a sinister kind of prejudice, Charles explains, that reveals itself in disagreements based on factors \\u201cother than race.\\u201dA simpler definition of aversive racism?If you say it\\u2019s not about race, then it\\u2019s really about race.See: if you\\u2019re against socialized medicine, it\\u2019s really because our President, who\\u2019s for it, is black. If you\\u2019re against the redistribution of wealth because it goes against your own beliefs in free markets and individual achievement \\u2013 it\\u2019s because Obama is black. If you\\u2019ve done a lot of research on global warming, and decided it\\u2019s hypothetical hooey \\u2013 that belief is now racist, since Obama buys into climate change hysteria.Isn\\u2019t it awesome how everything you believe in, is now just proof you\\u2019re a bigot!That\\u2019s why aversive racism might be the greatest invention ever for the left, because it exempts them defending their own screwy beliefs. If you disagree with any worn out or destructive \\u201cprogressive\\u201d idea \\u2013 then you must be a hood-wearing hater. It\\u2019s the low-down trick to end all low-down tricks, and it gives the left what it so desperately needs: immunity for their reviled beliefs.As a rightie, I don\\u2019t see color \\u2013 a black liberal and a white liberal are all just liberals. But it\\u2019s different on the left. Progressives hate conservatives, but they hate black conservatives more. They hate right wingers, but they hate Hispanic right wingers more. They hate Republicans, but they hate female Republicans more. This intolerance it directed purely at people different from themselves, reflecting the reverse of aversive racism: real racism.And if you disagree with me, then you\\u2019re most definitely a racist.Tonight we\\u2019ve got S.E. Cupp, John Devore, Trace Gallagher and a special guest (hint: it\\u2019s another Breitbart blockbuster\\u2026he really is a human firework).\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 278538}"
