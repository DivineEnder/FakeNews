"{\"title\": \"Climate Alarmist: Only Climate Alarmists Should Be Allowed on Television\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"So says the producer of a highly tendentious and misleading new eco-propaganda movie about global warming, apparently blissfully unaware of the irony of his position.Robert Kenner is the producer of Merchants of Doubt, a documentary which seeks to claim that climate scepticism is nothing but a fossil-fuel-funded conspiracy co-ordinated by the same kind of cackling evil-doers who tried to persuade you that smoking doesn\\u2019t cause cancer.Like the Obama administration, the movie takes for granted the notion that catastrophic man-made climate change is real, that all the scientists promoting the theory are reliable, honest and principled, and that the only possible reason anyone might have for claiming otherwise is that they are \\u201cmerchants of doubt\\u201d \\u2013 ie corrupt disinformers who deliberately and cynically seek to hide the truth about global warming from the public because they have been paid to do so by sinister corporate interests.Now Kenner has written a public letter to one of his fellow celebrity alarmists, scientist-turned-filmmaker Randy Olson, to help promote his crappy film raise awareness in the media of the very serious issue of Big Oil funded denialism.The letter says:Dear Randy,People who mislead the public on climate change should not be on TV. Period.That\\u2019s one big reason why I produced Merchants of Doubt, a film that lays bare the greedy, shameful world of climate denial and the journalists who broadcast it. That\\u2019s also why, right now, we\\u2019re launching a people-powered national campaign that could keep climate deniers out of the news for good.Merchants of Doubt premieres in U.S. theaters today, and it will invite thousands of energized viewers to sign this petition and join our campaign. Let\\u2019s lead the charge!Join me to tell TV network and cable news directors: Stop booking \\u201cmerchants of doubt\\u201d on your programs immediately.In 2013, one-third of the climate coverage on CNN and over a half of the climate coverage on Fox News was misleading. In 2014, every Sunday show except CBS\\u2019 Face the Nation hosted a climate denier. It\\u2019s true: our mainstream news networks book fake experts \\u2014\\u00a0 often paid by the fossil fuel industry \\u2014 and those \\u201cexperts\\u201d use the opportunity to confuse the public understanding on climate.Forecast the Facts has successfully held the media accountable before. One year ago, over 100,000 of us pushed The Washington Post to improve its climate reporting, and we won. Now we can do it again with our TV news.Merchants of Doubt gives this community a special chance to make our issue \\u2014 climate denial \\u2014 the national issue it should be. Let\\u2019s make it count.Add your name today: Join the campaign to end climate denial in the media.Sincerely,Robert KennerAmong the Evil Climate Change Deniers (TM) featured prominently in Kenner\\u2019s scare movie is Marc Morano of Climate Depot whose performance \\u2013 reading between the lines of some of the reviews so far \\u2013 would appear to be about the only thing that makes this earnest agitprop worth watching.Morano \\u2013 a regular on TV debates with climate alarmists \\u2013 is presumably one of those deniers Kenner is keen to ban from television.Unfortunately when I rang Morano yesterday for a comment on this, his third underbutler informed me that Mr Morano was unavailable because he was hosting a party for senior oil industry figures on his 600 foot yacht Drowning Polar Bear III.\", \"article_id\": 183702}"
