The claim came in evidence submitted to a Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry into sharia courts.In 2008, the Sunday Times revealed that MAT had intervened in six cases of domestic violence, leading to complaints lodged with the police being withdrawn by the women. MAC told the men to undergo anger management classes and mentoring from \\u201ccommunity elders\\u201d.\\u201cThe Mat actively involves itself in criminal proceedings on domestic violence. It uses its position of power to persuade the [Crown Prosecution Service] CPS to drop charges and to encourage women to reconcile with abusive partners without reference to court orders they may already have or to risk assessments and safety planning,\\u201d SBS\\u2019s submission insists.They are now asking the CPS to \\u201creconsider\\u201d certain cases described as an \\u201cattempt to sabotage criminal proceedings\\u201d.On their website, SBS added: \\u201cOur concern is that religious arbitration forums are gaining power and significance as parallel legal system in which women are treated unfairly, especially in relation to divorce, maintenance, custody over children, inheritance and property matters.\\u201dLord Macdonald, former director of public prosecutions, told the Sunday Times:\\u201cWhen a formal criminal charge is laid it is not appropriate for an extrajudicial institution to bring the victim and her alleged attacker together to seek a \\u2018resolution\\u2019 beyond the control of the UK courts and certainly not where that institution itself has a questionable approach to the rights of women and to their supposed place in society.\\u201dMAT said: \\u201cWe condemn actions taken by anyone to restrict or impede the pathway to justice sought by any victim of domestic violence.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2}"
