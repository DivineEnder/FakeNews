"{\"title\": \"Stock Selloff: Key Levels to Watch\", \"source_id\": 22245, \"article_id\": 349622, \"content\": \"Friday\\u2019s GOP flameout came close enough to the closing bell on Wall Street that the market didn\\u2019t really have time to fully react to the scuttling of the health-care\\u00a0bill. They\\u2019ve had a weekend to think about it, and the wider ramifications, and have decided it\\u2019s\\u00a0as bad as it first appeared.U.S. stocks tripped out of the gate on Monday, with the S&P 500 down as many as 22 points, at 2322; it is last down 10 points at 2333. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as many as 184 points at 20413. It is currently down 112 points, but still likely to extend its seven-day losing streak to eight.The large-cap indexes, really, are just catching up to weakness that started showing in other areas earlier. Small caps, as measured by the Russell 2000, have been weak. That index is down more than 4% over the past month. Financial stocks have also been weak, down 5% in a\\u00a0month. Energy and industrial stocks are both down more than 3% in that time frame.\\u201cNo matter where you look,\\u201d said Instinet executive director Frank Cappelleri, \\u201cthe mood officially has changed this month.\\u201d The only question now is whether this builds itself up into something nastier.The large caps have not yet touched any significant technical tripwires, prompting technical analyst Michael Oliver at Momentum Structural Analysis to label the recent declines \\u201cjust a wounding.\\u201d The market\\u2019s backbone hasn\\u2019t been broken, he says. \\u201cNot yet anyway.\\u201dThe first technical level to watch is the 50-day moving average for the S&P 500, which lies at 2332. That got taken out at the opening bell, and will be material is the index closes below it. The 100-day is at 2274, and the 200-day is at 2209. Each of those is increasingly important, an indication that longer-term momentum is waning.Even if the losses on the major indexes still appear small, it\\u2019s worth questioning if a corner has been turned. Mr.\\u00a0Cappelleri noted that the last time the Dow dropped seven days in a row was a period that ended on Nov. 4, just before the election.\\u00a0It marked a key low then, and other long-ish losing streaks over the past few years\\u00a0have also marked inflection points. \\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t paint the prettiest picture for the next few weeks,\\u201d he said.Mr. Oliver measures momentum in the indexes in a different manner, running it through his own model, and so finds somewhat different tripwires. Even before Friday\\u2019s vote, he was warning about short-term momentum.\\u00a0Now he\\u2019s flagging longer term measures of momentum. He sees a three-quarter, long-term average \\u00a0momentum being broken for the S&P around 2224.Now, that figure is slightly above the 200-day moving average, and a drop from the March high to the 200-day would represent only about a 7.7% loss, one reason why some in the market are talking up a proverbial \\u201chealthy correction.\\u201d Mr. Oliver isn\\u2019t so sure.\\u201cEven if the price chart looks safe for a drop into the 220os, momentum says something else.\\u201dAs always with technical analysis, keep in mind that these are guideposts. They can give the observant a leg up in guessing which way the next move is going, but ultimately the fundamentals will be the most important driver. If President Trump can do the cat-herding thing in Congress, and still get something of his agenda through, the market can stabilize. If not, the market\\u2019s election-day bet will likely keep getting wounded.For more insight into stocks and bonds, deals and dealmakers, the economy and business, be sure to\\u00a0subscribe to the MoneyBeat podcast.\"}"
