"{\"article_id\": 251076, \"title\": \"'The Wind Through the Keyhole' Review: King's Triumphant 'Tower' Return\", \"content\": \"\\u201cThe Wind Through the Keyhole: A Dark Tower Novel\\u201d takes place between books four and five of the \\u201cTower\\u201d series. However, one doesn\\u2019t need to be familiar with the previous installments to enjoy and understand this tale within a tale.\\u00a0\\u201cKeyhole\\u201d is a fusion of stories. First, we begin with Roland and his friends taking refuge in an old building after being held up in their travels by a storm. There, Roland begins to tell them of one of his first adventures as a young gunslinger catching a \\u201cskin man\\u201d (a shape shifter who takes the form of animals).\\u00a0However, within this story, Roland meets a young boy to whom he tells a story that goes by the same name as the novel\\u2019s title. Once this story is over, we head back for the conclusion of our \\u201cskin man\\u201d saga.Confusing stuff, no doubt. But perhaps the aspect that King should be praised for this late in his writing career is actually making this complicated structure work to the benefit of each individual tale. He pulls it off by connecting these stories and allowing them to build off one another, but never in obvious ways.\\u00a0Both stories build quite well and have a bit of a Hitchcockian suspense to them that grows irritating if only for moments when we yearn for the finales we have been promised. That only speaks to King\\u2019s talent.The author should also be praised for his insightful and thorough imagination. The world he draws here with his mind becomes surprisingly clear and original as the novel progresses. He never bogs the reader down in endless detail or steps back too far leaving us out to dry, as we wonder how the hell a skin man looks when he morphs, and what a mage looks like.\\u00a0He also creates some very memorable characters who become clear as day through their humor and actions, like a memorable tax man (who readers will love) and the young, brave Tim who is the hero of the \\u201cKeyhole\\u201d story.\\u00a0Gunslingers, boys on missions, manipulating tax men, magical forests \\u2026 it\\u2019s a testament to King\\u2019s writing that none of this is very laughable to the reader, even one not familiar with Mid World or its sometimes confusing rules, legends and language.Those new to the \\u201cDark Tower\\u201d series might get lost in King\\u2019s dense mythology, and King\\u2019s portrayal of guns in the story is also disappointing.\\u00a0Guns are rarely referred to beyond \\u201csix shooters\\u201d or such. Yet King attempts great poetry in the relationship between the weapons and those who wield them. This poetry only can go so far, since King never truly gives the weapons a life of their own, but this may be due to the politics of the author.\\u00a0And it\\u2019s only a slight criticism, since the gunslingers like young Roland and young Jamie are given great dimension.It\\u2019s easy to disagree with King\\u2019s politics wholeheartedly, and some find it easy to dismiss the veteran author, but I find it difficult to dismiss Kings storytelling abilities. He was born to do what he\\u2019s doing, much like Spielberg was born to make movies.\\u00a0King may not be as original as he once was, but his newest novel is a surprise feat in complicated storytelling that succeeds both on a technical level and a storytelling level.\\u00a0\\u201cThe Wind Through the Keyhole\\u201d is a great read for anyone who loves fantasy or just terrific stories.Sucker Punches: None really. There\\u2019s an evil tax man that will be a favorite of our readers, and a brief moment where someone talks about the \\u201cold world\\u201d and their material obsessions. However, one main character ponders taxes and whether they keep us from being \\u201ctruly free.\\u201dAll in all, this novel\\u2019s agenda is little more than entertaining, and it does that plenty enough.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
