"{\"title\": \"Trump Unloads in Pennsylvania Speech: Hillary Clinton 'Should Be in Prison'\", \"content\": \"Trump said in the speech on Saturday night:A new audio tape that has surfaced just yesterday from another one of Hillary\\u2019s high roller fundraisers shows her demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. You know, and I\\u2019ll tell you something we have a much bigger movement that Bernie Sanders ever had. We have much bigger crowds than Sanders ever had. And we have a more important movement than Bernie Sanders ever had because we\\u2019re going to save our country, okay? We\\u2019re going to save our country. But I can tell you Bernie Sanders would have left a great, great legacy had he not made the deal with the devil. He would have really left a great legacy. Now he shows up and 120 people come in to hear him talk. Bernie Sanders would have left a great legacy had he not made the deal, had he held his head high and walked away. Now he\\u2019s on the other side perhaps from us and we want to get along with everybody and we will\\u2014we\\u2019re going to unite the country\\u2014but what Bernie Sanders did to his supporters was very, very unfair. And they\\u2019re really not his supporters any longer and they\\u2019re not going to support Hillary Clinton. I really believe a lot of those people are coming over and largely because of trade, college education, lots of other things\\u2014but largely because of trade, they\\u2019re coming over to our side\\u2014you watch, you watch. Especially after Hillary mocks him and mocks all of those people by attacking him and his supporters as \\u2018living in their parents\\u2019 basements,\\u2019 and trapped in dead-end careers. That\\u2019s not what they are.Also in his speech on Saturday night, Trump summed up exactly what came out in the latest Hillary Clinton tapes in which\\u00a0she mocks Sanders supporters:She describes many of them as ignorant, and [that] they want the United States to be more like Scandinavia but that \\u2018half the people don\\u2019t know what that means\\u2019 in a really sarcastic tone because she\\u2019s a sarcastic woman. To sum up, and I\\u2019ll tell you the other thing\\u2014she\\u2019s an incompetent woman. She\\u2019s an incompetent woman. I\\u2019ve seen it. Just take a look at what she touches. It never works out, and you watch: her run for the presidency will never ever work out because we can\\u2019t let it work out. To sum up, Hillary Clinton thinks Bernie supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement dwellers. Then, of course, she thinks people who vote for and follow us are deplorable and irredeemable. I don\\u2019t think so. I don\\u2019t think so. We have the smartest people, we have the sharpest people, we have the most amazing people, and you know in all of the years of this country they say, even the pundits\\u2014most of them aren\\u2019t worth the ground they\\u2019re standing on, some of that ground could be fairly wealthy but ground, but most of these people say they have never seen a phenomenon like is going on. We have crowds like this wherever we go.WATCH THE FULL SPEECH:Later in the speech, Trump came back to the tape again and hammered her once more for it.\\n\\u201cHillary Clinton all but said that most of the country is racist, including the men and women of law enforcement,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cShe said that the other night. Did anybody like Lester Holt? Did anybody question her when she said that? No, she said it the other night. [If] you\\u2019re not a die hard Clinton fan\\u2014you\\u2019re not a supporter\\u2014from Day One, Hillary Clinton thinks you are a defective person. That\\u2019s what she\\u2019s going around saying.\\u201dIn the speech, Trump questioned whether Clinton has the moral authority to lead when she considers the majority of Americans\\u2014Trump supporters and Sanders supporters\\u2014to be \\u201cdefective\\u201d people. And he went so far as saying that Clinton \\u201cshould be in prison.\\u201d He went on:How on earth can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has nothing but contempt for the people who live in this country? She\\u2019s got contempt. First of all, she\\u2019s got so many scandals and she\\u2019s been caught cheating so much. One of the worst things I\\u2019ve ever witnessed as a citizen of the United States was last week when the FBI director was trying so hard to explain how she away with what she got away with, because she should be in prison. Let me tell you. She should be in prison. She\\u2019s being totally protected by the New York Times and the Washington Post and all of the media and CNN\\u2014Clinton News Network\\u2014which nobody is watching anyway so what difference does it make? Don\\u2019t even watch it. But she\\u2019s being protected by many of these groups. It\\u2019s not like do you think she\\u2019s guilty? They\\u2019ve actually admitted she\\u2019s guilty. And then she lies and lies, 33,000 emails deleted, bleached, acid-washed! And then they take their phones and they hammer the hell out of them. How many people have acid washed or bleached a Tweet? How many?He returned to the secret Clinton tape a little while later:Hillary Clinton slanders and attacks anyone who wants to put America First, whether they are Trump Voters or Bernie Voters. What she said about Bernie voters amazing. Like the European Union, she wants to erase our borders and she wants to do it for her donors and she wants people to pour into country without knowing who they are.Trump later bashed the media as \\u201cdishonest as hell\\u201d when calling on the reporters at his event to \\u201cturn your cameras\\u201d to show the crowd that came to see him.\\u201cIf they showed the kind of crowds we have\\u2014which people can hear, you know it\\u2019s interesting: you can hear the crowd when you hear the television but if they showed the crowd it would be better television, but they don\\u2019t know much about that. But it would actually be better television,\\u201d Trump said.Trump also questioned whether Hillary Clinton has been loyal to her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton has been known to cheat on Hillary Clinton with a variety of mistresses and has been accused of rape and sexual assault by some women.\\u201cHillary Clinton\\u2019s only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t even think she\\u2019s loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really, folks, really: Why should she be, right? Why should she be?\\u201dThroughout the speech, Trump weaved together references to his new campaign theme about Clinton\\u2014\\u201cFollow The Money\\u201d\\u2014with details about the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. He said:We\\u2019re going to take on the corrupt media, the powerful lobbyists and the special interests that have stolen your jobs, your factories, and your future\\u2014that\\u2019s exactly what\\u2019s happened. We\\u2019re going to stop Hillary Clinton from continuing to raid the industry from your state for her profit. Hillary Clinton has collected millions of dollars from the same global corporations shipping your jobs and your dreams to other countries. You know it and everybody else knows it. That\\u2019s why Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100 percent approve Trans Pacific Partnership\\u2014a total disastrous trade deal. She called the deal the \\u2018gold standard.\\u2019 The TPP will bring economic devastation to Pennsylvania and our campaign is the only chance to stop that and other bad things that are happening to our country. She lied about the Gold Standard the other night at the debate. She said she didn\\u2019t say it\\u2014she said it. We want to stop the Trans Pacific Partnership and if we don\\u2019t\\u2014remember this, if we don\\u2019t stop it, billions and billions [of dollars] in jobs and wealth will be vacuumed right out of Pennsylvania and sent to these other countries. Just like NAFTA was a disaster, this will be a disaster. Frankly I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019ll be as bad as NAFTA. It can\\u2019t get any worse than that\\u2014signed by Bill Clinton. All of us here in this massive room here tonight can prevent this from happening. Together we can stop TPP and we can end the theft of American jobs and prosperity.Trump praised Sanders for being strongly opposed to the TPP:I knew one man\\u2014I\\u2019m not a big fan\\u2014but one man who knew the dangers of the TPP was Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. He was right about one thing, only one thing, and that was trade. He was right about it because he knew we were getting ripped off, but he wouldn\\u2019t be able to do anything about it. We\\u2019re going to do a lot about it. We\\u2019re going to have those highways running the opposite direction. We\\u2019re going to have a lot of trade, but it\\u2019s going to come into our country. We are going to start benefitting our country because right now it\\u2019s one way road to trouble. Our jobs leave us, our money leaves us. With Mexico, we get the drugs\\u2014they get the cash\\u2014it\\u2019s that simple.Hillary Clinton, Trump noted, is \\u201ccontrolled by global special interests.\\u201d\\u201cShe\\u2019s on the opposite side of Bernie on the trade issue,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s totally on the opposite side of Bernie.\\u201dHe circled back to trade a bit later in the more-than-hour-long speech, hammering TPP and Clinton cash connections. Trump continued:Three TPP member countries gave between $6 and $15 million to Clinton. At least four lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign. I\\u2019m just telling you Pennsylvania, we\\u2019re going to make it. We\\u2019re going to make it. We\\u2019re going to make it if we have Pennsylvania for sure. It\\u2019ll be easy. But you cannot let this pass. NAFTA passed. It\\u2019s been the worst trade deal probably ever passed, not in this country but anywhere in the world. It cleaned out New England. It cleaned out big portions of Pennsylvania. It cleaned out big portions of Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina\\u2014you can\\u2019t let it happen.Trump even called the politicians like Clinton \\u201cbloodsuckers\\u201d who have let America be drained out of millions upon millions of jobs.\\u201cThese bloodsuckers want it to happen,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re politicians that are getting taken care of by people that want it to happen. Other countries want it to happen because it\\u2019s good for them, but it\\u2019s not good for us. So hopefully you\\u2019re not going to let it happen. Whatever Hillary\\u2019s donors want, they get. They own her. On Nov. 8, we\\u2019re going to end Clinton corruption. Hillary Clinton, dishonest person, is an insider fighting for herself and for her friends. I\\u2019m an outsider fighting for you. And by the way, just in case you\\u2019re not aware, I used to be an insider but I thought this was the right thing to do. This is the right thing to do, believe me.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 298964}"
