"{\"title\": \"'Crowdsource' This: Emails Expose #OccupyWallStreet Conspiracy to 'Destabalize' Global Markets, Governments\", \"content\": \"We\\u2019re in this for the long haul. There are no \\u201csolutions\\u201d that can be  presented quickly to make us go away. And so there will be moments where our  presence is no longer an uncomfortable and unknown variable, but rather is  normalized and integrated. It\\u2019s in those moments that we have to push the  envelop [sic], pry open the space of possibility even farther. We go as far as we  can to destabalize [sic], but maintain momentum. And when that\\u2019s the new \\u201cnormal\\u201d  then we go farther. That\\u2019s how change happens, how we shift the terrain and  the terms of the game.\\u2013 Email in \\u201cOccupy\\u201d archive, \\u201cRe: Can OWS be turned into a Democratic Party Movement?\\u201d; Wednesday, October 12, 2011In keeping with the new media notion of crowdsourcing\\u2013enthusiastically embraced by the mainstream media when trawling through Sarah Palin\\u2019s emails\\u2013Big Government will be providing readers later today with links to a document drop consisting of thousands of emails.The email archive, created by a private cyber security researcher, appears to contain messages shared by the left\\u2019s anarcho-socialist activists during the strategic and daily tactical planning of the \\u201cOccupy Wall Street\\u201d and broader \\u201cOccupy\\u201d campaign this fall.Big Government received a tip about the existence of the archive, and we were able to contact the individual who compiled and posted it. He will describe the archive, and how he obtained the emails, later this morning exclusively on Big Government.Through \\u201ccrowdsourcing,\\u201d the media and the public will then be able to discover the truth behind the \\u201cOccupy\\u201d movement.The archive includes emails, for example, from radical anarchist organizer Lisa Fithian, who was  profiled earlier this week at Big Government,  and who is one of the leading organizers behind the Occupy movement.In one email, dated October 1, Fithian applauds the launch of \\u201coccupations\\u201d throughout the country. She also highlights an ACORN-style illegal home occupation in California, linking to a television news story that reveals the involvement of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), which is apparently the reconstituted version of ACORN in California.\\n\\n\\n// \\n<BR/>    var docstoc_docid=\\\"99246646\\\";var docstoc_title=\\\"OWSMailList_0001-3\\\";var docstoc_urltitle=\\\"OWSMailList_0001-3\\\";\\n<BR/>//   OWSMailList_0001-3 \\u2013   Per the 8800+ pages of emails (3900+ emails), the Occupy movement has been in the works for some time. Its leaders apparently intend for it to broaden out and intertwine with the Days of Rage global initiative, which is set to begin on Saturday, October 15th. They also intend the demonstrations to continue indefinitely, as suggested in the following email, dated Monday, October 10:\\nThe true purpose of the Occupy movement appears to be further economic and governmental destabilization, at a time when the world is already facing major financial and political challenges.   By embracing the Occupy movement, President Barack Obama, the Democrat Party, and their union allies may be supporting an effort to harm both the domestic and global economies; to create social unrest throughout the democratic world; and to embrace other radical causes, including the anti-Israel movement.   Ironically, the emails suggest that the President and the Democrat Party may soon find their friends in the Occupy movement to be a political burden. The email below calls for the Occupy movement to begin \\u201cexecuting higher-risk actions, civil disobedience and arrests,\\u201d and suggests: \\u201cWe must draw a line, disavow the Democrats explicitly, make our messaging a little uncomfortable.\\u201d   \\n DNC Go Further \\u2013>The email exchanges in the archive begin on September 14th, 2011 and continue through this week.Later this morning, readers will be able to read the emails for themselves\\u2013and the mainstream media will be forced to confront the truth behind the Occupy movement, including its links to socialist, anarchist, and possibly even jihadist organizations.Brandon Darby, a former left-wing activist, will be following up in the coming days with his own analysis and interpretation of select email exchanges. After Hurricane Katrina, Darby became alienated by his former comrades\\u2019 anti-Americanism and propensity for violence, and became an FBI informant. In that role, he was essential to the prevention of a planned Molotov cocktail attack on the 2008 Republican National Convention. Darby is in a unique position to understand the key players and tactics behind the \\u201cOccupy\\u201d movement, and to help derail the left\\u2019s pursuit of broader global destabilization.Send your thoughts and observations about the email archive to feedback@breitbart.com,  or post them in the comment section.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 230751}"
