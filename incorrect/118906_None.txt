"{\"title\": \"The Kennedy Assassination: All Roads Lead to Moscow?\", \"content\": \"Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa\\u2013the highest ranking intelligence official ever to have defected from the Soviet bloc\\u2013in his books Programmed to Kill: Lee Harvey Oswald, the Soviet KGB, and the Kennedy Assassination and Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism\\u00a0suggests that\\u00a0all roads in the plot to kill President John F. Kennedy lead back to Moscow.\\u00a0According to his own account (as told by those who knew or spoke with him), Lee Harvey Oswald became interested in Marxism in 1952 or 1953, when an \\u201cold lady\\u201d handed him \\u201ca pamphlet about saving the Rosenbergs.\\u201d (In addition to the Rosenbergs\\u2019 crimes, the \\u201csave the Rosenbergs\\u201d propaganda campaign was one of the most successful in KGB history\\u2013having the effect of creating and enflaming massive anti-Americanism. It just goes to show that you never know who is listening, or in this case, reading what you write.)\\u00a0Then, a few years later, Oswald was in the Marines stationed abroad, where, as he later said \\u201cI met some Communists in Japan and they got me excited and interested, and that was one of my inducements in going to Soviet Russia, to see what goes on there.\\u201d To be more precise, he met some pretty girls in the local bars frequented by American servicemen (a favorite recruiting ground for the KGB) and began spending more money than he made. He had access to information regarding the classified U-2 spy planes, and the Soviets very much wanted this information. When he returned to America, he was stationed in Texas, and continued\\u00a0 his strange behavior, like having bags full of classified information deposited in an empty locker at a bus station in Los Angeles, California and at times going off on his own to meet \\u201cfriends\\u201d in Tijuana, Mexico. Around that time, the Soviets started receiving classified information on the U-2 from their sources. \\u00a0While Oswald was in the Soviet Union, momentous events continued to shape the globe: \\u00a0Not only was \\u201chis Soviet connection in good working condition\\u201d, but he even moved in with the previously mentioned Soviet agent known as George de Mohrenschildt in Dallas.\\u00a0As to the events in the months leading up to November 22, 1963, no description can be better than the one Gen. Pacepa gave to FrontPageMag in 2007. It is a bit long, but well worth the required attention span:\\u00a0FP: So give us some concrete KGB fingerprints.Pacepa: Let\\u2019s take the handwritten note in Russian Oswald left his Soviet wife, Marina, just before he tried to kill American general Edwin Walker in a dry run before going on to assassinate President Kennedy. That very important note contains two KGB codes: friends (code for support officer) and Red Cross (code for financial help). In this note, Oswald tells Marina what to do in case he is arrested. He stresses that she should contact the (Soviet) \\u201cembassy,\\u201d that they have \\u201cfriends here,\\u201d and that the \\u201cRed Cross\\u201d will help her financially. Particularly significant is Oswald\\u2019s instruction for her to \\u201csend the embassy the information about what happened to me.\\u201d At that time the code for embassy was \\u201coffice,\\u201d but it seems that Oswald wanted to be sure Marina would understand that she should immediately inform the Soviet embassy. It is noteworthy that Marina did not mention this note to U.S. authorities after Oswald\\u2019s arrest. It was found at the home of Ruth Paine, an American friend with whom Marina was staying at the time of the assassination.FP: The Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that Oswald had no connection whatsoever with the KGB. But according to your book, Oswald secretly met an officer of the KGB\\u2019s assassination department in Mexico City just a few weeks before shooting President Kennedy. What\\u2019s the evidence?Pacepa: There are many bits of evidence proving Oswald\\u2019s connection with the KGB. A tangible one is the letter he sent to the Soviet embassy in Washington a few days after meeting \\u201cComrade Kostin\\u201d in Mexico City. Elsewhere Oswald identified the person he had met there as \\u201cComrade Kostikov.\\u201d The CIA has identified Valery Kostikov as an officer of the PGU\\u2019s Thirteenth Department for \\u201cwet affairs\\u201d (wet being a euphemism for bloody). A handwritten draft of that letter was found among Oswald\\u2019s effects after the assassination. The previously mentioned Ruth Paine testified that Oswald re-wrote that letter several times before typing it on her typewriter. Marina stated he \\u201cretyped the envelope ten times.\\u201d It was important to him. A photocopy of the final letter Oswald sent to the Soviet embassy was recovered by the Warren Commission. Let me quote from that letter, in which I have also inserted Oswald\\u2019s earlier draft version in brackets:\\u201cThis is to inform you of recent events since my meetings with comrade Kostin [in draft: \\u201cof new events since my interviews with comrade Kostine\\u201c] in the Embassy of the Soviet Union, Mexico City, Mexico. I was unable to remain in Mexico [crossed out in draft: \\u201cbecause I considered useless\\u201c] indefinily because of my mexican visa restrictions which was for 15 days only. I could not take a chance on requesting a new visa [in draft: \\u201capplying for an extension\\u201c] unless I used my real name, so I returned to the United States.\\u201dThe fact that Oswald used an operational codename for Kostikov confirms to me that both his meeting with Kostikov in Mexico City and his correspondence with the Soviet Embassy in Washington were conducted in a PGU operational context. The fact that Oswald did not use his real name to obtain his Mexican visa confirms this conclusion.Now let\\u2019s juxtapose this combined letter against the free guide book Esta Semana-This Week, September 28 \\u2013 October 4, 1963, and a Spanish-English dictionary, both found among Oswald\\u2019s effects. The guide book has the Soviet embassy\\u2019s telephone number underlined, the names Kosten and Osvald noted in Cyrillic on the page listing \\u201cDiplomats in Mexico,\\u201d and check marks next to five movie theaters on the previous page. In the back of his Spanish-English dictionary Oswald wrote: \\u201cbuy tickets [plural] for bull fight,\\u201d and the Plaza M\\u00e9xico bullring is encircled on his Mexico City map. Also marked on Oswald\\u2019s map is the Palace of Fine Arts, a favorite place for tourists to assemble on Sunday mornings to watch the Ballet Folkl\\u00f3rico.Contrary to what Oswald claimed, he was not observed at the Soviet embassy at any time during his stay in Mexico City, although the CIA had surveillance cameras trained on the entrance to the embassy at that time. In short, all of the above facts taken together suggest to me that Oswald resorted to an unscheduled or \\u201ciron meeting\\u201d\\u2013zheleznaya yavka in Russian\\u2013for an urgent talk with Kostikov in Mexico City. The \\u201ciron meeting\\u201d was a standard KGB procedure for emergency situations, iron meaning ironclad or invariable.In my day I approved quite a few \\u201ciron meetings\\u201d in Mexico City (a favorite place for contacting our important agents living in the U.S.), and Oswald\\u2019s \\u201ciron meeting\\u201d looks to me like a typical one. That means: a brief encounter at a movie house to arrange a meeting for the following day at the bullfights (in Mexico City they were held at 4:30 on Sunday afternoon); a brief encounter in front of the Palace of Fine Arts to pass Kostikov one of the bullfight tickets Oswald had bought; and a long meeting for discussions at the Sunday bullfight.Of course, I cannot be sure that everything happened exactly that way\\u2013every case officer had his own quirks. But however they may have connected, it is clear that Kostikov and Oswald did secretly meet over that weekend of September 28-29, 1963. On the following Tuesday, still in Mexico City, he telephoned the Soviet embassy from the Cuban embassy and asked the guard on duty to connect him with \\u201cComrade Kostikov\\u201d with whom he had \\u201ctalked on September 28.\\u201d That phone call was intercepted by the CIA.On November 22, 1963, Florentino Aspillaga, a radio intercept officer with Cuban intelligence, went to work to do what he did every day\\u2013sit at a monitoring station outside Havana and listen for CIA transmissions from Virginia, Miami, and offshore ships. But on that day, the only time in a dozen years his routine was altered, he was ordered to stop monitoring CIA transmissions and instead listen to for communications coming out of Texas. A few hours later, he listened as news broke of the shooting of the President and reported it to headquarters. At the same time, the leaders of both the Soviet Union and Cuba just happened to be having meetings with westerners at the moment of the assassination who could credibly record their \\u201cshocked\\u201d reaction. As Pacepa writes: \\u201cFrom our KGB advisors, I had learned that the best way to put over a deception was to let the target see something for himself, with his own eyes.\\u201d\\u00a0Immediately, the intelligence services of the Communist world initiated one of their largest disinformation campaigns of all time: putting the blame of the Kennedy assassination on the United States government. Pacepa writes: \\u201cAs that very clever master of deception Yuri Andropov once told me, if a good piece of disinformation is repeated over and over, after a while it will take on a life of its own and will, all by itself, generate a horde of unwitting but passionate advocates.\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 118906}"
