Tests conducted on preliminary samples from the spill showed high bacteria counts despite the fact that the sewage had been treated, prompting the Health Department to install signs warning of contamination along access points to the river. The signs will be removed once further testing shows the waterway is safe. The DEH reported that the spill did not affect the ocean.Further north, the community of Oceanside has been plagued by sewage spills for years.
