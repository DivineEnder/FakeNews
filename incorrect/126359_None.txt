"{\"title\": \"'The East' Movie Review: Soft on Eco-Terrorism, Hard on Compelling Drama, Thrills\", \"content\": \"The East, a new film from screenwriter/actress Brit Marling, barely scratches what could be a pretty interesting surface. Instead, the so-called thriller skimps on motivation, explanation and depth, leaving a green drama that might make even anarchists pine for more.The setup sure grabs our attention. The East, a ragtag group of anti-corporate types, exist to punish businesses with a dollop of their own medicine. Poison the planet, will you? We\\u2019re going to poison you back.Enter Jane (Marling), a former FBI agent hired by a security firm to infiltrate the group. She listens to Christian music (a detail delivered early on and then ignored), has a loving boyfriend and will do whatever it takes to complete her mission.What she doesn\\u2019t expect is to bond with the anarchists, from live wire Izzy (Ellen Page), to the quietly charismatic Benji (Alexander Skarsgard, True Blood). Why wouldn\\u2019t she? These anarchists are adorable\\u2013when they play Spin the Bottle they ask for both kisses AND hugs. They also howl when the spirit moves them. And they\\u2019re lashing out at corporate types who purposely hurt people, or so the simple-minded narrative tells us.The East gives us flimsy back stories for our courageous anarchists, thumbnail sketches which don\\u2019t feel emotionally honest. Why don\\u2019t they just video some of the wrong doing and release it to both old and new media? Heck, just point a camera at that river with all the dead fish floating in it, and you\\u2019ve got a viral sensation. No, they have some anger in them, if not outright malice, but the emaciated screenplay can\\u2019t tell us why.Marling\\u2019s character would need two rewrites to be a cipher. Her boyfriend (Jason Ritter) is an afterthought, as is her faith, and her romantic arc is equally threadbare.Sarah\\u2019s entrance into The East also defies belief. She artfully scuffs her Birkenstocks to look the part, but then dyes her hair an appealing shade of blond to better fit in. She\\u2019s a master of disguise, all right.The\\u00a0East\\u00a0eventually gets around to showing these anarchists might not be as wholesome as apple pie crumbs found in a dumpster. By then, we\\u2019re hungry for more than just the film\\u2019s dramatic scraps.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 126359}"
