He was an asshole who planted a bomb made of jet fuel near a lab at the University of Wisconsin back in 1970. The bomb killed a young teacher named Robert Fasnacht, who had three kids.I bring this up because The Weekly Standard rightly nailed the Washington Post for its obituary headline describing Armstrong as a \\u201cVietnam War Protester.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nSterling Hall, University of WisconsinThe Standard says that\\u2019s like describing Major Hasan simply as a \\u201cFort Hood Psychiatrist.\\u201dThey\\u2019re right, but I would go further.It\\u2019s like saying Adolf Hitler was a regimented vegetarian.Or the Donner party enjoyed cold cuts.Or Lizzie Bordon was a cut up.Or John Wilkes Booth was a great actor.Or that Ted Kennedy was a lady killer.And Robert Byrd, a grand wizard of the KKK.whoa\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026.Yes it\\u2019s time for a Redeye Techno-apology! With techno music![Ed. Note: Please imagine the techno music. Better still, tune into RedEye tonight and hear the real thing.]\\n\\nHowever, it was done only to show how easy it is to pick one thing from a person\\u2019s history to gloss over or obscure the rest of his past. The point: the press suffers from Alzheimer\\u2019s of the spine \\u2013 that over time, they just seem to forgive and forget almost anything. That explains the romanticization of losers like Bill Ayers, and Armstrong \\u2013 as well as WTO protesters who somehow deserve a movie \\u2013 but their victims don\\u2019t.The love for the phony rebel allows for all sorts of violent idiocy \\u2013 witness Canada \\u2013 now with helpless police standing by as thugs destroy their cars.That\\u2019s the problem with so-called \\u201crevolutionaries:\\u201dIf you can\\u2019t beat them, you just joined them.And if you disagree with me, you\\u2019re a racist homophobe who plays soccer.Tonight a humdinger!Jim Norton!S.E.
