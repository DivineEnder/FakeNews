They\\u2019re all cracking up under the pounding of your brothers near the border of the Welayat [region].\\u201d He further gave updates about alleged victories in the outskirts of Mosul, where Iraqi forces admitted they met formidable resistance.Fighter Abu Talha Aljazrawi wrote: \\u201cThanks to Allah, we are confident in our sons the mujahideen. We are here deep inside the region of Ninveh, waiting impatiently for our turn to take part in jihad for Allah, the one and only. We swear in the name of Allah to parade the heads of the nonbelievers and Shi\\u2019ites in the center of Mosul. We\\u2019re not afraid and won\\u2019t let their airplanes frighten us. They have America on their side, we have Allah on ours.\\u201dThe app user who goes by the name of Mossab Almuhajer resorted to Islamic theology: \\u201cThe speech of Allah does not allow the men of evil to defeat the believers. We set up Allah\\u2019s faith on earth, but it is likely that Allah allowed evil to win because he wants to shame them, and wants to delay the victory of the believers to separate them [from the nonbelievers]\\u2026 We promise you will find us tomorrow on the ramparts of Baghdad\\u2026 You rely on the airplanes of the coalition, we are confident nothing can harm us, except what Allah has planned for us.\\u201dUsama Almaghrebi (\\u201cthe Moroccan\\u201d) wrote: \\u201cWe left our countries to fight for the victory of Allah\\u2019s faith\\u2026 Our brothers in religion and faith\\u2026 We\\u2019ve come here to fight for Allah and to fly his flag\\u2026 I swear to Allah that we\\u2019ll show them the strength they had never encountered\\u2026 I swear to Allah that the battle will be a disaster for them and they\\u2019ll be sorry for what they do\\u2026 We may lose Mosul or other places, but rest assured that the Islamic State is going nowhere, and will return stronger than ever. Look at the mujahideen from all over the world pledging allegiance to our caliph,\\u201d he said, alluding to reports in the pro-IS media that an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Africa pledged allegiance to IS and its leader Al Baghdadi.\\u201cSilencer\\u201d wrote: \\u201cI swear to Allah that we\\u2019re preparing for their arrival and arming ourselves and waiting for them inside Mosul\\u2026 Our brothers don\\u2019t allow us to go to the frontline because there are enough mujahideen out there. We regret not being able to take part in the fighting, but we are waiting for them with our explosive belts and with our APVs filled with explosives, we\\u2019re waiting for them to come to a battle that will go down in history.\\u201d\\u201cThey falsely claim that they\\u2019re advancing into the city in an attempt to boost morale among their troops, but they know that they\\u2019re lying and that they sustained many losses, and that many more are to come deep in Mosul. We\\u2019re ready and waiting for them. I swear to Allah that neither America nor any other country could help them. We will annihilate them. They will take Mosul only after all of us are killed in the name of Allah. The mujahideen are racing for places on the explosive car, they get on and shout: \\u2018I can smell heaven already!\\u2019 Can these people be defeated? No. I swear to Allah that the infidels will never defeat the believers.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 223789}"
