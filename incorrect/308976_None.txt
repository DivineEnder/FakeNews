"{\"title\": \"Hillary Clinton 'Health Conspiracy' Turns Out to Be Real\", \"content\": \"Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel even mocked those concerns in late August by having the former Secretary of State open a pickle jar on his desk. She used that appearance to dismiss any health concerns as \\u201cpart of the wacky strategy, just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you.\\u201dAri Rabin-Havt (who once falsely accused this author of being a Birther) mocked what he called \\u201cHillary health trutherism,\\u201d likening it to the Birther conspiracy theories about Barack Obama. On Aug. 21, he wrote: \\u201cLike the birthers of the Obama era, Hillary health truthers base their accusations on a convoluted mix of conspiracy theories, exaggerations and outright lies that forces believers to willfully ignore any evidence to the contrary while twisting themselves into logical pretzels.\\u201dMelissa Jeltsen, senior reporter for the Huffington Post, wrote\\u00a0on Aug. 26 that those raising questions about Hillary Clinton\\u2019s health were simply misogynists: \\u201cThe subtext of the rumors spouted by Trump and his crew of armchair doctors is clear: Clinton is biologically unfit to lead. She\\u2019s a woman, after all \\u2026\\u00a0Let\\u2019s get real: The wild conspiracy theories around Clinton\\u2019s health are a convenient way to mask misogyny inside \\u201clegitimate\\u201d medical concerns \\u2026\\u00a0That\\u2019s sexism, plain and simple.\\u201dComedian Sarah Silverman was more direct, saying that those questioning\\u00a0Hillary Clinton\\u2019s health were \\u201cfucking assholes.\\u201dNow that Clinton has been forced to take several days off the campaign trail after collapsing at the 9/11 Memorial on Sunday in New York, the truth is beginning to emerge: she\\u00a0has major health issues that even her supporters have long noticed.Some in the media, like Vox, still cling\\u00a0to the hope that it is all a conspiracy theory.But even Jimmy Kimmel had\\u00a0to admit Wednesday night: \\u201cYou know, these conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton\\u2019s health would be a lot harder to believe if they didn\\u2019t actually come true.\\u201dJoel B.
