"{\"title\": \"Trump Camp In Israel: We Still Support Him Despite Lewd Comments; He\\u2019s Not Running For Chief Rabbi\", \"content\": \"Marc Zell said that he and his five daughters will be voting for Trump, and maintained that the majority of the 200,000 registered U.S. voters in Israel \\u2013 half of whom are women \\u2013would still support Trump \\u201cwith all of his shortcomings.\\u201d\\u201cI\\u2019m saying he doesn\\u2019t need to [resign]. He did what he did. His comments are disgusting and absolutely unacceptable, we are against it,\\u201d Zell told Israel\\u2019s Army Radio. But \\u201che said he\\u2019s not perfect, he apologized.\\u201dHe added that there is \\u201cno chance\\u201d Trump will quit.According to Zell, Trump\\u2019s decade-old comments pale in comparison to Hillary Clinton\\u2019s offenses, not least of which are\\u00a0the leaked emails \\u2013 also released over the weekend \\u2013 showing her questionable relationship with Wall Street.\\u201cThe public wants Trump, with all of his shortcomings, over Clinton with her failures, her corruption, her lies,\\u201d he said.\\u201cI have five daughters and they will all, all, vote for Trump,\\u201d Zell added.As several GOP leaders announced the withdrawal of support for Trump following the audio\\u2019s release, Zell called on Republicans to band together.\\u201cI call upon all the Republican leadership, who understand like we do that we need a change to the White House immediately and undo eight years of damage caused by Obama and Clinton to the United States around the world \\u2014 to unite and to support the ticket, from the top to the bottom,\\u201d Zell said.Meanwhile, Trump\\u2019s campaign manager in Israel Tzvika Brot told Army Radio that it \\u201cwas good he regretted [his comments], but he isn\\u2019t running for chief rabbi. There are only perfect leaders in Hollywood.\\u201dBrot added that both Republicans and Democrats had not necessarily wanted both candidates as their first choice but despite this \\u201cthe parties are standing behind them.\\u201dA Facebook page for Republicans Abroad Israel called on supporters to stick by Trump.\\u201cWhen your team is under attack, you RALLY AROUND THE FLAG, YOU DON\\u2019T BURN IT AND RUN,\\u201d one posting read.Zell, an international lawyer based in Jerusalem, did not support Trump early in the campaign but later changed his mind. Zell maintains that among the reasons for his change of heart was witnessing Trump\\u2019s staggering success in the primaries \\u2013 winning 37 states to beat out 16 other candidates in the race.\\u201cFirst and foremost, the people have spoken, and they have spoken in an unequivocal fashion,\\u201d the Washington DC native told the\\u00a0Times of Israel in August.Zell also praised the Republican platform for dropping the notion of the \\u201ctwo-state solution\\u201d as an answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\u201cI\\u2019m against unrealistic policies. I am against trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. There\\u2019s no context in which a two-state solution in today\\u2019s world would work.\\u201dHe said the GOP nominee also deserved accolades for bringing topics that have been taboo in previous elections to the fore \\u2013 NATO, immigration and American trade agreements to name a few.\\u201cHere\\u2019s a guy who, just by the unorthodox manner of campaigning, introduced these topics into public debate. That\\u2019s fantastic. This shows already his ability to influence public opinion and to change the order of things,\\u201d he said.Zell, who is a Princeton graduate, praised Trump\\u2019s ability to detect the electorate\\u2019s ire over the current political establishment, the report said.\\u201cHe understood this, either instinctively or deliberately, and he tapped into that groundswell of discontent and rode it to (nomination) victory,\\u201d he said.\\u201cThe system needs to be shaken up, both domestically and in terms of foreign policy.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 308703}"
