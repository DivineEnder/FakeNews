"{\"article_id\": 123116, \"title\": \"Newsweek Elevates National Discourse: 'Obama's Critics Are Dumb'\", \"content\": \"It seems like only yesterday Newsweek was sold to the highest bidder for $1.00. Of course a sweetheart deal like that had to have a catch, in this case the buyer\\u2019s assumption of the liabilities on Newsweek\\u2019s balance sheet. In 2009 alone, Newsweek lost $30 million, most likely due to \\u201cjournalistic\\u201d  efforts  like this one:\\n\\nObama\\u2019s critics have gone from being racists to being just plain reckless. They see us as a gang of hayseed, Bible-thumping hicks clinging to their guns and religion while the most brilliant man ever to occupy the White House proceeds to turn America into a European-style democratic  socialist state. Sullivan believes Obama is so smart he may just outfox everyone:\\n\\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Andrew Sullivan, he is the  Editor of The Daily Beast and contributor to Newsweek. He is most recently notorious for being a Trig-Truther and the class-act that spun-off a piece about Sarah Palin\\u2019s presidential campaign negatives using Steve Job\\u2019s death:\\n\\nSullivan\\u2019s list of journalistic indiscretions and mind-numbing bloviating is so long and  undistinguished that even just publishing the headlines causes  irreversible loss of gray matter. I, your humble corespondent, have saved you from that fate.The good news is, as long as Newsweek keeps publishing stories like this, their survival is doubtful. Take a look at Newsweek\\u2019s financials and ask yourself how long this can go on.  Remember, the intended  audience  of this leftist rag is not terribly large, so one can hope that their decision to pander to that group with these inane ramblings will soon lead to their disappearance from the media landscape.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
