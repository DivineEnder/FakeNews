"{\"title\": \"European Parliament To Accuse Poland Of Undermining 'Constitutional Democracy'\", \"article_id\": 164900, \"content\": \"The resolution is the latest attack on Poland\\u2019s centre-right government for\\u00a0overhauling the Constitutional Tribunal \\u2014\\u00a0Poland\\u2019s highest court \\u2014 at the end of last year\\u00a0with reforms which critics allege\\u00a0remove checks on government power.The\\u00a0final text of the draft resolution criticising Poland was agreed on Monday by five of the European Parliament\\u2019s political groups \\u2014the European People\\u2019s Party, the\\u00a0Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left and the Greens/European Free Alliance.The widespread support from centrist and left groups means the resolution will\\u00a0likely be adopted. A copy of the draft, seen by EUobserver, will state that the European Parliament\\u00a0\\u201cis seriously concerned that the effective paralysis of the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland endangers democracy, human rights and the rule of law\\u201d.Other parts of the text add: \\u201cRecent events in Poland, in particular the political and legal dispute concerning the composition of the Constitutional Tribunal and new rules on its functioning \\u2026 have given rise to concerns regarding the ability of the Constitutional Court to uphold the constitution and guarantee the respect for the rule of law.\\u201dThe resolution will target\\u00a0both Poland\\u2019s Prime Minister, Beata Szyd\\u0142o, and President Andrzej Duda (pictured above when he nominated her as Prime Minister in November 2015)\\u00a0\\u2014 both members of the the county\\u2019s\\u00a0conservative\\u00a0Law and Justice party (PiS) which in Europe forms part of the\\u00a0Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group\\u00a0\\u2014 saying:\\u201cThe proceeding of the Polish government and the President of the Republic of Poland regarding the Constitutional Tribunal represents a risk for the constitutional democracy.\\u201dThe resolution will also\\u00a0refer approvingly to\\u00a0the European Commission\\u2019s new rule of law monitoring procedure which Breitbart London wrote about\\u00a0in January, calling on\\u00a0that body\\u00a0to issue a\\u00a0\\u2018Rule of Law Recommendation\\u2019 if Poland does not react in a way the MEPs deem acceptable.Were that to happen then Poland\\u2019s sovereignty would be compromised\\u00a0by being told to\\u00a0change its laws subject to\\u00a0monitoring from the European Commission. This is despite the PiS government being\\u00a0the first party to govern the country without coalition partners since the end of communism, following a general election result in 2015 which offended\\u00a0the\\u00a0left/liberal establishment across the continent.The ECR will present a\\u00a0counter-resolution declaring that Polish reform will \\u201cremain\\u00a0an internal matter for Polish\\u201d that \\u201cshould be carried out by the relevant national authorities\\u201d, continuing:\\u201cThis issue can be addressed properly only if all participants of the Polish political scene act responsibly and reach a compromise.\\u201dEUObserver\\u00a0reports that the\\u00a0ECR\\u2019s resolution stands no chance of being formally adopted by the European Parliament.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
