"{\"title\": \"Ninja Turtles & Anal Hygiene: A Second Open Letter to Nickelodeon\", \"content\": \"Re: Regarding Ninja Turtles and anal hygiene Dear Ms. Ariana Urbont,I want to applaud you and Nickelodeon for the courageous stand you took yesterday against bullying.\\u00a0Iam fed up with seeing Presidents and Vice Presidents of majorchildren\\u2019s broadcasters getting pushed around by \\u201cconcerned parents.\\u201d\\u00a0I think we all recognize that \\u201cconcern\\u201d is a red herring \\u2014 a pretext to excuse bullying. Does anyone believe these parents\\u2019 real concern is the loss of their 5 year olds\\u2019 innocence?\\u00a0Please.\\u00a0 A lesser VP would have concluded preserving, as the face of achildren\\u2019s show, a vicious and uniquely vulgar misogynist who publicly\\u00a0sexually humiliated a cancer survivor, MS victim and soon-to-be First Lady was an untenable position.\\u00a0After Jason Biggs not only made these remarks but went on to taunt those who objectedfor days afterwards, a woman of lesser character than you wouldhave found another front man she could present as a hero to\\u00a0kindergartners.\\u00a0 A lesser executive would have been concerned with saving her job orthe company\\u2019s reputation, but there is a principle at stake here.\\u00a0You can\\u2019t put a price on that.\\u00a0Somebody has to teach bullies a lesson, and for that I salute you.\\u00a0 If Nickelodeon can\\u2019t knowingly hire actors who publicly boast about hiring prostitutesto lead the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles without getting run off theair by \\u201cconcerned parents,\\u201d then what did all those soldiers die for?\\u00a0And if sexual assault isn\\u2019t hilarious, I don\\u2019t know what is. \\u00a0With that said, I do have some concerns you might not win this one.\\u00a0I don\\u2019t know if you know this, but there\\u2019s a war on women going on in this country.\\u00a0 Did you see the look in Megyn Kelly\\u2019s eyes when she reported this story on Fox News?\\u00a0 I\\u2019m not sure she\\u2019s going to let this one go.\\u00a0Like Michelle Malkin and Dana Loesch,Kelly has this thing about attractive, respectable, hard-workingmothers being subjected to nauseatingly sexist attacks for beingnon-liberals (I know, right? Take a joke! About your anus\\u2026).\\u00a0 I can understand how you might have misjudged how explosive this would be.\\u00a0This really could have gone either way.\\u00a0Sometimeschildren\\u2019s show stars hire prostitutes, sexually degrade women inpolitical attacks, teach kids about masturbation and anal bleaching ontwitter, and ridicule Christians for believing in God, and the wholething blows over in a couple days.\\u00a0 My professional advice going forward is to keep doing what you\\u2019re doing.\\u00a0Whileyou\\u2019re going to have to fire Biggs once Bill O\\u2019Reilly takes this up(it\\u2019s coming), it\\u2019s best to drag it out as much as possible.\\u00a0Youwant people to know how tough it is to determine where the line is andhow thoroughly you appreciate the moral nuances involved here. \\u00a0You also want people to know that it was only the fear of losingtheir money via advertisers that made you do it, not some sort ofindependent moral decision.\\u00a0This flatters them, and that\\u2019smuch more important than reassuring them they can trust your moraljudgment on behalf of their 5 year olds.\\u00a0 Also, think of all the publicity you\\u2019ll get!\\u00a0If you can hold out until the presidential candidates have to comment on it, TMNJ will be all the talk among every six year old in the country once they hear prostitutes and anal penetration are involved.\\u00a0They\\u2019ll be dying to watch the show and see what the fuss is about.\\u00a0Parents won\\u2019t be able to stop them.\\u00a0You can\\u2019t lose!Sincerely yours, Simon and Maria Templar\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 272531}"
