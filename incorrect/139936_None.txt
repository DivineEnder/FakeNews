"{\"title\": \"Sony Cancels 'The Interview' Theatrical Release\", \"content\": \"The cancellation, announced Wednesday, was a startling blow to the Hollywood studio that has been shaken by hacker leaks and intimidations over the last several weeks by an anonymous group calling itself Guardians of Peace.Sony said it was cancelling \\u201cThe Interview\\u201d release \\u201cin light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film.\\u201d The studio said it respected and shared in the exhibitors\\u2019 concerns.\\u201cWe are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public,\\u201d read the statement. \\u201cWe stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.\\u201dThe FBI is investigating the identity of the hackers, but suspicion has centered on North Korea, which previously issued warnings over \\u201cThe Interview.\\u201dEarlier Wednesday, Regal Cinemas, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark Theatres \\u2014 the three top theater chains in North America \\u2014 announced that they were postponing any showings of \\u201cThe Interview,\\u201d a comedy about a TV host (James Franco) and producer (Seth Rogen) tasked by the CIA to assassinate North Korea leader Kim Jung-un (played by Randall Park).Regal said in a statement that it was delaying \\u201cThe Interview\\u201d \\u201ddue to wavering support of the film \\u2018The Interview\\u2019 by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats.\\u201dSony had offered theaters the option of bowing out, and when so many of them did (other chains included ArcLight Cinemas, Cineplex Entertainment and Carmike Cinemas), it left Sony little choice for the release of \\u201cThe Interview.\\u201dOn Tuesday, the hacking group threatened violence at theaters showing \\u201cThe Interview.\\u201d The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday there was \\u201cno credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,\\u201d but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group. The warning did prompt law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles to address measures to ramp up security.Sony did not say what its plans for \\u201cThe Interview\\u201d now are, or whether the film\\u2019s release could potentially happen at a later date. Conjecture has centered on the possibility of an unprecedented on-demand release that would distribute the film without risk to theater operators. No wide-release studio film has ever been first released on VOD, out of protection of the theater business.With a modest budget of about $40 million, \\u201cThe Interview\\u201d was predicted to earn around $30 million in its opening weekend before Tuesday\\u2019s threats and the cancellation of its release. Should the film not be released theatrically, Sony would also lose tens of millions in marketing costs already incurred.A representative for the film\\u2019s directors, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, didn\\u2019t immediately respond to messages Wednesday.Sony\\u2019s announcement was met with widespread distress across Hollywood and throughout many other realms that followed what amounted to one of the most significant hacking attacks on a corporation.A former senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration said Sony made the wrong decision.\\u201cWhen you are confronted with a bully the idea is not to cave but to punch him in the nose,\\u201d Fran Townsend, Bush\\u2019s homeland security adviser, said Wednesday during a previously scheduled appearance in Washington. \\u201cThis is a horrible, I think, horrible precedent.\\u201d___White House reporter Darlene Superville in Washington and Film Writer Lindsey Bahr in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 139936}"
