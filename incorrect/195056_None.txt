"{\"title\": \"Al Qaeda-Linked al-Shabaab Arrests 100 Women in Somalia for Not Wearing Niqab\", \"content\": \"The BBC reports that al-Shabaab \\u201crounded up around 100 women and ordered them to comply with a strict Islamic dress code or risk being whipped.\\u201d The women were arrested in a market in Buale, a town southwest of Mogadishu. According to those reports, the women were detained for a short time and threatened with whipping should they not comply with al-Shabaab and wear a niqab \\u2013 the more involved head covering which leaves open only space for a woman\\u2019s eyes. The women, BBC reports, were released because it was their \\u201cfirst offense,\\u201d but they were warned that a second such arrest would result in physical abuse. Dress code for Islamist militants in the area, BBC adds, becomes more difficult to impose as the weather turns warmer, with summer heat reaching extremely high temperatures.Al-Shabaab has been attempting to overtake Somalia and neighboring countries since its major victories in southern Somalia in 2006. The National Counterterrorism Center describes the coalition as \\u201ca clan-based insurgent and terrorist group,\\u201d one that is not monolithic and often experiences disagreements and struggles for power among its leadership. In addition to conducting terrorist activity and threatening neighboring states, al-Shabaab is largely responsible for extreme conditions within Somalia, including the high threat of famine. The group often uses violence to prevent humanitarian groups from entering regions of the country that are plagued with famine and disease, exacerbating the threat of mass deaths in a nation in which 50,000 children are believed to be experiencing extreme hunger and famine.Despite its fragmented nature, it has been able to cause major disturbances through bombings and attacks on cities in Somalia and elsewhere. Most notably, al-Shabaab extended its targeting of the nation of Kenya in 2014. Kenya began targeting the group in Somalia in 2011 and in May returned to the country to attack key al-Shabaab locations, including one believed to be a residential compound, after a bombing in Nairobi killed twelve. Al-Shabaab responded to the attacks with threats that the group was redirecting its attention out of Somalia and to Kenya. \\u201cWe have transferred the war to inside Nairobi,\\u201d warned senior al-Shabaab official Fuad Mohamed Khalaf in a video released by the group. Khalaf promised Kenya \\u201cMuslim teenage suicide bombers, explosions and battles.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 195056}"
