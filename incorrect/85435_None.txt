And of course, Fox News and the National Review and all the right-wing outlets said, \\u2018Hey! You gotta watch this!\\u2019\\u201d Maher said.Maher read a tweet from the National Review\\u2019s Jonah Goldberg that said the segment \\u201ccorroborates\\u201d with Fox News\\u2019s reporting.\\u201cIt sure does, \\u2018cause it turned out to be total bulls\\u2014-!\\u201d Maher saidMaher then asked why there haven\\u2019t been retractions from the conservative media who promoted the interview, after it turned out to be a false account.\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t their story. This is on 60 Minutes to be incumbent upon them to check their sources. This was negligent to many degrees,\\u201d said Mattie Duppler of Americans for Tax Reform.However, the National Review\\u2019s Reihan Salam acknowledged that \\u201cThere are Republicans who really regret how the Benghazi story has unfolded,\\u201d adding it was a foreign policy failure.\\u201cThe problem is that congressional Republicans, they wanted a scandal. They were chasing a scandal rather than making a real foreign policy argument,\\u201d Salam said.\\u201cThey\\u2019re still chasing a scandal,\\u201d Maher replied.However, Salam said there was \\u201cpolitics on both sides\\u201d with the administration offering talking points and \\u201ca\\u2014\\u2014covering\\u201d by the Sate Department and CIA. Salam, who said that Republicans too, \\u201cmade the wrong call,\\u201d also thinks they \\u201cdon\\u2019t want to undermine\\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) because he is facing re-election.But when Duppler argued that there\\u2019s still questions about what happened, Maher interjected.\\u201cAs Hillary [Clinton] said, what possibly is the difference? Four brave Americans are dead at the hands of some people who think their god gives them permission to kill people. I don\\u2019t understand what we\\u2019re looking for,\\u201d Maher said.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
