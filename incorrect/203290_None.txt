"{\"article_id\": 203290, \"content\": \"Apple is notoriously bad at cloud services. Its MobileMe service, a collection of online tools, was a disaster and had to be canned. And, if you\\u2019ve ever tried to sync passwords across Apple devices, well: you probably already know what I mean. At least, that was the case for years. I haven\\u2019t had the balls to try recently.\\u00a0One of the reasons Apple bought Beats Audio was that Beats had a functioning cloud streaming service for music; Cupertino\\u2019s own developers have struggled for years to write software that actually works across its own range of devices.\\u00a0Consumers will be a bit more wary about syncing their photo libraries over the internet \\u2013 or even taking photos at all \\u2013 on their iPhones, after this. And yet I don\\u2019t think Apple should bear the brunt of the criticism. Why? Because it\\u2019s not just Apple services implicated, and because someone as famous as Jennifer Lawrence is negligent to the point of complicity by having snaps like that stored on internet-enabled devices.She is one of the most famous women in the world. She earns a fortune for, among other things, being hot. Is there a straight man on the planet who hasn\\u2019t \\u2013 if you\\u2019ll forgive my crudeness \\u2013 thought about what it might be like? Hell, I\\u2019m as gay as they come and even I\\u2019ve thought about it.\\u00a0That being so, it\\u2019s stunning, isn\\u2019t it, that no one in Lawrence\\u2019s support team thought to be more careful about content being uploaded to servers over which they have no control. It\\u2019s not hard to turn off syncing services, and there\\u2019s no reason why someone with Lawrence\\u2019s wealth can\\u2019t hire someone to do it. \\u00a0The other thing that strikes me is: she\\u2019s Jennifer Lawrence! Why does she need to take sexually explicit photos of herself at all? It\\u2019s not like she wants for male attention, and I find it hard to believe she\\u2019s posting them on dating sites or sending them via Snapchat. Other stars go to extraordinary lengths to get their rocks off while protecting their privacy.\\u00a0Let\\u2019s remember, malice and titillation are the currencies of the internet. Trolls and hackers live for attention and to humiliate other people \\u2013 especially famous people. It is skull-crushingly dumb to imagine you can have dirty snaps of yourself out there on the internet, or on some big Silicon Valley company\\u2019s servers, that will stay private forever.I don\\u2019t think, by the way, that \\u201ccloud computing\\u201d \\u2013 which is the name given to software that sits on the internet, instead of your computer, like Google Docs or business software such as Salesforce \\u2013 will be much damaged by the scandal. People don\\u2019t make the link between nude celeb photo scandals and web architecture.\\u00a0Perhaps they should: can any cloud company really say they do everything possible to avoid these kinds of leaks? Apple must bear some of the blame for the gap in its security that allowed this breach. I hope its CEO, Tim Cook, is writing a letter of apology to Jennifer Lawrence, and the other celebrities affected, as I type this.\\u00a0Then again, we shouldn\\u2019t be so conceited as to imagine there are hackers out there trying to get into our personal data. (With the exception of credit card details, obviously.) In the nicest possible way, your blurry photos from an Ibizan nightclub just aren\\u2019t that interesting to the rest of the world.\\u00a0What I think will be remembered from this mess \\u2013 and, by the way, there are more leaks to come, according to the hacker \\u2013 is how incredibly stupid the richest and most famous people in the world can be. Really the only thing you need to do, as a Hollywood star and global sex symbol, is make sure naked pictures of you don\\u2019t show up on the internet. Assuming, of course, that you don\\u2019t actually want\\u00a0them out there.\\u00a0There\\u2019s no evidence to suggest that\\u2019s the case with Lawrence. I\\u2019m sure she\\u2019s mortified. But we can all take a lesson from this. If you\\u2019re even a little bit famous, and you\\u2019re going to take pictures of yourself in a state of undress \\u2013 if you really, absolutely have to \\u2013 buy yourself a Polaroid camera and share them in person, in private.Because, if you don\\u2019t, chances are somewhere, some day, your nudie pics will get an audience far larger than you intended.\", \"title\": \"Who's to Blame for Nude Photos of Jennifer Lawrence Leaking?\", \"source_id\": 2}"
