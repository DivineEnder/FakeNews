"{\"title\": \"Leonardo DiCaprio Raped by a Bear in Fox Christmas Day Release\", \"content\": \"In an early scene in the gory survival-revenge film, DiCaprio\\u2019s character is mauled by a bear and left for dead. According to\\u00a0the Drudge Report, the bear flips DiCaprio onto his stomach and \\u201cthrusts and thrusts during the explicit mauling.\\u201d\\u201cHe is raped \\u2013 twice!\\u201d Drudge reported.Later in the film, DiCaprio is reportedly forced to slice open a horse and sleep inside its carcass to shelter himself from the elements.The Drudge Report included\\u00a0a link to an early audience report from the entertainment website Showbiz411, which claimed that the bear \\u201cdry humped\\u201d DiCaprio\\u2019s character.In an interview with Yahoo Movies last month, DiCaprio said that filming the bear scene was \\u201cpretty agonizing to do.\\u201d\\u201c[Those scenes] \\u2014 amongst many other sequences \\u2014 were some of the more difficult things I\\u2019ve ever had to do in my entire career,\\u201d the 41-year-old actor told Yahoo. \\u201cBut the end result is going to be one of the most immersive experiences audiences will ever have with what it would be like to come face-to-face with an animal of that magnitude that is incredibly primal. It is absolutely startling and shocking, and it is the closest thing to documentary filmmaking \\u2014 but in a completely stylized way that a lot of people never experienced.\\u201dAccording to\\u00a0The\\u00a0Hollywood Reporter, several audience members walked out of a pre-Thanksgiving Academy screening of The Revenant due to the violence. The\\u00a0film\\u2019s level of brutality could affect its award-season chances, as well as the award chances for Quentin Tarantino\\u2019s The Hateful Eight, if viewers and Academy members are put off by the violence.DiCaprio will look to take home his first Best Actor Oscar for his work in the film. He has previously been nominated three times for Best Actor (The Aviator, Blood Diamond, The Wolf of Wall Street) and once for Best Supporting Actor (What\\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape?)The Revenant is in theaters December 25.UPDATE: Fox issued a statement to Entertainment Weekly on Tuesday denying that a bear rapes DiCaprio\\u2019s character in the film: \\u201cAs anyone who has seen the movie can attest, the bear in the film is a female who attacks Hugh Glass because she feels he might be threatening her cubs. There is clearly no rape scene with a bear.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 293043}"
