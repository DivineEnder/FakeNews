"{\"article_id\": 348221, \"title\": \"Parker Sawyers Summons His Inner Obama\", \"content\": \"{\\\"In the new movie \\u201cSouthside With You,\\u201d asurprise hitat theSundance Film Festivalthis year, Parker Sawyers playsBarack Obamaback in 1989, when he had his first date with a young lawyer namedMichelleRobinson.\\\",\\\"In real life, Mr. Sawyers, 33, doesn\\u2019t even have an actors guild card. \\u201cI\\u2019d just been doing small parts before that,\\u201d he said on a recent afternoon. \\u201cIt was all new to me.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Sawyers, who grew up in Indianapolis and lives in London, said he received $15,000 to do the role, or maybe it was $20,000. \\u201cIt trickled into my bank account over a few weeks,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s less than I make for most of my voice-over work.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But money was not the point of doing the movie. The point was the exposure. And that is starting to come. During a recent stop in New York, he met with producers at \\u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\\u201d lined up a segment for \\u201cGood Morning America,\\u201d and auditioned for a pile of parts.\\\",\\\"Mr. Sawyers\\u2019s wife, Edita Ubartaite, who works with the U.K. Trade &amp; Investment department (\\u201cShe sends a lot of emails, I know that,\\u201d he said, when asked what she does for a living), requested that he bring her a gift, but he wasn\\u2019t taking it all that seriously.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI was like: \\u2018Buy you something? We live in London!\\u2019\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"So here he was at the end of a busy day, wandering the East Village in a black T-shirt, black jeans and black-and-red Air Jordans. He grabbed a bite at Cafe Orlin and walked into stores he never knew existed on streets he couldn\\u2019t name.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this called?\\u201d he said, cutting a right on St. Marks Place.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWho\\u2019s that?\\u201d he said, gesturing at a poster of Sid Vicious on a wall ofSearch and Destroy.\\\",\\\"As a child, Mr. Sawyers was gangly and excitable. His father,James Sawyers, who died in 2006, was a United States Navy veteran who served in Vietnam and was also a teacher and administrator; his mother,Paula Means (then Paula Parker-Sawyers), was the deputy mayor of Indianapolis from 1989 to 1991 under Mayor William H. Hudnut III, a Republican. She never crossed party lines until Mr. Obama ran for president in 2008.\\\",\\\"One night, when Mr. Sawyers was in high school, Ms. Means hosted a political fund-raiser at the family house and forced her son to stay in the basement, because of his dreadlocks. \\u201cI was a staunch Republican, and Indiana is five years late on everything,\\u201d she said in a phone interview. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t want my conservative friends to be exposed to dreadlocks!\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Sawyers said, \\u201cI was listening to a lot of Wu-Tang then.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Occasionally, Mr. Sawyers\\u2019s grandmother told him that if he didn\\u2019t get his act together, he was going to wind up in jail.\\\",\\\"It turned out Mr. Sawyers had an uncanny ability to remember conversations word for word and pick up people\\u2019s accents, the rhythms of their speech patterns and their gesticulations. All of which would come in handy later.\\\",\\\"Over the course of two hours with a reporter, Mr. Sawyers did spot-on impressions of his various relatives, Jack Nicholson, Michael Jackson (complete with moonwalk), President Obama and Matthew McConaughey.\\\",\\\"\\u201cLadies, ladies, ladies,\\u201d Mr. Sawyers said, stretching the words out as he grinded his hips like Mr. McConaughey in \\u201cMagic Mike.\\u201d\\\",\\\"It wasn\\u2019t until after Mr. Sawyers graduated with a degree in philosophy from Wabash College, a small liberal arts school in Crawfordsville, Ind., that he considered becoming an entertainer.\\\",\\\"First, he did catalog modeling and commercials for Subway and Gatorade. He considered going into public service, like his mother, but the fiction of movies was more appealing to him than the reality of politics. \\u201cSomething about beauty and art attracts me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPolitics is not so honest.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In the winter of 2014, one of his agents in London got a call about an independent film on the Obamas, centering on their first date.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe were looking at an actor represented by Parker\\u2019s agent, and that agent said, \\u2018You should also be taking a look at this other guy I represent,\\u2019\\u201d said the film\\u2019s director, Richard Tanne. \\u201c\\u2018We\\u2019ve been telling him for yearshe should play Barack Obama.\\u2019\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Sawyers sent in a tape of himself doing an impression of Mr. Obama.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt was like a \\u2018Saturday Night Live\\u2019 impersonation,\\u201d said Mr. Tanne, who was more interested in an interpretation of whom Mr. Obama may have been back when he was a student at Harvard Law School and Mrs. Obama (then Ms. Robinson) was his adviser atSidley Austin, the corporate law firm where they worked.\\\",\\\"Mr. Sawyers\\u2019s second audition tape was subtler. It got him a screen test in Los Angeles with Tika Sumpter, who had already been cast as Ms. Robinson. That summer, the group spent 17 days shooting in Chicago, where it was easy to see that Mr. Sawyers is unusual.\\\",\\\"One day, Mr. Tanne took Mr. Sawyers to brunch. When the check came, Mr. Tanne plunked down his credit card and the waiter took it away. A moment later, Mr. Sawyers rattled off 16 numbers.\\\",\\\"It was the credit card number.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe hadn\\u2019t even picked it up first to inspect it or anything,\\u201d Mr. Tanne said. \\u201cTwo weeks later, I said, \\u2018Do you still remember the numbers?\\u2019 and he spat them out without missing beat. So it is weird and also a little disturbing, but it all services the acting and it just shows you how hawklike his observational skills are. For someone who talks all the time, he\\u2019s deceptively observant.\\u201d\\\",\\\"After the movie screened at Sundance, Miramax and Roadside Attractions struck a $2 million distribution deal for \\u201cSouthside With You.\\u201d On Aug. 26, it will open in 800 theaters, a sizable gamble for a movie with a budget of about $1.5 million.\\\",\\\"The Obamas have not seen the film, Mr. Tanne said, but he seemed unworried. His agents at William Morris Endeavor, he said, had sent the White House an early draft of the script and heard nothing back.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe were just hoping it wouldn\\u2019t be met with disapproval, and it wasn\\u2019t,\\u201d Mr. Tanne said.\\\",\\\"The film is arriving at a fortunate moment. The president\\u2019s approval ratings arerising, and the first lady\\u2019s speech at the Democratic National Convention was a smash. As the Obama years draw to a close, even manycritics have acknowledgedthat his administration has been largely free of scandal and his family has comported itself impeccably.\\\",\\\"Mr. and Mrs. Obama\\u2019s relationship has struck others too, like David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker and the author of \\u201cThe Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cMarriage is a complicated thing, obviously,\\u201d Mr. Remnick said. \\u201cBut unless you are blinded by ideological or bigoted rage, how do you not see that family as somehow exemplary, even inspiring, considering the pressures of living in the bubble of the White House? At the same time, it\\u2019s a relationship free of sanctimony about itself. It\\u2019s wised up. It\\u2019s \\u2018I\\u2019m on to you, buddy,\\u2019 with a smile.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Remnick believes there will probably be a substantial number of people curious to see an enactment of the relationship\\u2019s beginnings, including the Obamas\\u2019first kissoutside a Baskin-Robbins in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago.\\\",\\\"As for Mr. Sawyers, he is focused on figuring out what the next thing is. He recently acted in a pilot for NBC that didn\\u2019t get picked up. He has even been perfecting impressions of other historical figures. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been working on Malcolm X,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd Michael Jordan. Just in case.\\u201d\\\",\\\"At 8 p.m., Mr. Sawyers had completed his neighborhood jaunt. During the walk back to his hotel, he and a reporter agreed to trade contact information. Though Mr. Sawyers had left his phone upstairs, he said there was no reason for him to write anything down. The reporter told him his number, and Mr. Sawyers said, \\u201cEasy enough.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The conversation shifted to movies, Mr. Sawyers\\u2019s children (Sophia, 7, and Winston, 4) and his father.\\\",\\\"Out of the blue, Mr. Sawyers rattled off a list of numbers. \\u201cThat\\u2019s your number backward,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Indeed it was. Twenty minutes later, the phone rang.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHi,\\u201d said the voice on the other end. \\u201cIt\\u2019s Parker.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
