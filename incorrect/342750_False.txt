"{\"content\": \"{\\\"LONDON \\u2014 A day afterDonald J. Trumpcalled for a ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States, much of the rest of the world on Tuesday looked at the American presidential election with a mix of befuddlement and despair.\\\",\\\"How is it, many wondered, that the same nation that twice put the black son of a Kenyan in the White House could now be flirting with Mr. Trump and his divisive, exclusionary stances?\\\",\\\"His remarks ignited widespread condemnation that crossed ideological and social lines in many countries.\\\",\\\"In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron, of the Conservative Party, dismissed Mr. Trump\\u2019s position as \\u201cdivisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France, which is still reeling from deadly attacks by Islamic extremists,wrote on Twitter: \\u201cMr. Trump, like others, fuels hatred,\\u201d and \\u201cOur only enemy is radical Islamism.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Responding to some of the blistering criticism on Tuesday, Mr. Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, steadfastly defended his proposal but said any ban would be temporary and would not apply to United States citizens.\\\",\\\"His comments were widely shared on social media throughout the Arab world. In a region racked by conflict, his language had an impact, including in Egypt, where he was condemned by the country\\u2019s highest religious authority and by many others, who called him an Islamophobe, a racist or, as Reem Khorshid, a 21-year-old engineering student and blogger, put it, \\u201ca madman who has no sense at all.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Rachid Tlemcani, a professor of political science at the University of Algiers, warned that Mr. Trump could push young people toward the Islamic State.\\\",\\\"\\u201cA lot of people in the Middle East think of the United States as the last place we can go if things turn really bad, as it is the place of freedom and liberty,\\u201d Mr. Tlemcani said. \\u201cI think that sort of comment could even invite some act of violence against America. I think he is not responsible.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But Mr. Trump\\u2019s position also had its admirers. His stance on Muslim immigration drew several hundred favorable comments on China\\u2019s Twitter-like social media site, Weibo, where supporters linked his idea to their own fears of theUighurs, a minority Muslim group in China\\u2019s northwestern region, some of whom have resorted to militancy and violence.\\\",\\\"The type of attention being paid to Mr. Trump stands in sharp contrast to the last time a presidential election in the United States riveted the world \\u2014 in 2008, when Barack Obama\\u2019s candidacy was widely embraced in other nations eager for what they viewed as a revival of American ideals. During that campaign, Mr. Obama was greeted by more than 200,000 people in Berlin, and his victorywas widely hailedas an affirmation of the best of America.\\\",\\\"As in the United States, Mr. Trump has incited particularly intense debate, not least in predominantly Muslim countries and in Europe, where far-right parties like Marine Le Pen\\u2019s National Front have been gaining ground by invoking anti-immigrant messages similar to those of Mr. Trump and where memories of 20th-century fascism still run deep.\\\",\\\"J.K. Rowling, the British author of the best-sellingHarry Potterbooks, evenmusedthat Mr. Trump was worse than the books\\u2019 arch-villain, Lord Voldemort.\\\",\\\"Charles Grant, the director of the London-based Center for European Reform, said Mr. Trump was anathema to many Europeans because his populism had edged toward fascism and conveyed a willingness to preach an open hatred of religious minorities that many far-right leaders, from Ms. Le Pen in France to Nigel Farage of the euroskeptic U.K. Independence Party in Britain, tried to temper as they fought to move their parties into the political mainstream.\\\",\\\"Mr. Grant added that Mr. Trump conveyed an ignorance of world affairs that Europeans found hard to stomach from a contender in a national election in the United States.\\\",\\\"\\u201cDonald Trump strikes me as a very different kind of populist right-winger than the kind we\\u2019ve grown used to in Europe in that he shows a complete ignorance about the world,\\u201d Mr. Grant said. \\u201cWhile Le Pen and others may say things that are alarmist, they at least acknowledge the premise of religious tolerance we\\u2019ve had in Europe since the 18th-century Enlightenment.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In France, which is grappling with the challenges of integrating a large Muslim population, the newspaper Le Monde called Mr. Trump\\u2019s comments \\u201cunprecedented.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But observers in France, where the National Front won the first round of regional elections last weekend, also noted that Mr. Trump reflected a familiar nationalist and anti-immigrant impulse, extending from Paris to Budapest. After the recent influx of migrants to Europe, many of them from the Middle East, Prime MinisterViktor Orbanof Hungary said that his country had a right to protect its Christian traditions by refusing to accept large numbers of Muslims.\\\",\\\"In La D\\u00e9fense, a business district west of Paris, In\\u00e8s Lessieur, 23, a student, said Mr. Trump depressed her. \\u201cI am sure he\\u2019ll get elected,\\u201d she said. Another student, Laura Albat, 20, responded, \\u201cNo, a country that voted twice for Obama cannot elect a man like that.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Some analysts, however, said that Mr. Trump\\u2019s views were more recognizable in Europe than most people liked to admit and that his stances resembled those of not just Ms. Le Pen but also other larger-than-life politicians who appealed to voters fed up with the political mainstream.\\\",\\\"\\u201cMany Italians think Trump is a sort of American version of Silvio Berlusconi, a big personality without the background of what it means to be a politician,\\u201d said Sergio Fabbrini, director of the school of government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \\u201cBoth are outsiders with a politically incorrect style, dividing American politics as Italian politics were divided.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In the Arab world, Mr. Trump\\u2019s anti-Muslim comments have yielded growing alarm, as many wonder what the approaching election could mean for the involvement of the United States in their region.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere is something disturbing about where the Americans are going in their relations with the outside world in general and with the Arab and Islamic world in particular,\\u201d said Abdulkhaliq Abdulla, a retired professor of political science from the United Arab Emirates. \\u201cAll of a sudden it seems that America, or at least some segments of America, have forgotten what America stands for.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Hafez Al Mirazi, the director of the Kamal Adham Center for Television and Digital Journalism at the American University in Cairo, contrasted Trump\\u2019s comments with the moment in 2009 whenPresident Obama spokein Cairo and attempted to reach out to the Arab and Muslim world, inspiring many with his personal story of success.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhat we are getting now is really terrible,\\u201d Mr. Mirazi said. \\u201cStuff that only the Ku Klux Klan and others would say.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Dar al-Ifta, the authority that issues religious edicts in Egypt, called Mr. Trump\\u2019s comments \\u201cextremist\\u201d and warned that they \\u201cthreatened societal peace\\u201d in the United States.\\\",\\\"Yet in a world in which terrorism has come to be associated with radical Islam, Mr. Trump\\u2019s stance resonated among people who perceive a similar threat.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHonestly, I support his ideas,\\u201d wrote one user of the Weibo social media service in China. \\u201cIf this guy could get in the White House, I hope he could do what he said \\u2014 stop the entry of Muslims.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, said Mr. Trump\\u2019s mentality of \\u201cmaximum security\\u201d struck a chord with many Chinese, who live in a highly conservative society.\\\",\\\"\\u201cActually, the Chinese could be the people who understand Trump the most,\\u201d Mr. Shen said.\\\"}\", \"title\": \"Trump\\u2019s Plan to Bar Muslims Is Widely Condemned Abroad\"}"
