"{\"title\": \"Report: Taliban Threatening Afghan Districts Secured by US \", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"The Long War Journal reports that the Taliban has already overran a district in northern Afghanistan.Last week, Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters that the American military in Afghanistan will not target Taliban jihadists in 2015 unless they pose a direct threat to the United States.\\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to target Taliban [members] simply by virtue of the fact that they\\u2019re Taliban,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo being a member of the Taliban doesn\\u2019t mean that the United States is going to prosecute operations against you for that reason alone.\\u201d\\u201cThat said, we\\u2019ve also been clear that a member of the Taliban who undertakes missions against us or our Afghan partners, by that act alone, renders himself vulnerable and liable to U.S. action,\\u201d Kirby added.Helmand province in southern Afghanistan has been one of the deadliest areas of the war for U.S. and Afghan forces fighting the Taliban. It is located next to Kandahar province, known as the birthplace of the extremist group.The United States military ceremoniously ended its combat operations in Afghanistan earlier this month, more than 13 years after the war against the Taliban started. U.S. and NATO troops pulled out of Helmand in October.\\u201cIn Helmand, the fighting has been heaviest in Sangin, where the insurgents remain within a mile of the government buildings in the district center,\\u201d reports The New York Times. \\u201cBut it has also been fierce in the districts of Musa Qala, Kajaki, and Now Zad in the north, and even, recently, in Marja District south and west of here \\u2014 an area that had been thoroughly pacified by United States Marines after a major push in 2010.\\u201dThe Times highlights a recent report authored by Coffey International Development, an independent consultant, showing that \\u201cby almost every measure Afghans in Helmand saw a worsening in corruption, security, government services, and delivery of justice since the departure of foreign forces.\\u201dThe Coffey report was commissioned by the international community.Helmand has long been\\u00a0considered a Taliban stronghold. The Taliban\\u2019s June and July offensive threatened the fall of both Sangin District and Musa Qala District, according to the Times.The Afghan security forces have suffered heavy losses in Helmand, \\u201cwith over 1,300 security force members killed between June and November,\\u201d the Times reveals.Corruption makes it difficult for authorities fighting to root out the Taliban.\\u201cOur own commanders sell our bullets to the Taliban instead of giving them to us, and then they buy a nice house in Lashkar Gah and stay there, leaving the little guys out there to do the fighting,\\u201d Samiullah, a policeman in Sangin who goes by one name told the Times.Nevertheless, the article notes that \\u201ceven without coalition support, Afghan forces have managed to beat back the insurgents and keep them from totally overrunning a district.\\u201dThe same cannot be said for a district in northern Afghanistan that is already under Taliban control.\\u201cJust one week after overrunning a district in the northern province of Jawzjan, the Afghan Taliban are now touting the existence of a training camp in neighboring Faryab province,\\u201d reports The Long War Journal.\\u201cThe jihadist group stormed the district of Khamyab in Jawzjan and forced Afghan security personnel to flee. The loss of Khamyab to the Taliban was confirmed by Fakir Muhammad Jawzjani, the provincial chief of police,\\u201d adds the Journal.According to the official data obtained by the Times, an unprecedented number (more than 5,000) of Afghan police and soldiers have been killed in the fighting throughout 2014.\", \"article_id\": 253326}"
