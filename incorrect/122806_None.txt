"{\"title\": \"EXCLUSIVE: O'Keefe Files Suit Against Al Gore's Current TV, Keith Olbermann, David Shuster\", \"content\": \"O\\u2019Keefe has not been charged with a felony, much less convicted of a felony, and he has not been accused of any inappropriate sexual or even physical contact. Both facts are a matter of public court record, and therefore the statements by Current TV, Olbermann and Shuster likely amount to defamation with actual malice.According to the complaint (after the jump):James told me over the phone, on the eve of his filing:\\nIt is abhorrent that Emmy award winners can contradict legal facts when citizen journalists are required to release full, unedited material \\u2014 which I have always done by the way \\u2014 to corroborate every claim that I make. I welcome criticism and even misguided hatred. But, if they call me a felon, if they call me a rapist, or any other disgusting, libelous, ridiculous thing, I will bring them into a courtroom, I will depose them, I will get access to their e-mails. I don\\u2019t care how many golden statues they have, I don\\u2019t care how many Emmies, Pulitzers they have. We will bring them to justice. chart pdf \\u2013 \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 122806}"
