"{\"title\": \"Inside the List\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Energy Explorer:The nature writer and environmental activist Terry Tempest Williams enters the monthly travel list (available online) with her look at America\\u2019s national parks,\\u201cThe Hour of Land,\\u201dnew at No.\\u202f3. One bright thread running through the book is Williams\\u2019s relationship with her father, John Tempest, a stoical, Teddy Roosevelt-style outdoorsman who shares his daughter\\u2019s love of wild places even as he revels in the company he founded to lay pipes for natural gas. \\u201cI\\u2019m proud of what we\\u2019ve done,\\u201d he tells her. \\u201cNot many men can say they\\u2019ve walked most of the major gas lines that fueled the American West\\u2019s development like I have.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Williams recently took a symbolic step into the energy industry herself, although it was too late for the book: In February, she attended a public auction held by the Bureau of Land Management in Utah, where she registered as Bidder 19 and \\u2014 inspired by the activist Tim DeChristopher, whose story she recounts in \\u201cThe Hour of Land\\u201d \\u2014 she purchased an oil and gas lease giving her the right to explore 1,750 acres of federal land for its energy potential. Perhaps understandably, auction officials questioned her sincerity.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou can\\u2019t define what energy is for us,\\u201d she told them. \\u201cOur energy development is fueling a movement.\\u201d Or as she put it in an interview with \\u201cDemocracy Now!\\u201d in which she confirmed she would spare the land from fossil fuel extraction: \\u201cIt\\u2019s stunning to realize that in our centennial year celebrating our national parks, our public lands, America\\u2019s public lands, are being sold for $1.50 an acre .\\u2008.\\u2008.\\u2008. There are white-tailed prairie dogs and Gunnison\\u2019s prairie dogs, which I happen to care enormously about, ferruginous hawks, pronghorn habitat, migratory flyway, sage, rabbitbrush. So we\\u2019re so excited to explore and see what kind of energy development, including the development of the movement, we can create.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Not With Her:One thing distinguishing the presidential campaign so far has been the lack of best sellers besmirching either candidate, but that changes this week with the arrival of Gary J. Byrne\\u2019s \\u201cCrisis of Character,\\u201d an anti-Clinton screed that jumps straight to the top of the hardcover nonfiction list. Byrne was a Secret Service officer who spent three years stationed outside the Oval Office during Bill Clinton\\u2019s presidency, from which vantage he says he saw lots of bad behavior. Among the book\\u2019s other claims is the suggestion that Hillary Clinton\\u2019s mistreatment of her Secret Service detail led some to drink too much and visit prostitutes. Interviewing Byrne on Fox News last month, Megyn Kelly was skeptical: \\u201cNow, come on. She drove the Secret Service to hookers?\\u201d\\\",\\\"Byrne hedged in his reply. \\u201cI\\u2019m not saying it\\u2019s her fault,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m saying that when you treat people like that \\u2014 \\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cThese are Secret Service guys!\\u201d Kelly said. \\u201cThey \\u2014 they\\u2019re tough.
