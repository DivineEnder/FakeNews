"{\"content\": \"{\\\"CLEVELAND \\u2014 Mike Hill, a black Republican state representative in Florida, grew steadily more disheartened as he watched television clips of his party\\u2019s overwhelmingly white national convention lecturing African-Americans about the police and race relations.\\\",\\\"There was Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, nearly shouting Monday night that the police only wanted to help people, regardless of race. A sea of white convention delegates, cheering wildly as two black speakers ridiculed the Black Lives Matter movement and unconditionally praised law enforcement officers. And a series of speakers pushing Donald J. Trump\\u2019s law-and-order message and arguing, as he has, that the United States had lost its way.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhen a lot of white Republicans get together and bring up race, even telling black people how they should see police and the world, it evokes the worst kind of emotion,\\u201d said Mr. Hill, who supports Mr. Trump but decided to skip the convention. \\u201cWe have so few black Republicans to begin with. Talking about race won\\u2019t bring us more.\\u201d\\\",\\\"For many black Republicans, the party\\u2019s convention has veered unexpectedly and unhappily toward lecturing and moralizing on issues of race, an off-putting posture at a time when Mr. Trump is staggeringly unpopular with minority voters. He drew support from zero percent of African-Americans in recentNBC News/Wall Street Journal pollsin Ohio and Pennsylvania, and he is struggling badly with Hispanics, partly because of his harsh language about Mexicans and immigrants.\\\",\\\"These Republicans said they had preferred the political messages to black voters at recent conventions, where the focus was less on public safety and crime than on economic opportunity, job creation, support for small businesses and school choice \\u2014 all issues, they said, that held appeal.\\\",\\\"In Cleveland, however, Mr. Trump and Republican Party leaders are focused on appealing to white voters, particularly white men who are critical to their electoral strategy in the Midwest and the South.\\\",\\\"Black Republicans said they understood the thinking behind this, but argued that it was based on politics more than on helping people or strengthening the country.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhen the Republican is getting only 5 or 6 percent of the black vote anyway, and the Democrat simply needs to say \\u2018I\\u2019m on your side\\u2019 to win the black vote, then what option do you have?\\u201d said Ward Connerly, a former regent at the University of California and a leader in national efforts to end affirmative action in college admissions. \\u201cYou support law and order. That will bring out a certain amount of support for a lot of Americans who are afraid because they see society as crumbling.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cPolitically, it\\u2019s a smart move to make,\\u201d Mr. Connerly added, \\u201cbut whether Republicans are solving the problems of the black underclass or not is another question.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Several black political figures and candidates skipped the event altogether. \\u201cHaven\\u2019t been watching,\\u201d former Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote in an email.\\\",\\\"And those who did speak from the podium seemed focused more on castigating black protesters, scolding other blacks for their behavior and exalting Mr. Trump than on trying to help Republicans make inroads with undecided or skeptical black voters.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSomebody with a nice tan needs to say this: All lives matter!\\u201d declared Darryl Glenn, a commissioner of El Paso County, Colo., who is African-American, in a line that drew a thunderous ovation from delegates.\\\",\\\"Mr. Glenn repeatedly struck a moralizing tone. \\u201cIf we really want to heal our communities, more men need to start stepping up and taking care of their children,\\u201d he said at one point. \\u201cSafe neighborhoods happen when fathers and mothers are in the home,\\u201d he said at another.\\\",\\\"The convention\\u2019s most prominent black speaker,Ben Carson, by contrast, suggested Tuesday night that Hillary Clinton was seeking to deceive poor blacks and other disadvantaged people.\\\",\\\"\\u201cShe would continue with a system that denigrates the education of our young people, puts them in a place where they\\u2019re never going to be able to get a job, where they\\u2019re always going to be dependent, and where therefore they can be cultivated for their votes,\\u201d Mr. Carson said. \\u201cThis is not what America is all about.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Though Mr. Carson and Mr. Glenn were enthusiastically received, their overtures to blacks seemed all the more discordant given the racial makeup of the audience in the convention hall here.\\\",\\\"This convention has fewer black delegates and speakers than any in two decades, according to several African-American Republicans who are regulars at party gatherings. The Republican National Committee could not provide definitive counts of delegates by race; one party official estimated that there were 80 black delegates, but that was based on an informal crowd count that might have included people on the convention floor who were not delegates. There are 2,472 delegates in all.\\\",\\\"Fred Brown, the chairman of the National Black Republican Council, said he had been going to Republican conventions since the 1970s and believed that this year\\u2019s convention was one of the whitest in memory.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe Republican Party has not done enough to enrich the party and create an opportunity for black members to become more involved,\\u201d said Mr. Brown, 80, who lives in the Bronx.\\\",\\\"Referring to Republican outreach to blacks, he said: \\u201cThey haven\\u2019t put the resources behind it to make that happen. The money should be there. It\\u2019s like we created the Southern strategy in the South, and right now we control the South because the Republican Party under Nixon put the money up. The same thing they did there, they could do with the African-American community.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Melanie Collins, a computer programming teacher from Cape May, N.J., who said she had been a Republican for a decade, said she felt alienated by the messages she had heard lately from Mr. Trump and other Republicans.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI would not have been part of a party if that had been their messaging all along,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s not a party that I would be in.\\u201d\\\",\\\"After wrestling with whether to support Mr. Trump, Ms. Collins said she would, but only in a transactional sense \\u2014 as if she were doing business with someone with a \\u201chorrible personality\\u201d because \\u201cyou had no choice.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The speech by Mr. Glenn, and Mr. Giuliani\\u2019s hand-wavingturn on the stage\\u2014 in which he seemed to condemn people who held negative views about the police \\u2014 were among several moments at the convention that unnerved some Republicans.\\\",\\\"Another came when David Clarke Jr., the sheriff of Milwaukee County, declared that \\u201cblue lives matter\\u201d and argued that the Black Lives Matter movement was contributing to \\u201ca collapse of social order.\\u201d He also praised the acquittal of one of the Baltimore police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray. (Efforts to reach Mr. Glenn and Mr. Clarke on Tuesday were unsuccessful.)\\\",\\\"\\u201cHow we talk directly about a community of people, and how we talk indirectly about a community of people, matters,\\u201d said Michael Steele, who was the first black chairman of the Republican National Committee. \\u201cRudy\\u2019s not living in their neighborhoods. And he doesn\\u2019t understand what\\u2019s motivating them.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Steele added, \\u201cThe coding, the language and the wording becomes a distraction.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Some Republicans said privately that they were uncomfortable that convention planners had tapped black speakers to chastise black protesters in front of a mostly white crowd, which seemed to lap it up. But others, like Mr. Brown from New York, said it was a \\u201cfarce\\u201d to say that African-Americans like Sheriff Clarke were being cynically used by Republicans to deliver stern rebukes to people of their own race.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe\\u2019s saying blue lives also matter to create a balance,\\u201d Mr. Brown said.\\\",\\\"Telly Lovelace, the national director for African-American initiatives and urban media for the Republican National Committee, said the party\\u2019s estimates indicated that this year\\u2019s convention was more diverse than the last two. Still, he said he had felt uncomfortable during some speeches, including Sheriff Clarke\\u2019s.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think Sheriff Clarke fully understands what those who live in urban communities, and particularly black men, have to deal with and have to go through, dealing with the police and being racially profiled,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI do believe that black lives matter. And Black Lives Matter is not this quote-unquote anarchist movement, as he described it in his speech.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 347563, \"title\": \"Black Republicans See a White Convention, Heavy on Lectures\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
