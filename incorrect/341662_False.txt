"{\"article_id\": 341662, \"title\": \"The Passion of Nicki Minaj\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Pop music is dominated almost exclusively by the female star \\u2014 Beyonc\\u00e9, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and, as always, Madonna. Engaging in a frantic, complex game \\u2014 crossing over many genres to keep up with the current caldron of hip-hop, electronic music and R&amp;B; signing sponsorship deals to make up for the lack of album sales; performing live everywhere from sheikhs\\u2019 parties to worldwide arenas \\u2014 these womenarethe pop business now, and they\\u2019re not feeling particularly shy about telling us that. Their primary message has become one of being the woman you actually have to be behind the scenes to succeed today: powerful, outspoken and in control.\\\",\\\"Nicki Minaj is the world\\u2019s biggest female hip-hop star, a top pop star and the first woman to achieve success in both genres. Like Beyonc\\u00e9, who performed recently in Central Park with the words \\u2018\\u2018boss\\u2019\\u2019 and \\u2018\\u2018hustler\\u2019\\u2019 flashing on screens behind her, along with a grainy video in which she smashed a vacuum and a sewing machine, Minaj has become expert at modeling the ways that women can wield power in the industry. But she has also drawn attention to the ways in which power can be embodied by a woman standing up for herself and speaking her own mind. Minaj\\u2019s behavior isn\\u2019t exclusive to her tracks; she also exhibits it in the national telenovela that she, like the rest of these women, to a greater or lesser degree, is running about herself, feeding the public information about her paramours, ex-paramours, peccadilloes and beefs, all of it delivered in social media\\u2019s short, sharp bursts.\\\",\\\"Perhaps you recall the three-act revenge drama that played out on various screens last month, as Minaj faced off against two major powers: Swift, the 25-year-old golden girl who may be the richest woman in music, and who spends time wholesomely baking cookies at her TriBeCa spread with a rotating cast of B.F.F.s; and Cyrus, the ex-Disney star who, more than five years ago, was extolling the virtues of purity rings but is now America\\u2019s pre-eminent \\u2018\\u2018bad girl.\\u2019\\u2019 She first recreated herself as a pornified star who wore gold grilles on her teeth and introduced the mainstream to \\u2018\\u2018twerking,\\u2019\\u2019 a dance originating in black circles in the South that involves shaking your buttocks, and more recently rebranded herself a \\u2018\\u2018happy hippie\\u2019\\u2019 and \\u2018\\u2018genderqueer,\\u2019\\u2019 neither male nor female.\\\",\\\"Pop stars today travel around with a small entourage, conducting their business from a mobile phone in the back of a climate-controlled luxury vehicle. And you can imagine these women in their cars when the nominations for MTV\\u2019s Video Music Awards, which long ago stopped judging musical quality and moved on to assessing the size of empires, were announced earlier this summer. The list did not include a nod in the top award category for Minaj\\u2019s wild video for \\u2018\\u2018Anaconda,\\u2019\\u2019 a song that samples Sir Mix-a-Lot\\u2019s \\u2018\\u2018Baby Got Back,\\u2019\\u2019 from 1992. The video features Minaj flipping the script to be the baby who has back, refusing to let her co-star, Drake, touch her buttocks and, somewhat frighteningly (for men) cutting up a banana that\\u2019s a clear metaphor for the snake in their pants.\\\",\\\"You can picture Minaj in her Maybach as she considered this particular affront and then used it to make a larger point. \\u2018\\u2018If I was a different \\u2018kind\\u2019 of artist, \\u2018Anaconda\\u2019 would be nominated,\\u2019\\u2019 she tweeted, followed by \\u2018\\u2018If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated,\\u2019\\u2019 and \\u2018\\u2018I\\u2019m not always confident. Just tired. Black women influence pop culture so much but are rarely rewarded for it.\\u2019\\u2019 (For the record, Beyonc\\u00e9 was nominated for the award in question, for a video in which she dances around in underwear and, inexplicably, a sweatshirt with the word \\u2018\\u2018KALE.\\u2019\\u2019)\\\",\\\"Swift, the good girl, herself nominated for a video featuring semiclad, slender women, jumped in next: \\u2018\\u2018I\\u2019ve done nothing but love &amp; support you. It\\u2019s unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.\\u2019\\u2019 (She quickly encountered media pushback and called Minaj to apologize.) But the free spirit Cyrus had something to say, too: A few weeks later, in this newspaper,she criticized Minaj\\u2019s commentsas lacking an \\u2018\\u2018open heart\\u2019\\u2019 and \\u2018\\u2018love,\\u2019\\u2019 adding that she didn\\u2019t respect Minaj\\u2019s statement \\u2018\\u2018because of the anger that came with it,\\u2019\\u2019 calling it \\u2018\\u2018not very polite\\u2019\\u2019 and continuing, \\u2018\\u2018Nicki Minaj is not too kind.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Soon, our characters gathered in the V.M.A. Thunderdome, where things that are not quite true are staged in a crude, middle-school-esque pageant, with players jockeying for time. And indeed, Swift and Minaj, having reached a truce, opened the show together. But later, as Minaj slinked onstage in a revealing dress that closely resembled gold filigree on a china cup to accept her award \\u2014 for Best Hip-Hop Video, which is not as important as Video of the Year: \\u2018\\u2018I saw [Cyrus] just looking at me, with her face screwed up, and I thought, What the!\\u2019\\u2019 she told me in mid-September, in the Trump hotel in Columbus Circle, while visiting New York for Fashion Week. Onstage, Minaj next did something exceedingly rare in the commercial music world. She addressed Cyrus with real venom \\u2014 \\u2018\\u2018This bitch that had a lot to say about me the other day in the press\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2014 and pointed at her with a manicured finger: \\u2018\\u2018Miley, what\\u2019s good?\\u2019\\u2019 MTV cut Minaj\\u2019s mike, but you could see her lips forming the words, \\u2018\\u2018Don\\u2019t play with me, bitch.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"A month later, the episode was still bothering Minaj. Addressing Cyrus, she told me: \\u2018\\u2018The fact that you feel upset about me speaking on something that affects black women makes me feel like you have some big balls. You\\u2019re in videos with black men, and you\\u2019re bringing out black women on your stages, but you don\\u2019t want to know how black women feel about something that\\u2019s so important? Come on, you can\\u2019t want the good without the bad. If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle, bond with us, dance with us, have fun with us, twerk with us, rap with us, then you should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us. You shouldn\\u2019tnotwant to know that.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Minaj stands abit over five feet tall, and as she padded around barefoot in her hotel suite, there was a tangle of shoes and outfits collected nearby that she had considered but rejected for Fashion Week. Outfits carefully sewn to the measurements of a six-foot-tall model with hipbones like handlebars don\\u2019t fit a shapely-all-over woman, and Minaj, like Kim Kardashian, favors garments with spandex in them. In the last 24 hours, she had poured herself into a nude mesh Alexander Wang dress that the most party-hearty 19-year-old would choose only as a beach cover-up; changed to a fire-engine-red two-piece zip-up suit for Wang\\u2019s after-party; danced at Jay-Z\\u2019s 40/40 Club in the Flatiron district for hours; hit the recording studio with her boyfriend, the Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill; then, finally, crawled into bed in the hotel on the Upper West Side at 7 a.m. She woke up at 3:30 p.m., changing into purple leggings and an oversize black T-shirt, though remnants of the night\\u2019s ensembles remained \\u2014 her hair swept up in a gun moll\\u2019s bouffant, a smidge shorter than Amy Winehouse wore hers; several diamond stud earrings crawled up her right ear like a series of buttons on the back of a Victorian gown.\\\",\\\"Minaj may have had a fair amount of influence over the fact that pop stars are constantly telling us they\\u2019re bosses, or they\\u2019re bitches, or they\\u2019re \\u2018\\u2018boss bitches,\\u2019\\u2019 which seems like a contradiction, or redundant, but is said without a trace of irony. A unique figure who draws 10-year-old girls as fans with her Technicolor wigs, sophisticated mimicry and playful attitude, Minaj also assumes a persona as aggressive, dis-happy and vulgar as any man in hip-hop. She electrifies tracks merely by appearing on them, from Kanye West\\u2019s \\u2018\\u2018Monster\\u2019\\u2019 in 2010 (\\u2018\\u2018First things first, I\\u2019ll eat your brains,\\u2019\\u2019 she explains) to the electronic dance music artist David Guetta\\u2019s \\u2018\\u2018Hey Mama,\\u2019\\u2019 with a video featuring her gyrating in a desert scene resembling Burning Man. She\\u2019s also the first woman to rise to the very top of the rap game not only as a star but also as a business entity. \\u2018\\u2018My wrists look like I am a jewel thief/But that\\u2019s just cuz I am a boss bitch/Now macaroni cheese and grill my swordfish,\\u2019\\u2019 she says in a song entitled, appropriately enough, \\u2018\\u2018Boss Ass Bitch.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"There\\u2019s nothing new about female artists struggling with issues of power and control, but we\\u2019re far today from the 1990s, when Queen Latifah proclaimed \\u2018\\u2018every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho/Trying to make a sister feel low/You know all that gots to go.\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018\\u2018Bitch,\\u2019\\u2019 in music, used to be an insult, a sneer, and it still can be. But female empowerment is a trend, and the word has been reclaimed \\u2014 by Minaj, in many a track; by Rihanna, in \\u2018\\u2018Bitch Better Have My Money\\u2019\\u2019; and triumphantly by Madonna, in her recent track \\u2018\\u2018Bitch, I\\u2019m Madonna.\\u2019\\u2019 This is good for business and either good for women or not good for women at all.\\\",\\\"In another era, Minaj\\u2019s sexuality, expressed semi-parodically \\u2014 pretending she\\u2019s a Barbie doll; glorifying women dressed as prostitutes and set in red-light-district windows \\u2014 might have given feminists pause. But in the 2010s, we have entered a different world in pop culture, one in which sexual repression is perceived as burdensome and perhaps even an inability to holistically integrate the body and self. Young people are identifying and exploring formerly unknown, or at least unlabeled, frontiers of sexuality and gender. And the fact that Minaj is in charge of her own objectification (describing her vagina with more words than I thought existed, and then amplifying its power by rhyming those words), as well as her own monetization (overt product placement in videos is a hallmark) has led most feminist voices to applaud her. But the writer Bell Hooks remains unimpressed, saying of \\u2018\\u2018Anaconda\\u2019\\u2019 at a New School panel titled \\u2018\\u2018Whose Booty Is This?\\u2019\\u2019: \\u2018\\u2018This [expletive] is boring. What does it mean? Is there something that I\\u2019m missing that\\u2019s happening here?\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"\\u2018\\u2018The frequency that Nicki works on is not the easiest frequency for us to wrestle with, because it\\u2019s about autonomy, and who has it, and whether we can actually tell the difference between self-objectification and self-gratification,\\u2019\\u2019 says Treva B. Lindsey, an assistant professor of women\\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at the Ohio State University, continuing: \\u2018\\u2018Do we even know what an autonomous female looks like in pop culture? What does control even mean in such a corporatized mass-media space?\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"On hip-hop radio shows, the dominant journalistic genre for the art form, Minaj speaks with a Queens accent, sometimes injecting it with Caribbean flair. But there was no evidence of that at the hotel, where she spoke in a night-after whisper that sounded like the hiss of a record before a song begins to play. \\u2018\\u2018I never was political or preachy, but I\\u2019d stop my show and do two minutes of talking to my girls, boosting them up,\\u2019\\u2019 Minaj said, sitting in a small, straight-backed chair upholstered in the light gray fabric ubiquitous in luxury hotels, Columbus Circle\\u2019s billboards pulsing in the background as dusk fell. \\u2018\\u2018They\\u2019d go home feeling, \\u2018Can\\u2019t nobody tell me [expletive].\\u2019\\u2009\\u2019\\u2019 And as her career went on, she realized she had more to say. \\u2018\\u2018We got so many girls right now having children and don\\u2019t even know the first thing to say to a child, but you\\u2019re having a child because \\u2018I want to keep this dude,\\u2019 or it just happened,\\u2019\\u2019 she explains on her second album. \\u2018\\u2018Why are we never in control? Why are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think it\\u2019s something wrong for waiting to have a baby, waiting until you\\u2019re 35 or 36 to have children? Technology has changed \\u2014 you can wait! Have something to offer them.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Minaj has a shockingly beautiful and complex face, with a wide, high forehead, dark, almond-shaped eyes and deep dimples on both sides of her cheeks that materialize when she smiles. But when asked if she felt confident in her looks as a kid, she said, \\u2018\\u2018Hell, no!\\u2019\\u2019 She paused. \\u2018\\u2018Now, I want to take steps to become more aware of who I am, what I like or dislike about my body \\u2014 why is that?\\u2019\\u2019 she said. She mentioned how insecure she felt on Instagram, \\u2018\\u2018where everyone is freaking drop-dead gorgeous.\\u2019\\u2019 Don\\u2019t get her wrong, she said: Like most celebrities, she approves the pictures that appear on her Instagram and other social-media accounts. \\u2018\\u2018I get that people put filters on their pictures \\u2014 I definitely use filters \\u2014 but I didn\\u2019t know peopleretouched,\\u2019\\u2019 she says, excitedly talking about being in a nightclub the other day, taking pictures with a friend, and how the friend \\u2018\\u2018cleaned all the sweat off our face\\u2019\\u2019 before she posted the photo. \\u2018\\u2018We\\u2019re in a club! We can have a moist, dewy-looking face.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"She laughs for the first time in our conversation, dimples popping everywhere, sun radiating through the room. \\u2018\\u2018People\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2014 famous people, she means \\u2014 \\u2018\\u2018are posting pictures of working out, and then there\\u2019s a change in their body\\u201d most likely from plastic surgery, \\u201cand they say it\\u2019s because they were working out!Ah-hahahaha.\\u2019\\u2019 Then she turns serious again. \\u2018\\u2018Back in the day, in hip-hop, the thick girl was glorified. Now the rappers are dating skinny white women. So it\\u2019s almost like, \\u2018Wait a minute, who\\u2019s going to tell the thick black girls that they\\u2019re sexy and fly, too?\\u2019\\u2009\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"One of Minaj\\u2019smost fascinating stylistic tricks as a performer has been incorporating alter egos, not only the Barbie doll (which she calls Harajuku Barbie) but Roman, an outspoken gay boy who lives inside of her. These alter egos, which have extensively detailed identities, seem exemplary of the way that women are forced to assume different personae to get through the day. But when I asked why she hadn\\u2019t called on them much on her last album, she gave me a vague answer about how they were only \\u2018\\u2018funny\\u2019\\u2019 and were still around somewhere. Early in her career, she also adopted Lady Gaga\\u2019s method of saturating the media with outrageous costumes, but now, when I asked if Gaga influenced her, she shot back, with a look of such intense disapproval my hair curled: \\u2018\\u2018I don\\u2019t even want to discuss that. That\\u2019s so old to me.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Minaj, tough in general, is known to be particularly tough with the press, like rappers tend to be. \\u2018\\u2018You have to be like a beast \\u2014 that\\u2019s the only way they respect you,\\u2019\\u2019 she said, in a soft-focus MTV documentary on her life, explaining that she walks out of photo shoots when there\\u2019s \\u2018\\u2018a $50 clothes budget and some sliced pickles.\\u2019\\u2019 She\\u2019s also guarded about her past, and much of her present. Born Onika Maraj in Trinidad in 1982, she moved to the United States several years later (her parents spent two years in the States before she arrived, trying to get settled). Minaj has long emphasized her difficult upbringing \\u2014 speaking openly about crack cocaine use in her home, in Jamaica, Queens, as well as domestic abuse and an episode when she says her father tried to burn down her house. But it\\u2019s difficult to reconcile those stories with the recent announcement that she\\u2019s developing a show about her youth for ABC Family. When I asked if her father abused her, she said: \\u2018\\u2018No. He was just abusive.\\u2019\\u2019 She continued: \\u2018\\u2018I would always hear him yelling and cursing, always. And it made me feel it was the way to interact, because that\\u2019s how I saw him interacting.\\u2019\\u2019 She said her parents\\u2019 marriage wasn\\u2019t a happy one. \\u2018\\u2018When I was younger,\\u2019\\u2019 she explained, \\u2018\\u2018I thought that the only reason my mother didn\\u2019t leave my father was for financial reasons.\\u2019\\u2019 She went on: \\u2018\\u2018From early on in my life, I looked at a woman not having her money as the biggest curse,\\u2019\\u2019 and then added, \\u2018\\u2018Now that I\\u2019m an adult, I realize that women stay whether a man\\u2019s rich or poor. It\\u2019s just a weakness.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Like Lady Gaga, who starred in plays while attending the Upper East Side\\u2019s Convent of the Sacred Heart, Minaj has drama-school chops. She studied theater at the Upper West Side\\u2019s LaGuardia High School \\u2014 the school from \\u2018\\u2018Fame\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2014 working on her freestyle rap skills in the lunchroom. After graduation, she waitressed at Red Lobster to make money and sang choruses on low-level rappers\\u2019 tracks. One day in a recording studio, she asked a local artist if she could write a rap. \\u2018\\u2018I wrote eight bars while he was in the booth, and he asked to hear it, but I was too shy. I said, \\u2018Can I just go spit it?\\u2019\\u2009\\u2019\\u2019 Minaj was in her neighborhood when she heard the song booming out of his car. \\u2018\\u2018He was playing it proudly, and that was my first indication \\u2014 maybe I\\u2019m good.\\u2019\\u2019 She began locking herself in her room for hours and hours with her beat CDs, she says. \\u2018\\u2018Eventually my mother would come in to check if I was alive.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Minaj\\u2019s darkest period may have started when she tried to make it in the men\\u2019s world of hip-hop, in about 2002. But when I asked for details, she said, \\u2018\\u2018I\\u2019m not approving or confirming anything you said.\\u2019\\u2019 A sketch for this time, then, begins when producers placed her in a group called the Hoodstars with three men, including Safaree Samuels, who would become her boyfriend of a decade; failing to secure a recording contract, Minaj began to rebuild herself as a solo act. In 2006, another producer, Big Fendi, christened her Nicki Minaj (\\u2018\\u2018Fendi flipped [my name] when he met me because I had such a nasty flow! I eat bitches!\\u2019\\u2019 she said, in an early interview). He reimagined her as the new Lil\\u2019 Kim. Kim, the Biggie Smalls prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9e, wore wigs, pretended to be a black Barbie and not only rapped about her genitalia but called attention to it in photo shoots that Minaj recreated. (At some point, Minaj also sold her mixtapes out of her white BMW 323i, a car she says she scrimped and saved to buy. I\\u2019m not sure when that was, because after I asked about it twice, she told me it was a dumb question.)\\\",\\\"Enticing big-name rappers to add a couple of bars to your tracks, or securing a guest spot on one of those rappers\\u2019 songs, is the way to build fame in hip-hop, and Minaj proved herself to be adept. She garnered guest verses from hip-hop royalty, including Lil Wayne. But her manager at the time, Debra Antney, who was born in Jamaica, Queens, before becoming an Atlanta hip-hop matriarch (and also the rapper Waka Flocka Flame\\u2019s mother), says, \\u2018\\u2018Nicki was the timidest little girl you\\u2019d ever want to see in your life \\u2014 she was so broken up, but she was so determined, all in one breath.\\u2019\\u2019 Timid? \\u2018\\u2018I used to have to scream at her: \\u2018You\\u2019re not going to sit here and cry, you\\u2019re not going to let nobody shut you down, that\\u2019s what you\\u2019renotgoing to do,\\u2019\\u2009\\u2019\\u2019 she says.\\\",\\\"Minaj knew with whom she preferred to be aligned, though he didn\\u2019t sign her until 2009: Lil Wayne, whose label, Young Money, is part of Cash Money, co-founded by Bryan Williams, known as Birdman. Wayne is \\u2018\\u2018a master of psychology. This guy has studied words. This guy is a poet,\\u2019\\u2019 she told Dazed magazine. She was marketed as a multigenre artist from the beginning, writing her own raps but also using the assembly-line process of pop. \\u2018\\u2018Nicki, with her theater background and ability to take on a range of accents, is extremely well suited to the way that pop music is made today, when the artist is a vocal actor not asked to say something that\\u2019s profound but rather play a role in a song that someone else has written,\\u2019\\u2019 says John Seabrook, author of \\u2018\\u2018The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory.\\u2019\\u2019 But building her as a brand, long a part of the culture of hip-hop, was \\u2018\\u2018the furthest thing from breezy,\\u2019\\u2019 says her manager, the Maverick management group co-founder Gee Roberson. Securing a fragrance deal, a Glu mobile game, an alcoholic drink \\u2014 all of that requires entering executive suites \\u2018\\u2018dominated by men.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"During her rise, Minaj didn\\u2019t publicly announce that she had a boyfriend \\u2014 she introduced Samuels to the world only as a valued producer, continuing the long tradition of sex symbols appearing sexually available to their fans. She has since changed her attitude about that, and has not been shy about being in love with her current boyfriend, Meek Mill, pointing toward the bedroom whenever his name came up tonight. He recently had his own beef, with Drake, Minaj\\u2019s labelmate, during which \\u2014 this is an abridged version \\u2014 Meek attacked Drake for using a ghostwriter, and Drake struck back with what seemed like an endless series of dis tracks, one of which asks, \\u2018\\u2018Is that a world tour or your girl\\u2019s tour?\\u2019\\u2019 That Minaj managed to stay above this is significant. \\u2018\\u2018Historically in hip-hop, female rappers have always had to stand next to a male rapper in order to maintain relevance, or keep their spark,\\u2019\\u2019 says Charlamagne Tha God, the outspoken host of the radio station Power 105.1\\u2019s program \\u2018\\u2018The Breakfast Club.\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018\\u2018What happened with Drake and Meek won\\u2019t have any effect on Nicki at all, and in fact I think Nicki is so strong that she\\u2019s one of the reasons people haven\\u2019t completely said Meek is done.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Minaj talked a bit about dealing with men and work. \\u2018\\u2018Since I was 15, I came out of one relationship and went into another relationship,\\u2019\\u2019 she told me. \\u2018\\u2018In my relationships, I\\u2019ve been told, \\u2018You don\\u2019t have to work that much.\\u2019 But I can\\u2019t stop working, because it\\u2019s bigger than work to me. It\\u2019s having a purpose outside any man.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"Meek\\u2019s beef withDrake was different from Minaj\\u2019s beefs with the pop queens. It was an old fight, about authenticity \\u2014 the oldest dust-up there is in hip-hop. Minaj is fighting newer battles. While discussing the state of women in the music business, I asked about the ethics of \\u2018\\u2018Straight Outta Compton,\\u2019\\u2019 the N.W.A. biopic that does not include a reference to Dr. Dre\\u2019s history of abusing women. \\u2018\\u2018I don\\u2019t know anything about that,\\u2019\\u2019 she said. Then I asked about the dramatic goings-on at her label: Wayne is suing Birdman for $51 million for withholding fees, and Wayne\\u2019s tour bus was riddled with bullets in Georgia earlier this year. A federal indictment claims that individuals connected to another Cash Money rapper, Young Thug, may be responsible.\\\",\\\"This was not the game Minaj was here to play \\u2014 interviews in the social-media era are about being adored, not interrogated. It was getting dark outside when I asked about Drake, Meek, Wayne and Williams. Minaj hadn\\u2019t turned on lights, so she was in shadow. \\u2018\\u2018They\\u2019re men, grown-ass men,\\u2019\\u2019 she said. \\u2018\\u2018It\\u2019s between them.\\u2019\\u2019 How does it make you feel, I ask? \\u2018\\u2018I hate it,\\u2019\\u2019 she said. \\u2018\\u2018It doesn\\u2019t make me feel good. You don\\u2019t ever want to choose sides between people you love. It\\u2019s ridiculous. I just want it to be over.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"\\u2018\\u2018Is there a part of you that thrives on drama, or is it no, just pain and unpleasantness\\u2014\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"The room went quiet, but only for an instant.\\\",\\\"\\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s disrespectful,\\u2019\\u2019 Minaj said, drawing herself up in the chair. \\u2018\\u2018Why would a grown-ass woman thrive off drama?\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"As soon as I said the words, I wished I could dissolve them on my tongue. In pop-culture idiom, \\u2018\\u2018drama\\u2019\\u2019 is the province of Real Housewives with nothing better to do than stick their noses where they don\\u2019t belong. I was more interested in a different kind of drama \\u2014 the kind worthy of an HBO series, in which your labelmate is releasing endless dis tracks against your boyfriend and your mentor is suing your label president for a king\\u2019s ransom. But the phrase I used was offensive, and even as I tried to apologize, I only made matters worse.\\\",\\\"\\u2018\\u2018What do the four men you just named have to do with me thriving off drama?\\u2019\\u2019 she asked. \\u2018\\u2018Why would you even say that? That\\u2019s so peculiar. Four grown-ass men are having issues between themselves, and you\\u2019re asking me do I thrive off drama?\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"She pointed my way, her extended arm all I could see other than the diamonds glinting in her ears. This wasn\\u2019t over yet. \\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s the typical thing that women do. What did you putting me down right there do for you?\\u2019\\u2019 she asked. \\u2018\\u2018Women blame women for things that have nothing to do with them. I really want to know why \\u2014 as a matter of fact, I don\\u2019t. Can we move on, do you have anything else to ask?\\u2019\\u2019 she continued. \\u2018\\u2018To put down a woman for something that men do, as if they\\u2019re children and I\\u2019m responsible, has nothing to do with you asking stupid questions, because you know that\\u2019s not just a stupid question. That\\u2019s a premeditated thing you just did.\\u2019\\u2019 She called me \\u2018\\u2018rude\\u2019\\u2019 and \\u2018\\u2018a troublemaker,\\u2019\\u2019 said \\u2018\\u2018Do not speak to me like I\\u2019m stupid or beneath you in any way\\u2019\\u2019 and, at last, declared, \\u2018\\u2018I don\\u2019t care to speak to you anymore.\\u2019\\u2019\\\",\\\"I found myself back in the lobby, with its Trumpian brass fixtures and huge chandeliers, with the black bikes stamped \\u2018\\u2018Trump Hotel\\u2019\\u2019 tied up in front, and the men in their blue suits coming down the steps jingling change in their pockets, and the regular Upper West Side scene \\u2014 bankers walking their dogs, tourists on Citibikes going the wrong way, the sound of an express train coming up through the subway grates. Minaj\\u2019s actions made sense, in some ways: Even though I had no intention of putting her down as a small-minded or silly woman, she was right to call me out. She had the mike and used it to her advantage, hitting the notes that we want stars like her to address right now, particularly those of misogyny and standing up for yourself, even if it involves standing up for yourself against another woman. I didn\\u2019t know how much of it Minaj really felt, and how much it was a convenient way of maintaining control. I only knew that, in that moment, she was a boss bitch.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
