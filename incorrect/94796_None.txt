Ours would have been the first to have done so.\\\"He added, \\\"What we did do, even though there was no requirement in Massachusetts for either the legislature or the executive to have done so, we provided 700 boxes to the archives...As to whether or not we should have electronic records also provided to the public, that's something for the legislature to consider.\\\"And this: \\\"The legislature could sort that through if they like.\\\"Given the influence of the Globe in the New Hampshire market, this is not a story that's likely to disappear anytime soon for the candidate, whose strategy hinges rather heavily on the Granite State.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
