"{\"content\": \"The incident was further compounded by the fact that the Egyptian contender, Islam El Shehaby, suffered a \\u201chumiliating\\u201d loss, the\\u00a0reports said.The articles, translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), slammed El Shehaby for ignoring pressure from anti-normalization proponents in Egypt and going ahead with the bout against Israeli judoka Or Sasson.Writing in Al-Ahram, Egypt\\u2019s largest news outlet, Hussein Al-Zanati said that El Shehaby\\u2019s refusal to shake hands with Sasson \\u201csent the world a negative message about Egyptian athletes, which was leveraged by the global Zionist propaganda machine to portray us all as extremists, uncultured, and unsportsmanlike.\\u201dAfter being defeated by Sasson, El Shehaby snubbed the Israeli athlete\\u2019s proffered hand and left the arena amid boos from the crowd, before the referee ordered him back to take a bow in accordance with the rules of judo.Days before the bout, Moutaz Matar, a TV host of the Islamist-leaning network Al-Sharq, had urged El Shehaby to withdraw.\\u201cMy son, watch out. Don\\u2019t be fooled, or fool yourself, thinking you will play with the Israeli athlete to defeat him and make Egypt happy,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEgypt will cry; Egypt will be sad; and you will be seen as a traitor and a normalizer in the eyes of your people.\\u201dIn his August 15 article, Zanati also made reference to Shehaby\\u2019s shaky policy of normalization.\\u201cThe question is: If Islam El Shehaby truly opposes normalization with the Zionists, why did he agree to fight the Israeli in the first place? And if he did so out of a desire to wage jihad against an \\u2018enemy\\u2019 and defeat him, then why wasn\\u2019t he better prepared to win?\\u201d\\u201cShould we cheer for him when he chose normalization with the Israeli enemy?\\u201d he added.Zanati concludes that it would have been \\u201cmore honorable\\u201d for Egypt had the judoka refused to participate.\\u201cBut to choose to compete, to suffer a humiliating loss, and then to want to become a popular hero [by refusing to shake hands] \\u2013 this is the embodiment of shame and an insult to our intelligence. Heroism means having principles and defending them, rather than trying to mock everyone and play both sides.\\u201dSimilarly, Egyptian intellectual Mamoun Fandy attacked El Shehaby for his refusal to shake hands in the London-based daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, arguing that the incident only served Israel:\\u201cThis refusal to shake hands produced a saying which has become one of Israel\\u2019s best propaganda messages: \\u2018Losing doesn\\u2019t make you a loser but hate makes you a loser.\\u2019 [With this] as proof, pro-Israel media have succeeded in portraying us as a culture of hatred,\\u201d he writes.Fandy lambastes elements of the Egyptian public who chose to cheer Shehaby on despite his defeat, arguing that portraying defeats as victories is part of a larger \\u201cvirus\\u201d in which \\u201cdelusional\\u201d Arabs present illusions as reality.\\u201cThis phenomenon is the most dangerous virus, which will quickly make Egypt not only a failed country, but a failed culture,\\u201d he writes.Fandy calls Judoka-gate \\u201ca double defeat.\\u201d The first is \\u201cthe defeat of a judoka who should have accepted his loss and not politicized it, and second, the propaganda defeat, which cost Israel no effort at all to achieve.\\u201dFandy also comments on the fact\\u00a0that \\u201c300 million Arabs were unable to produce a winner of medals like France, which has a population of no more than 70 million.\\u201d(Fandy is wrong in that there have been a handful of Arab medalists in Rio this year, including the Moldovan-born Emirati judoka Sergiu Toma who won the bronze for the men\\u2019s 81 kg.)\\u201cThe first step in treatment is to diagnose the disease. We are undoubtedly a diseased culture,\\u201d Fandy concludes.Immediately following the incident, Egyptian journalist Galal Nassar wrote: \\u201cAs long as you agreed to play an Israeli champion in the Olympics, you should have exchanged the greeting.\\u201dHe contended that Shehaby\\u2019s move backfired, and the Israeli player ended up with more sympathy. \\u201cWe have lost in terms of sports and politics,\\u201d Nassar said.\", \"title\": \"Egyptian Media: Our Judoka's Refusal To Shake Israeli's Hand Made Us Look Extremist\", \"article_id\": 311927, \"source_id\": 2}"
