"{\"content\": \"Media Matters is a propaganda outfit. Their 501(c)(3) status is a scam. They\\u2019re paid operatives whose donors really hate Fox News \\u2014 so much so that Media Matters violates their own \\u201cstandards\\u201d when deciding what is or isn\\u2019t worthy of attention.You\\u2019ve probably heard about Project Gunrunner / Project Fast and Furious. If you haven\\u2019t, here\\u2019s a quick synopsis by editor emeritus, Michael Walsh (via  NYP):\\n\\nAlso known as Project Gunrunner, the Arizona-based operation was supposed to be a sting, under which the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is part of the Justice Department, allowed \\u201cstraw purchasers\\u201d to transfer weapons from gun shops in Arizona to Mexican drug cartels to trace and halt crossborder arms-trafficking.That\\u2019s the official version, anyway \\u2014 but it\\u2019s crumbling,  fast.This is a scandal. An official US operation has gone terribly wrong. A Federal Agent and who knows how many Mexican civilians have been killed with these guns. Now we\\u2019re finding out that Justice Department officials might have been trying to cover up the botched operation (via  ABC News):\\n\\nMelson is the acting head of the ATF. More:\\n\\nYou\\u2019re getting the picture. There\\u2019s something rotten in the state of Denmark. So how does the propaganda outfit known as Media Matters cover the coverage (specifically the Fox News coverage) of this obvious scandal? Easy.  They characterize it as nothing more than a \\u201ccontroversial\\u201d government operation that Fox News is using to push a \\u201cconspiracy theory.\\u201d No curiosity regarding who authorized it. No. The problem with the story isn\\u2019t the story itself, it\\u2019s the commentators who are asking questions and speculating about whether there was some political angle to it. (Oh, and of course there\\u2019s a little  race-card playing in the mix \\u2026 for spice.)Apparently, it\\u2019s not okay to speculate about the potential political motivations behind allowing guns to flow into Mexico where no one would be able to keep tabs on them. According to Media Matters, there no chance someone might want to legitimize the claims made by some that  80% of the guns used by drug traffickers in Mexico come from the US. It is impossible to think someone might have thought they could control this situation and it went horribly wrong. Nah! It\\u2019s just those crazy right-wingers being all skeptical of government again. Totally unfounded. Stick to the facts, they say.Alright, let\\u2019s stick to the facts regarding another scandal which for some reason, Media Matters and their goons on Twitter can\\u2019t stop talking about:  The News of the World phone hacking scandal. Project Gunrunner, meh. News of the World, oh yeah!Now, to be fair, this was serious stuff. Apparently, someone at the tabloid decided it was a good idea to hack and gain access to thousands of people\\u2019s voicemail. It was an atrocious violation of privacy and downright disgusting. They reportedly targeted the voicemail of families of victims of the 7/7 terrorist attacks in London and the voicemail of a young girl who was murdered.According to the slime merchants at Media Matters, this is \\u201cMurdoch\\u2019s Watergate.\\u201d Remember, though, speculation is bad. Speculation is a tool used to spread misinformation. So let\\u2019s look at how Senior Fellow Eric Boehlert \\u2013 who seems to be the point man on this phone hacking scandal coverage \\u2013 opens up his article:\\n\\nPick your Watergate reference at will, but one thing is certain: The long-simmering phone-hacking story that has been hounding Murdoch for years took a dire turn this week for News Corp. and it suddenly has the possible makings of a career-defining debacle for the partisan media mogul. It\\u2019s a debacle that features Murdoch starring in the eerily similar role as the one Dick Nixon played.Hmm. That sounds like a lot of speculation and zero evidence to me. As you might imagine the rest of the article provides no evidence that Rupert Murdoch knew about the phone hacking scheme or that he authorized it. It\\u2019s a long attempt to equate Murdoch with Nixon at his worst. But hey, he\\u2019s the owner of FoxNews so Boehlert is free to smear him because Media Matters doesn\\u2019t have to live up to the standards it sets for FoxNews, or something. I guess when you\\u2019re engaged in a taxpayer subsidized war on Fox, you can also be a hypocrite. Must be nice.Media Matters has some sick, twisted priorities. Their full name is Media Matters for America. Why the hell are they focused on a British event? The answer, of course, is FoxNews. These cretins are so focused on making Fox the world\\u2019s super-villain, that they will intentionally downplay really important events in order to increase attention on the actions of a few people in England.They\\u2019ve even taken the speculation a step further and are now using completely unsupported allegations to lobby for congressional hearings into the phone hacking scandal happening in the UK. You read that correctly.  Congressional hearings:\\n\\nFor years, with your help, we\\u2019ve tracked the lies and deceit coming from Fox News. Now it appears that it\\u2019s not just Fox that\\u2019s the problem. The pattern of News Corp\\u2019s misbehavior goes much deeper\\u2013and even into illegal behavior. The British government is investigating and now the Australians are also calling for an investigation of Murdoch\\u2019s papers there.Americans also need to know whether our privacy was violated by Murdoch reporters searching for a good scoop to sell news. Ask Congress to hold hearings to see just how far this scandal goes-and whether News Corp\\u2019s record of breaching the public trust has affected us.Join our call for Congressional hearings here.\\nWe can\\u2019t rely on News Corp, with its record of mismanagement, to address the problem. We must take proactive steps to address protect our privacy from News Corp\\u2019s mismanagement. Murdoch\\u2019s cover-up is falling apart, with serious consequences for hacking victims and News Corp shareholders alike.With zero evidence themselves, Media Matters is basically accusing a News Corp executive of being involved in the phone hacking scheme. Suddenly, the hacking has become \\u201cstandard operating procedure\\u201d at News Corp. Worldwide. Based on nothing more than Media Matters\\u2019 overactive imagination \\u2013 or marching orders.Yet, when it comes to Project Gunrunner, Media Matters would rather try to discredit those asking for congressional inquiries into Eric Holder\\u2019s knowledge and involvement of the operation. Again, a phone hacking scheme in the UK warrants congressional attention, but a US government operation which has cost at least one federal agent his life is nothing more than a controversial program \\u201cright wingers\\u201d are making too much noise about. It\\u2019s sick.It wouldn\\u2019t be a big deal if 1) taxpayers weren\\u2019t subsidizing their activities and 2) if there weren\\u2019t other media outlets who picked up Media Matters\\u2019 talking points and ran with them (I\\u2019m looking at you MSNBC). If these guys want to engage in what I would consider anti-American propaganda, fine. Let them pay taxes like everyone else. I\\u2019m sure there are plenty of rich Leftists who would willingly donate to keep them afloat even if they didn\\u2019t get a tax break for doing so\\u2026 right?And now, right on cue, the Democrat establishment follows the narrative and starts the drumbeat to bring regulatory attention on News Corp to distract attention from real issues while \\u201cindependent\\u201d organizations like CREW demand, you guessed it, congressional hearings.I would speculate that there\\u2019s some coordination going on but that\\u2019s a no-no according to Media Matters.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"title\": \"MMfA PROPAGANDA WATCH: Forget Gunrunner Let's Focus On ...
