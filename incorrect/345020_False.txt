"{\"title\": \"Tough Re-election for G.O.P. Moderate Is Getting Tougher\", \"content\": \"{\\\"MANCHESTER, N.H. \\u2014  When SenatorKelly Ayotteis in Washington, she plows through the halls of the Capitol, her face pinched into an expression somewhere between suspicion and agitation, a human tuning fork of intensity.\\\",\\\"But from the moment the New Hampshire Republican rolls her carry-on bag to the airport gate for her flight back home, Ms. Ayotte\\u2019s face softens, her gaze broadens and she chats with half her fellow passengers, all of whom she seems to know \\u2014 lobbyists, college students, someone who has noticed her daughter\\u2019s basketball game has improved.\\\",\\\"She may not always telegraph it, but Ms. Ayotte, a freshman senator, is locked in a herculean battle with the state\\u2019s popular Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan. As one of five Senate Republicans running for re-election in states that supported President Obama in both 2008 and 2012, Ms. Ayotte is seen as particularly vulnerable this November, and is a major reason national Democrats, now on the short end of a 54-46 Republican majority, are optimistic about taking back the Senate.\\\",\\\"Six years ago, Ms. Ayotte was part of a Republican wave that swept Democrats out of power in blue states likeIllinoisandWisconsin, as well as swing states likeNew Hampshire. For Ms. Ayotte and other Republicans from that class, 2016 was always going to be a difficult year to run for re-election because more Democrats vote in presidential years. But with the possibility thatDonald J. Trump, the most divisive Republican presidential candidate in a generation, will be at the top of the ticket, the party\\u2019s task may be all the more arduous.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey have to find a way to keep Trump voters excited, and appeal to those who are offended by him,\\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor ofThe Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales Political Report. \\u201cThat is the tension they have to navigate.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Nowhere is that tension more apparent than in New Hampshire, a moderate state that also gave Mr. Trump one of his most critical victories in itspresidential primary last month. \\u201cNew Hampshire is one of the most competitive races in the Senate,\\u201d Mr. Gonzales said. \\u201cIf the cycle turns into a catastrophe for Republicans, New Hampshire will be one of the first states to fall.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Ayotte, like most of her Republican colleagues, stands with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, inopposing a confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee, inrefusing to reject Mr. Trumpshould he become the party\\u2019s nominee, and in opposing Mr. Obama. But on issues that appeal to moderate voters \\u2014 drug programs for addicts, clean power plants and the so-calledGang of Eight immigration bill\\u2014 Ms. Ayotte has often sided with Democrats. And that is likely to be a familiar strategy for some of her fellow Senate Republicans this year.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWith the potential for a polarizing nominee like Trump or Cruz at the top of the ticket, it will be more important than ever for Republican Senate candidates to cement their own identity and distance themselves when necessary,\\u201d said Brian Walsh, a longtime Senate campaign aide and Republican consultant, referring also to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \\u201cSenators in both parties have been successful in doing that in recent years, but you need to run hard and run your own race because the top of the ticket inevitably dominates the broader national political environment.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Other Republicans from the class of 2010 \\u2014 Senators Rob Portman of Ohio, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mark S. Kirk of Illinois \\u2014 have also found issues that could distinguish them from more conservative members of their party (for Mr. Portman, programs for drug addicts; for Mr. Toomey, gun safety; for Mr. Kirk,agreeing to hearingsfor Judge Merrick B. Garland, Mr. Obama\\u2019s Supreme Court nominee). Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is an exception; he has not strayed far from hisTea Partyroots in his campaign.\\\",\\\"Nationally, Ms. Ayotte had a similar image as a conservative, augmented by Sarah Palin\\u2019sanointment of heras a fellow \\u201cmama grizzly\\u201d during the 2010 campaign,her alliancewith Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on interventionist foreign policy views, and her numerous votes todefund Planned Parenthood.\\\",\\\"But in her home state, Ms. Ayotte, 47, the image is different.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe perception outside of here thatKelly Ayotteis part of theTea Partywas actually false,\\u201d said Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire. \\u201cShe is pretty much Judd Gregg in a skirt,\\u201d he said, referring to the moderate Republican senator and former New Hampshire governor who preceded Ms. Ayotte.\\\",\\\"Ms. Hassan, her opponent, is also a lawyer, and entered politics in 1999 when Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, now a Democratic senator, appointed her to a state education commission. One of her children has cerebral palsy, and she has said her quest to have him educated in a traditional school inspired her to seek elected office.\\\",\\\"Ms. Shaheen, her mentor, describes her as someone who \\u201chas shown she can work across the aisle.\\u201d And just as Ms. Ayotte has tried lately to play up her spirit of bipartisanship, Ms. Hassan broke with her party shortly after announcing her candidacy this winter when she said the federal government had to put in place a better screening process for Syrian refugees before she would allow any in New Hampshire.\\\",\\\"But more recently her message seems borrowed from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the winner over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire\\u2019s Democratic presidential primary.\\\",\\\"Trump and Sanders voters share \\u201ca pervasive feeling that the system is truly rigged,\\u201d Ms. Hassan said in an interview in her office in Concord. \\u201cPeople are very frustrated and angry, and have this sense that no matter how hard you work, you can\\u2019t get ahead and stay ahead.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Drawing a contrast with Ms. Ayotte, she said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve tried to lower costs of higher education; I froze tuition\\u201d at the public universities. \\u201cWhile we were working so hard to do that, my opponent voted for deep cuts to Pell grants. She protected tax breaks for big oil. She voted to defund Planned Parenthood six times.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The state\\u2019s economy is doing well \\u2014 the unemployment rate last month was2.7 percent. A bigger issue is drugs. Almost 50 percent of state residents know someone who has been affected by opioid abuse, according to aWMUR/University of New Hampshire poll.\\\",\\\"Both Ms. Hassan, who managed to expand the state\\u2019sMedicaidprogram under the Affordable Care Act despite a Republican legislature, and Ms. Ayotte, whohelped push through a bill this monthto address the crisis nationwide, have tried to raise their profiles on the issue.\\\",\\\"Because New Hampshire is a small state, elected officials and political rivals like Ms. Ayotte and Ms. Hassan often find themselves at the same events.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHi, everyone,\\u201d Ms. Ayotte said breezily, strolling from table to table at a St. Patrick\\u2019s Day charity dinner in Manchester. Just as she settled down at a table, the governor rose to make a mildly awkward joke about how Ms. Ayotte\\u2019s plane might have been late, but a pilot change could not be made because \\u201cit\\u2019s up to the American people to decide\\u201d how to replace him.\\\",\\\"The joke, a reference to Ms. Ayotte\\u2019s insistence on not voting on a Supreme Court replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, drew nervous laughter and some boos, but underscored what Democrats hope is a high card in a contentious battle.\\\",\\\"\\u201cPeople know both of us,\\u201d Ms. Ayotte said. \\u201cShe has been the governor, and I have been the senator. And, of course, the presidential election is an important one, but people here are going to be able to distinguish and look at our race on its own.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 345020}"
