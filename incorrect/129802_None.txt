ISIS also used this strategy when Ferguson, MO, erupted after the death of Michael Brown. The Washington Post inserted English tweets from ISIS supporters who reached out to the blacks and promised equality in Islam:Experts have contradicted these claims of racial solidarity.\\u00a0For almost a year, Nigerian radical Islamic group Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS. A U.S. intelligence officer told NBC News in February that ISIS will not likely team up with Boko Haram in any official capacity due to the group\\u2019s racism against black Africans. ISIS allegedly accepted the alliance in March after many defeats in Iraq and Syria. Boko Haram changed\\u00a0its name to the \\u201cIslamic State West Africa Province\\u201d (ISWAP) in April, but there is still no absolute confirmation the groups are working together.ISIS hijacked numerous hashtags since they burst into the international spotlight in June 2014. The terrorist group took over hashtags associated with the 2014 World Cup, the biggest sports tournament in the world. Supporters and fighters posted gruesome pictures labeled with #Brazil2014 and #WC2014. Pictures also showed militants playing soccer with heads, while other posts attempted \\u201cto persuade other Western Muslims to join their ranks.\\u201d While gruesome, experts were impressed by their use of social media to promote their group.\\u201cThe slick nature of ISIS media releases has undoubtedly allowed it to become somewhat the \\u2018celebrity\\u2019 actor within the international jihadist community,\\u201d explained Charles Lister, terrorism expert at the Brookings Doha Centre. \\u201cOn social media, not a day goes by without a foreign supporter \\u2013 from London, to Mogadishu, to Manila \\u2013 expressing their support and allegiance to ISIS\\u2019s cause.\\u201dThe terrorists also hijacked the Napa earthquake hashtags #napaquake and #napaearthquake in August. On February 22, the anniversary of the game when America defeated the mighty Soviet Union hockey team in the 1980 Winter Olympics, militants posted propaganda under #MiracleOnIce and #HockeyDayInAmerica. The tweets mainly wanted to remind the world the terrorist group is still around.Americans struck back a few times. Last August, ISIS used #AmessagefromISIStoUS to send out warnings of impending attacks. Americans countered with posts under the hashtag to show the militants they are not scared and America will always win.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 129802}"
