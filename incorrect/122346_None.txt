"{\"title\": \"Exclusive: Jonah Goldberg - Piers Morgan's 'Hostile' Interview 'Proved the Point' of My Book\", \"content\": \"In my mind, at least, that\\u2019s the only explanation for Piers\\u2019 abysmal behavior. Jonah Goldberg isn\\u2019t some kind of political flamethrower, he\\u2019s a\\u00a0respected\\u00a0columnist and writer out on a tour to talk about his new book, and Piers treated him like he was a hack spokesperson for the RNC.\\u00a0 Piers wasn\\u2019t a host interested in his guest\\u2019s new book, he was a bitter partisan\\u00a0who had a series of pro-Obama talking points to get out \\u2014 I guess in the hopes of salvaging Obama\\u2019s fumbling of the bin Laden football he intended to spike \\u2014 and Jonah was the closest Republican handy to berate with them. Via email, I asked Jonah what he thought of those 12 minutes:\\nI don\\u2019t mind hostile interviews, but his questions were aimed at winning shabby little debating points bereft of substance.Indeed. When Piers asked Jonah how much he thought\\u00a0the bin Laden raid cost, I about fell out of my chair. On Twitter, Piers spent part of this morning attempting to defend his performance and declare his defeat a victory. He even offered to have Jonah on again, but Goldberg sees through that:\\u00a0I don\\u2019t know if the invitation to come back is sincere, and I\\u2019m not really sure if I care. But I think it\\u2019s clear that if he felt like he came out the winner of the exchange he wouldn\\u2019t be inviting me back.Anyone who watches boxing knows that it\\u2019s never the guy with his hand raised in the air who immediately demands a rematch. Unlike Piers, I\\u2019ve actually\\u00a0read Jonah\\u2019s book and what was most ironic was watching the CNN host prove many of the book\\u2019s central themes true. The Left isn\\u2019t interested in honest debate. Instead they engage in all kinds of passive-aggressive rhetorical tricks to win the moment.\\u00a0This irony wasn\\u2019t lost on Jonah either:The funny part is that the interview begins with me saying that liberals hide their ideological biases with false claims of moderation and centrism. He then proceeded to prove my point, over and over again.Right now CNN is a dying network\\u00a0and Piers Morgan is down 14% this month and wasn\\u2019t doing all that well last month. What happened last night is a symptom of CNN\\u2019s bigger problem, and that\\u2019s that they hide behind a dishonest shield of objectivity that only serves to insult the intelligence of the Left and Right. You can\\u2019t build an audience while\\u00a0sandbagging conservatives\\u00a0like Jonah, making partisan fools of yourself\\u00a0like Soledad O\\u2019Brien has, or\\u00a0selling your soul\\u00a0to\\u00a0aid Obama\\u2019s racially divisive re-election campaign. For all of its flaws, at least second-place MSNBC doesn\\u2019t attempt to hide the fact that it\\u2019s deep in Obama\\u2019s tank. If CNN wants to slow its collapse, I suggest they either come out of the ideological closet and become \\u201cMSNBC 2: Not Quite As Crazy,\\u201d or actually attempt to do objective reporting instead of doing what they are now, and that\\u2019s regularly proving themselves to be \\u201cThe Most Dishonest Name in News.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 122346}"
