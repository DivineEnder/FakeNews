By the moneyed 1980s, however, it had became the horological equivalent of a 60-foot Chris-Craft, an emblem of macho swagger appropriated by bonus babies and rappers.\\\",\\\"Lately, however, gold watches are moving beyond the pages of the Robb Report, and catching on with a more street-smart crowd.\\\",\\\"Call it a revival. Call it a reclamation. Just don\\u2019t call it bling.\\\",\\\"Jay Z wore a stately Jaeger-LeCoultre Tribute to 1931 Reverso in pink gold with his elegant black tie to the Grammys in February. John Mayer, a noted watch enthusiast, has been seen in a jumbo rose gold Audemars PiguetRoyal Oak.\\\",\\\"A further sign that gold is striking a new chord was Apple\\u2019s announcement of a top-of-the-lineApple Watch Edition, a smartwatch priced up to $17,000, in \\u201cjaw-dropping, beautiful 18-karat gold.\\u201d\\\",\\\"True, like leather pants, a gold watch is a statement, and wearing one takes a certain attitude to pull it off. But that willingness to court a higher reward by higher style risk is one reason some young professionals, like Blake Egan, a software salesman in San Francisco, are deciding that there is life after stainless steel.\\\",\\\"To Mr. Egan, 30, a gold Rolex Day-Date (the \\u201cTexas Timex\\u201d once favored by oilmen) was like something his father had worn. \\u201cThat was Lyndon Johnson\\u2019s watch,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd Don Johnson\\u2019s watch in the first season of \\u2018Miami Vice.\\u2019 \\u201d\\\",\\\"Then, last April, Mr. Egan decided he loved the look of an 18-karat Rolex Submariner with a blue dial, the quintessential power watch. He invested $27,000 in one, and was surprised by the reaction. Ordinary citizens were glancing at his wrist. Flight attendants cooed.\\\",\\\"Now he counts two rose-gold Patek Philippes (a Patek 5205R and 5167R) in his collection. \\u201cIn less than a year, I went from not being sure on a full gold watch to being hooked on them,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Retailers are noticing a healthy business in gold timepieces, too.\\\",\\\"\\u201cA couple of years ago, there was some resistance to wearing something like that on your wrist,\\u201d said Michael Gordon, the director of the Tourneau TimeMachine store on East 57th Street in Manhattan. \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t want to seem ostentatious at work.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But nowadays, he said, young Wall Street types are increasingly drawn to subtly elegant pieces by, say, Vacheron Constantin or Breguet, many of which are available only in gold or platinum, as a means of adding panache to a standard business suit.\\\",\\\"Yes, there are hazards. Consider the blinding resplendence of Reza Farahan, the flashy real estate agent on Bravo\\u2019s \\u201cShahs of Sunset,\\u201d who is seen on the show pairing a glimmering yellow-gold Rolex Daytona with his shiny suits and fuchsia power ties.\\\",\\\"Indeed, for those who can\\u2019t help thinking of a King Tut exhibition when they see yellow gold, a subtler rose gold can be the perfect first step.\\\",\\\"There was a rush on rose gold at last month\\u2019s Baselworld watch and jewelry fair in Switzerland. Rolex, for example, made a statement about rose gold\\u2019s sporty potential with theEverose and black Yacht-Masterwith an Oysterflex rubber bracelet (at the unsporting price of $25,000). The Apple Watch is available in rose gold, too.\\\",\\\"At more terrestrial prices, David Sokosh, the founder ofBrooklyn Watches, a boutique watchmaker in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, sells two models in rose gold-coated stainless steel, for $1,150 and $1,395, for retro-minded heritage types on a budget.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI associate rose gold with the 1930s, the 1940s,\\u201d Mr. Sokosh said. \\u201cIt feels classic, feels like fedora hats and old cars, like going on an ocean liner with a steamer trunk.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
