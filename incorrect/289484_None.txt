The Secret Service spox just repeatedly refused to confirm a single word of what you reported. https://t.co/1nQ2iVUBVp\\u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) March 29, 2016Name the agent, @dmartosko. He'll surely testify in court, anyway, right? So confidentiality isn't an issue. https://t.co/1nQ2iVUBVp\\u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) March 29, 2016Martosko replied that he would protect the anonymity he promised to his source \\u2014 and that the agency did not speak for that individual.@seanmdav I'm not obligated to name sources to whom I've promised anonymity. And you're confusing an agent with the agency.\\u2014 David Martosko (@dmartosko) March 29, 2016\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 289484}"
