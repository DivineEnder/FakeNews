Shy teenage girls took pictures beside grinning American soldiers while Polish families clambered over a line of Stryker armored vehicles.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI am very worried and afraid about whatRussiamight do next,\\u201d said Urszula Wronko, 69, a retired postal worker who watched in a bright red jacket and beret from a nearby stone bench, her shaggy dog squirming happily in her lap. \\u201cIt gives us all comfort to see these American soldiers and to know they are here for us.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, commander of United States Army forces in Europe, said the idea for Operation Dragoon Ride \\u2014 part public relations event, part training exercise, part shot across the Russian bow \\u2014 came to him slowly, over several months.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere was not a burning bush kind of moment,\\u201d the general said.\\\",\\\"He had watched, with growing concern, as President Vladimir V. Putin staged one mass military training exercise after another, ostentatiously demonstrating how rapidly Russian troops could move across the European frontier. He noted that ordinary Poles and others were growing increasingly anxious aboutRussia\\u2019s intentions as the long conflict in Ukraine dragged on.\\\",\\\"And then a British friend decided, as a training exercise, to move a company of soldiers deploying to North Africa overland across France and Spain rather than flying them.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThese things were banging around in my mind,\\u201d General Hodges said, just as a three-month deployment of American troops in the Baltics andPoland, part of a continuing series of joint training exercises known as Atlantic Resolve, was coming to an end.\\\",\\\"Normally, the American equipment would be loaded aboard rail cars and shipped in the dead of night while the soldiers flew back to their base inGermany.\\\",\\\"But General Hodges thought, this time, they would drive the 120 armored vehicles, one lumbering mile after another, accompanied by more than 500 American troops.\\\",\\\"And not just drive, but take a meandering, 1,100-mile trek through six countries, stopping in towns and villages along the way to mingle with local people and reassure allies by showing that the American military\\u2019s presence was more than a rumor.\\\",\\\"It would also, he said, further demonstrate \\u2014 \\u201cto Russians and anyone else\\u201d \\u2014 that the American military was just as capable of moving quickly across great distances, in its case even across national borders.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe wanted them to see that we can do this, too,\\u201d the general said.\\\",\\\"By the time it is finished, Operation Dragoon Ride, which began a week ago in the Baltics and is due to conclude later this week, will be the longest such movement the United States Army has made across Europe since Gen. George S. Patton diverted his Third Army to relieve Bastogne, Belgium, in 1944.\\\",\\\"And so, a nylon canopy was set up over a lectern beside a display of Polish, American and European Union flags in Drawsko Pomorskie, a town of 12,000 in northwestPoland. A Polish squad stood at attention in the courtyard outside the local cinema \\u2014 \\u201cCinderella\\u201d was playing, and \\u201cFurious 7\\u201d was due in a couple of weeks \\u2014 beside two groups of American soldiers, saluting smartly as both nations\\u2019 anthems blared on a loudspeaker.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe political situation in Europe is very uncertain at the moment,\\u201d Mayor Zbigniew Ptak told the troops. \\u201cSo your presence here gives us a real sense of security.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The Chinooks made their first pass over the ceremony, drowning out the mayor\\u2019s speech and whipping the regimental flags.\\\",\\\"\\u201cMaybe this show of strength will mean that there will be no war at all,\\u201d said Urszula Sobczyk, a biology teacher, as she tried to keep her phalanx of 17-year-old boys in order. \\u201cBut I must say, I am very worried these days.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Capt. David Engoren \\u2014 whose Third Squad of the Second Cavalry Regiment (nicknamed \\u201cDragoons\\u201d) was completing its three-month deployment and would join the convoy the next morning for the remaining 560-mile drive back toGermany, via theCzech Republic\\u2014 looked with empathy at the squirming teenagers.\\\",\\\"\\u201cLooks like they got \\u2018volun-told\\u2019 to be here,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Captain Engoren said he was a little shocked when he first heard, several months ago, about the plan, envisioning the endless logistical hurdles. But now that it\\u2019s underway, he is increasingly excited about the adventure and what it might accomplish.\\\",\\\"Among other things, the ambitious movement will serve as \\u201ca spur ride\\u201d for the soldiers.\\\",\\\"It is an important moment for a cavalry soldier to \\u201cearn his spurs,\\u201d he explained. The tradition goes back at least to the westward expansion of the United States in the 19th century. For riding into battle, troops earn their \\u201cgold spurs.\\u201d For making a long journey, like this one, they earn their \\u201csilver spurs,\\u201d as those taking part in this ride will.\\\",\\\"They are actual spurs, Captain Engoren said, that are prized and worn on special regimental occasions, often with the vintage Stetsons recognizable from old John Ford films.\\\",\\\"Hundreds of locals had turned up earlier in the week to greet the Americans in the larger city of Bialystok in northeast Poland, some bringing gifts of cake and vodka to the troops. \\u201cThe pictures looked like scenes from France and Holland in 1944,\\u201d General Hodges said.\\\",\\\"All along the slow route through rural lanes and divided highways, Poles have emerged and waved to the passing vehicles. \\u201cNot one person has given us the finger yet,\\u201d the general said.\\\",\\\"That may have changed Sunday when the convoy hit theCzech Republic, where opinion is split on the question of NATO versus Russia. While hundreds of Czechs greeted the convoy warmly when it passed into the country, a contingent of anti-NATO protesters was also in evidence.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been considering blocking the roads but eventually decided to stage a protest in Prague outside the base where the U.S. soldiers will be staying,\\u201d said Jiri Vyvadil, a former Social Democrat member of Parliament who has become a leading pro-Russian voice in the country. \\u201cI will come with a banner that says, \\u2018Czechs against NATO.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d\\\",\\\"No such attitudes were on public display in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland \\u2014 countries that consider themselves much more directly at risk of future Russian aggression. Nor was it the dominant opinion in the Czech Republic. Indeed, a group of Harley-Davidson riders met the American convoy at the Czech border to escort it through the country.\\\",\\\"In the school parking lot in Drawsko Pomorskie where the Americans had set up their Stryker vehicles for public inspection, Andrzey Matuzak watched from his battered blue bicycle.\\\",\\\"Mr. Matuzak, 59, a former border guard during the communist years in Poland, was wearing a smart set of American camouflage fatigues. But he expressed surprise when asked if he had dressed up especially for the occasion.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI wear these all the time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI just happened to be riding by when I saw the helicopters.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Marcelina Klimczak-Bolewicz pushed her 8-month-old daughter, Paula, in a covered stroller up the ramp of one of the Stryker vehicles while her 3-year-old son, Karol, casually inspected the heavy armaments.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYes, it makes me feel safer to see the Americans here like this,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s not enough. We need more and more of them. I am very afraid of this conflict and what might happen to these little ones. Who knows what Putin might do?\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
