"{\"content\": \"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan\\u2014Pakistan said it has begun building a fence along its border with Afghanistan, a move that could further rile relations between the two countries, each of which blames the other for harboring terrorists.Kabul doesn\\u2019t recognize hundreds of miles of Pakistan\\u2019s mountainous northwest border, which was drawn up under British colonial rule.\\u00a0Pakistan in February closed the border for \\u201csecurity reasons\\u201d for more than a month, to protests from landlocked Afghanistan, reopening it on March 20.Militants from Pakistan have relocated in Afghanistan and use its territory to stage attacks into Pakistan, Islamabad says.Conversely, Kabul says Pakistan has been for years sheltering the Afghan Taliban and the allied Haqqani network, a concerned echoed by Washington.Pakistan has decided it needs to do more to try to close off it porous border with Afghanistan.Much of that border on the Pakistani side is made of up of the tribal areas, a wild buffer zone where the regular laws of Pakistan don\\u2019t apply. Pakistan\\u2019s army chief, Gen. \\n      Qamar Bajwa, \\n       visiting the border Saturday, said construction of a fence has begun in the Bajaur and Mohmand parts of the tribal areas\\u2014both frequent crossings points for Pakistani militants.\\u201cA better managed, secure and peaceful border is in mutual interest of both brotherly countries who have given phenomenal sacrifices in war against terrorism,\\u201d Gen. Bajwa said in a statement.Pakistan is reeling from a recent wave of terrorist attacks that have left more than 100 dead across the country\\u2014including a suicide bombing in February at a shrine in the south of the country that killed dozens. It\\u00a0blamed the attacks on militants based in Afghanistan.Kabul said the problem isn\\u2019t the border.\\u201cBuilding a fence will not help solve the problem, but will only create more tension,\\u201d said Gen. Dawlat Waziri, a spokesman of the Afghan ministry of defense. \\u201cTo counter terrorism, Pakistan needs to deny sanctuaries to terrorist groups, stop financing, training and helping them\\u2026that\\u2019s something that would help stop terrorist attacks.\\u201dWashington long has alleged that Pakistan\\u2019s military backs the Taliban as a proxy in Afghanistan, where Islamabad fears the influence of its rival India. Pakistan denies the charge of official support but does sometimes acknowledge the presence of the Afghan Taliban on its soil.Kabul and U.S.-led coalition troops also acknowledge the presence of Pakistani militants in Afghanistan. The Pentagon said Saturday that a U.S. airstrike earlier this month had killed Pakistani militant Qari Yasin in the eastern Afghan province of Paktika.\\u201cThe fence will have an impact, definitely, but to extract the maximum benefit from this exercise, both Afghanistan and Pakistan have to sit down and work out a joint counterterrorism strategy for either side of the border,\\u201d said \\n      Muhammad\\u00a0Amir Rana, \\n       head of the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, a think tank in Islamabad.The U.S. commander in Afghanistan, who described the security situation there as a \\u201cstalemate,\\u201d has asked the administration of President \\n      Donald Trump\\n       for thousands more troops.In addition to the fencing, Pakistan had been trying to tamp down trouble on the lawless border region through renewed military operations in the tribal areas, which were a sanctuary for Afghan, Pakistani and al Qaeda jihadists. Islamabad is working on legislation that will integrate the tribal areas more fully into the rest of Pakistan.On the other part of the Afghan border, which runs along the southern Afghanistan province of Kandahar, Pakistan has in recent years dug a trench hundreds of miles long to try to prevent criminals and militants circumventing the official border crossing.\\u2014 \\n      Habib Khan Totakhil\\n       in Kabul and Qasim Nauman in Islamabad contributed to this article.Write to Saeed Shah at saeed.shah@wsj.com\", \"article_id\": 349645, \"title\": \"Pakistan starts building fence along border with Afghanistan      \", \"source_id\": 22245}"
