"{\"title\": \"Is 'Son of Hamas' A Fraud?\", \"content\": \"Last year, a man named Mosab Hassan Yousef was on tour to promote his new book, \\u2018Son of Hamas\\u2019 and to tell the story about his amazing conversion from Islam to Christianity; he was even touted as someone instrumental in rescuing Israelis from Hamas. Making Mosab\\u2019s story even more compelling was the fact that he is the son of a Hamas founder \\u2013 Sheik Hassan Yousef \\u2013 who disowned Mosab over the alleged conversion.During an interview on Sean Hannity\\u2019s television show last year, Mosab said:\\n\\nWhile Mosab was giving speeches at universities and churches, a former Muslim terrorist who once belonged to the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) \\u2013 Walid Shoebat \\u2013 was busy translating the Arabic statements of Ground Zero mosque Imam \\u2013 Feisal Abdul Rauf \\u2013 into English. What he found was a man who preached \\u201ctolerance\\u201d and \\u201cinterfaith dialogue\\u201d to western audiences, Sharia Law and Jihad to Arabic ones.Shoebat has done it again. He has now found the words of Mosab Hassan Yousef in Arabic and insists that they are not the words of a convert to Christianity. In fact, says Shoebat, Mosab\\u2019s objective appears to be the infiltration of western Churches in order to get them to actively work against Israel.\\n\\n\\nAfter translating Mosab\\u2019s interviews on two separate Arabic-language programs, Shoebat quotes the Son of Hamas as saying:\\n\\nDuring one of the interviews \\u2013 on YouTube \\u2013 Mosab can be seen wearing a kaffiyeh around his neck. This is very significant because it is a garment that shows solidarity with the Palestinian cause, which is vehemently anti-Israel. Fast forward to the 3:00 mark to see the host introduce Mosab\\u2019s book followed by a video feed of the Son of Hamas author.\\n\\n[youtube FKj7oNkshUo]On Shoebat\\u2019s website there is audio of another interview with Mosab \\u2013 subtitles included \\u2013 in which Mosab explains to a caller and the Arabic speaking audience that they should never report incidents of known terror activity to Israeli officials, only to the Palestinian Authority.If these findings are accurate, Mosab Hassan Yousef\\u2019s book should have had a slightly different title.Ben Barrack is a talk show host on KTEM 1400 in Texas and maintains a website at benbarrack.com\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 266120}"
