"{\"content\": \"{\\\"WASHINGTON \\u2014 Last November, when President Obamaproposed strict rulesto prevent broadband companies from blocking or intentionally slowing down the web, Republicans pounced on what they called yet another heavy-handed liberal proposal. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas pronounced the regulations \\u201cObamacare for the Internet.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But what was, on the surface, a simple fight over big government versus small has put Republicans in the awkward position of aligning themselves with the cable giants, among the most maligned industries in the country, against the sad Netflix viewer waiting for \\u201cHouse of Cards\\u201d to break through its \\u201cbuffering\\u201d vortex.\\\",\\\"In the intervening weeks, politics on the so-called net neutrality issue have shifted so much that House and Senate Republicans arecirculating legislationthat would ostensibly do exactly what the president wants: ban the blocking or \\u201cthrottling\\u201d of web traffic and prohibit the creation of paid \\u201cfast lanes\\u201d for Internet content providers willing to pay for faster delivery.\\\",\\\"But it would also prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from issuing regulations to achieve those goals \\u2014 the approach favored by the Obama administration and most Internet companies.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe ground has shifted,\\u201d said Chip Pickering, a former Republican House member now lobbying for small Internet service providers who support net neutrality regulations. \\u201cRepublicans lumped net neutrality in with the carbon tax and Obamacare: \\u2018He\\u2019s taking over everything and now he wants to take over the Internet.\\u2019 But it was a reactive, visceral response without a real understanding.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The arcane fight over net neutrality is about to burst into the open. House and Senate panels will hold hearings on Wednesday pitting the heads of the cable television and wireless lobbies against Amazon and scrappy little Etsy, an online craft market.\\\",\\\"Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who now heads the commerce committee, hopes to have legislation ready the following week \\u2014 ahead of the F.C.C.\\u2019s February meeting and what Internet activists are calling \\u201cthe most important F.C.C. vote of our lifetime.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cBy turning the F.C.C. away from a heavy-handed and messy approach to regulating the Internet, this draft protects both consumers who rely on Internet services and innovators who create jobs,\\u201d Mr. Thune said about his legislation in a statement.\\\",\\\"Internet companies and online activists say Republicans have adopted the language of the net neutrality movement, even as they carry the water of the cable companies, and they are preparing for battle.\\\",\\\"Some of those same players blackened their website, appealed to their customers and ultimately torpedoed bipartisan legislation in 2012 to combat online piracy in amajor new economy-old economy fight.\\\",\\\"Once again, an Internet regulatory showdown might be guided as much by grass-roots guerrilla tactics as the lobbying of Comcast and Verizon. The F.C.C. has received four million comments on net neutrality \\u2014 overwhelmingly in favor \\u2014 ahead of its Feb. 26 decision day, second only to Janet Jackson\\u2019s \\u201cwardrobe malfunction\\u201d at the Super Bowl in 2004.\\\",\\\"After Mr. Cruz called net neutrality \\u201cthe biggest regulatory threat to the Internet\\u201d on hisFacebook page, the entry was flooded with comments like \\u201cI\\u2019m a Republican, and I support Sen. Cruz, and I\\u2019m a big admirer, but on this, he\\u2019s wrong, very wrong,\\u201d or \\u201cI\\u2019m a Ted Cruz fan, but as a small website owner, it seems to me net neutrality is a good thing,\\u201d and \\u201cSenator Cruz, you are risking alienating a huge part of your base by such a pro-monopoly stance. The battle for net neutrality is a conservative cause.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Internet activists, backed by many Internet companies, like Reddit, Vimeo, Netflix and Tumblr, staged an Internet slowdown in September to draw attention to their cause, much as online stunts by Wikipedia and Google in early 2012 stunned the powerful motion picture and music industries and helped bring down the Stop Online Piracy Act.\\\",\\\"This time, the fight might be even more palpable to consumers. Companies like Netflix say they need protection against behemoths like Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T and Time Warner Cable, which could use their power over cable and fiber-optic lines to slow consumer access to websites that offer competing content or fail to pay for fast service.\\\",\\\"Between summer 2013 and early 2014, Comcast customers found their access to Netflix getting progressively slower as Netflix\\u2019s streaming grew more popular and Comcast refused to upgrade its capacity, Netflix officials say. Then last February, Netflix did what Comcast wanted: It paid a still-undisclosed sum and the problem went away.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe reason I think Netflix has captured people\\u2019s attention is what happened to our service was real, it was bad, and it was recent,\\u201d said Corie Wright, the director of global public policy at Netflix. \\u201cThey think of that buffering signal and the video that didn\\u2019t start and the problems that net neutrality is supposed to solve were literally brought home.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Comcast officials declined to comment, citing F.C.C. deliberations, not only on net neutrality regulations but also on the company\\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal.\\\",\\\"But in afiling to the F.C.C.last month, the company said reclassifying wireless and wired broadband service as a regulated public utility would harm investment and diminish capacity. If a broadband company throttled access to popular sites like Netflix, the company contends, customers would simply go to a competitor.\\\",\\\"In that sense, broadband providers argue, net neutrality is a solution in search of a problem.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe public discourse on open Internet issues has now reached a fever pitch,\\u201d Comcast wrote. \\u201cEmotion and hyperbole are substituting for fact.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Verizon, in its public policy blog, was evenmore blunt, blaming Netflix for the slow service Verizon customers were complaining about. Despite \\u201can unprecedented amount of data\\u201d to send, the video-streaming company was using cut-rate providers \\u2014 \\u201cperhaps to cut costs and improve its profitability\\u201d \\u2014 to carry content to the big broadband companies, Verizon said. \\u201cNetflix knew better. Netflix is responsible,\\u201d Verizon said.\\\",\\\"Internet activists say the \\u201csolution in search of a problem\\u201d argument is growing thin, after the Netflix episode and other issues. And the coalition appears to be girding for a fight \\u2014 and hoping to catch politicians on the wrong side of what one cable lobbyist called \\u201creligion\\u201d more than policy discourse.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe libertarian conservative base is pretty astute at recognizing crony capitalism and understand how campaign finance and corporate influence affects policy,\\u201d said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, a net neutrality advocacy group. \\u201cAnd this is a pretty transparent moment for all that.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"title\": \"Shifting Politics of Net Neutrality Debate Ahead of F.C.C.
