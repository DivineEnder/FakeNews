In August, Mr. Obama launched air assaults, invoking his power as commander in chief.\\\",\\\"At the time, the White House said the president had no need to go to Congress for its approval \\u2014 known as an authorization for use of military force, or A.U.M.F. \\u2014 drawing criticism from members of both parties who called on Mr. Obama to be more forthcoming about his strategy. But in November, Mr. Obama said he was ready to engage Congress on the issue.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe president welcomes bipartisan interest from members on a new, ISIL-targeted A.U.M.F. from Congress that provides a clear signal of support for our ongoing military operations against the group,\\u201d a White House official said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the private meeting.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAt the request of bipartisan members,\\u201d the official added, \\u201cthe White House will continue to work with the congressional leaders on the details of that language, and we look forward to sharing a draft with Congress that reflects their bipartisan input.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The speaker of the House,John A. Boehnerof Ohio, who has repeatedly called on the president to send his proposal for the military force resolution to Capitol Hill, said he renewed the request on Tuesday, adding that historically, it is the role of the commander in chief to do so.\\\",\\\"Mr. Boehner told the president that if he drafted such a plan, sent it to Capitol Hill and worked to garner backing from both parties, \\u201cRepublicans will work with him to build bipartisan support for its enactment,\\u201d according to an account of the meeting released by his office.\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama had said the meeting was a chance to discuss areas of common ground between him and congressional leaders, including cybersecurity legislation, trade and a tax overhaul.\\\",\\\"\\u201cObviously there are disagreements around the table on a whole range of issues, but there are also areas where we can agree, and that\\u2019s where we\\u2019re going to be focused,\\u201d Mr. Obama said before the gathering in the Cabinet Room. He said he looked forward to some \\u201creal collaboration\\u201d in the coming months.\\\",\\\"Still, Republicans challenged him during the session about the rash of veto threats he has issued \\u2014 five since Congress has been in session in 2015 \\u2014 saying it made the collaboration Mr. Obama was calling for more difficult.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe told him it was not helpful, because what it does is it makes getting started harder,\\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. \\u201cBut we\\u2019re determined not to be deterred by his premature veto threats.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Republicans said they would not shrink from a clash with the White House on one item the president has threatened to veto \\u2014 a homeland security funding bill that Republicans plan to use to roll back Mr. Obama\\u2019s executive action on immigration.\\\",\\\"Mr. Boehner told Mr. Obama the House would \\u201cpush forward\\u201d with the legislation and, his office\\u2019s account said, \\u201creminded the president that he himself had stated publicly many times in the past that he did not have the power to rewrite immigration law through executive action.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 337092}"
