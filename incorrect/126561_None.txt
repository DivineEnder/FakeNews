"{\"title\": \"Trailer Talk: 'Man of Steel' Villains Will Make Superman Break a Sweat\", \"content\": \"The past few trailers were all familiar territory: the Kansas cornfield kid years,\\u00a0Supes flying faster than a speeding bullet, feeling like an outcast, magisterial score, etc. The only real changes from Bryan Singer\\u2019s (in my opinion, underrated) Superman Returns were shaky-cam, a strawberry blonde Lois Lane (Amy Adams), and\\u00a0Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) working blue-collar jobs instead of The Daily Planet. That last one was a nice touch; finally we\\u2019re getting hip to the fact that everyone hates journalists.The final trailer gives a fuller picture of the film\\u2019s villain, General Zod (Michael Shannon), and it actually gives us a reason to care.I groaned when I first heard Snyder & co. were recycling the villain from Superman II. Superhero films\\u2013and adventure films in general\\u2013are only as good as their antagonists. If the viewer can\\u2019t sense any danger, he or she has no reason for emotional investment. And what would new dimension would it bring to the Superman universe to see our hero just slug it out with another Kryptonian with a Millennial-friendly, \\u201cdark/edgy\\u201d makeover?Thankfully, the film\\u2019s writers took a wholly different approach to Zod. Here we see not just three evil Supermen taking turns against Kal-El but an entire army, dressed as interstellar conquistadors but acting more like marshalls hunting down a fugitive. They seem like\\u2013after all these years\\u2013an actual threat to Superman.Further, the threat is twofold: if he doesn\\u2019t turn himself in, they\\u2019ll throw down some War of the Worlds mayhem all around the globe. And, being such bad dudes, we know they\\u2019ll do that just to spite Superman anyway. We know that once he goes head to head with Zod, he\\u2019ll pound him into jelly. But what about the rest of the army? What about those giant warships? What about that Incredibles/Doc Ock-looking robot?How is he going to get out of this one?And that is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves after a Superman trailer. Warner Brothers\\u2019 marketing team just made this summer blockbuster a \\u201cDay 1\\u201d rather than a \\u201cmaybe.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 126561}"
