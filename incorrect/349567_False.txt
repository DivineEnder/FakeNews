"{\"article_id\": 349567, \"title\": \"Why David Einhorn Wants Two Flavors of GM Shares\", \"content\": \"Billionaire investor David Einhorn\\u2019s is pushing General Motors Co. for changes to its share structure that the hedge fund hopes will kickstart returns.The Wall Street Journal was\\u00a0first to report\\u00a0that hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc. wants GM to split its common stock into two separate classes: One class would pay dividends, and another would entitle its holders to all earnings after the dividend is paid.GM\\u2019s stock currently sports an unusually cheap valuation even as it pays\\u00a0an above-market dividend. Mr. Einhorn says the split will make one type of shares attractive to yield-hungry investors while the other type would be coveted by value-focused ones. He used the following analogy on CNBC: Greenlight\\u2019s proposal would turn an ice cream stand that only serves vanilla-chocolate swirl into one that separately serves chocolate and vanilla.GM disagrees.\\u00a0A spokeswoman called the proposed share structure \\u201cunprecedented and untested\\u201d and said it creates risks that are \\u201cunacceptable\\u201d and \\u201caren\\u2019t in the best interest of our shareholders.\\u201dThe following charts help explain what Mr. Einhorn is driving at. GM\\u2019s shares rose 2.7% in recent trading.First and foremost, Mr. Einhorn says that GM is too cheap and that the auto maker\\u2019s stock price doesn\\u2019t reflect the intrinsic value of its operations. GM\\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio, based on analyst forecasts for the next year, ended Monday at 5.6, the cheapest among all stocks in the S&P 500, according to Greenlight\\u2019s slide deck.Compare that with a P/E ratio for rival Ford Motor near 7.1 and the S&P 500 at 17.5.Next, Mr. Einhorn points out that GM\\u2019s stock price has gone virtually nowhere since returning to the public markets in November 2010 at $33 a share. The stock ended Monday at $34.71; the S&P 500 has more than doubled over the same time period. Still, GM argues that it has outperformed Ford over the past several years.This, as GM has increased earnings per share over the past few years.Next, Greenlight makes the case that the company\\u2019s dividend yield of 4.4% is sky high considering that the company uses a smaller-than-average slice of profits to reward shareholders. GM\\u2019s payout ratio, the percentage of profits it uses to fund dividend payouts, is just 24%. By contrast, the average for S&P 500 companies heading into 2017 was 40%, according to FactSet.Even though GM\\u2019s dividend yield is more than double the 2% of the S&P 500, Greenlight says that this dividend is \\u201cnot respected by the market\\u201d in part because a lower proportion of profits gets returned to shareholders.Finally, Mr. Einhorn contends that owning auto markers is a savvy play given that the U.S. economy is perking up and stands to benefit further should pro-growth policies under the Trump administration come to fruition.\\u201cWhen you think about the Trump economy, the goal focuses on jobs\\u2026. higher wages and higher interest income because the Fed is raising rates,\\u201d Mr. Einhorn said on CNBC. Higher levels of income will boost demand for vehicles, he said: \\u201cIf you believe in the Trump story, you should be investing in durables, like autos.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 22245}"
