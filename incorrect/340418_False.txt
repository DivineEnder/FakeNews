Mills) and kept her up-to-date on her image in the media. Other emails she received sought privileged access and favors, and in one, the wife of the former prime minister of Britain, Tony Blair, passed on a r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 for a young man applying for a job.\\\",\\\"In all, this second cache of emails that Mrs. Clinton sent and received during 2009 and parts of 2010, released by the State Department by court order, added 1,356 new tiles to the mosaic of her tenure in President Obama\\u2019s cabinet. And the monthly release of the emails prescribed by the court ensures that her handling of her electronic correspondence will be updated throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.\\\",\\\"Last week the inspectors general of the State Department and the nation\\u2019s intelligence agencies disclosed that they had discovered classified information on the private email account that Mrs. Clinton used, stating that such material should not have been stored outside secure government computer systems \\u2014 in this case, on a server she kept at her house.\\\",\\\"Mrs. Clinton has maintained that none of the information on her server had been classified, though the State Department classified dozens of documents after the emails were released, first on June 30 and again on Friday. In one email released on Friday, Huma Abedin, a close adviser, forwarded a note written by an aide to the former British foreign minister, David Miliband, that \\u201che doesn\\u2019t want to send through the system.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Five pages that follow have been redacted entirely, and marked classified until 20 years after Nov. 21, 2009, when the note was forwarded to Mrs. Clinton. The aide, Matthew Gould, said that Mr. Miliband had just returned from Afghanistan\\u2019s capital, Kabul, and \\u201cvery much wants the secretary (only) to see this note\\u201d and to \\u201ctalk it over with her\\u201d as soon as possible.\\\",\\\"It was not clear that it was among the emails cited by the inspectors general.\\\",\\\"A note on the email said it had been classified only on Thursday. It and other emails that were released show that Mrs. Clinton and her aides exchanged notes and memos on all sorts of diplomatic matters, from negotiations with the Russians at a time the Obama administration was seeking to improve relations with the Kremlin to the discussions over the Israeli settlement freeze in 2009.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAbu Mazen wants to see it,\\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, referring to the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, in response to an email from another close aide, Jacob J. Sullivan.\\\",\\\"Like the disclosure of tens of thousands of emails by WikiLeaks in 2010, the release of these emails has provided granular details of diplomacy that would normally would not become public for years, if ever.\\\",\\\"\\u201cMany thx for your kind note,\\u201d the former American ambassador to Baghdad, Christopher R. Hill, responded when Mrs. Clinton praised the work he was doing. \\u201cI wish I felt better about iraqis as a result, but I truly remain worried about these people. They are truly a collective pain in the neck.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Many of the notes involved mundane logistical matters, such as ensuring that her office had the New York State apples Mrs. Clinton liked.\\\",\\\"Others offered telling insights into the issues and personalities she encountered on the job.\\\",\\\"Dozens of the emails involved appointments to various positions in the State Department, with people lobbying for themselves and others \\u2014 or sometimes against them. Ivo Daalder, a former ambassador to NATO, sent one email detailing \\u201cthree major reasons\\u201d why one candidate was \\u201cnot the right person for the job.\\u201d The name, like all of the potential appointees, is redacted, as was the position in question.\\\",\\\"The emails underscored the privileged status of having Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s direct address. Strobe Talbott, the former deputy secretary of state who now heads the Brookings Institution, wrote to her directly, expressing concerns that \\u201ctime-sensitive messages\\u201d were not getting through Ms. Mills\\u2019s State Department email.\\\",\\\"Mr. Blair\\u2019s wife, Cherie, used the personal address at least a dozen times in 2009, pressing Mrs. Clinton to meet with \\u201cmy friend,\\u201d Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Missned, a Qatari royal, and praising Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s work.\\\",\\\"With the subject line \\u201cNo longer homicidal,\\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote to Ms. Mills about Mark Penn, who was her pollster and chief strategist when she was a presidential candidate in 2008, who had earlier conducted polling for a former prime minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra.\\\",\\\"\\u201cCould you try to contact Mark Penn to confirm he no longer represents Thaksin before I call Thai PM at 9:30?\\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
