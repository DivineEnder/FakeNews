"{\"article_id\": 271604, \"title\": \"BH Interview: Comedy Duo Hone the Fine Art of Making Viral Videos\", \"content\": \"The clip caught fire on YouTube late last month, and the folks over at NBC\\u2019s \\u201cToday\\u201d featured it on Monday.Yet the Mass.-based duo isn\\u2019t on a TV set near you. Not yet, at least.Fatawesome\\u2019s latest video debuted on YouTube the day before Thanksgiving and quickly ran up more than a million hits. The clip\\u2019s tally to date? North of 4.5 million views.The joke is blissfully simple, comparing how cats and dogs behave in a silly yet inspired fashion. It\\u2019s what\\u00a0Jimmy Craig and Justin Parker of\\u00a0Billerica, Mass.\\u00a0have been doing ever since comparing comedy notes in high school \\u2013 creating absurd humor videos with an edge.\\u201cWe made this intentionally to go viral. Our goal is to work in television, and every project we release we try to take a step toward that goal,\\u201d\\u00a0Craig tells Big Hollywood.Craig says the duo\\u2019s other videos tend to be less mainstream friendly, like \\u201cHow to Hang Out with Black People.\\u201d\\u00a0Fatawesome\\u2019s videos have gone viral before, but their current success is unprecedented for them. Their work appears on Cracked.com as well as Funnyordie.com, and they also do stand-up comedy and online comics.The pair have a basic humor pact that has served them well so far.\\u201cIf Justin and I agree on something \\u2026 we drop what we\\u2019re doing and we film it,\\u201d Craig says.The duo\\u2019s web site sets out their agenda:\\u00a0We make videos, comics, do standup, music, events, and anything else for attention.\\u00a0Please give us money to make a TV show or a movie. This is our job and there\\u2019s no backup plan.They understand they\\u2019ve entered relatively uncharted territory. They wouldn\\u2019t be the first performers to parlay Internet infamy into the real deal. Just ask Justin Bieber how that can work out. Then again, anyone with a laptop and a cute cat can, in theory, create the next viral video without a scrap of talent.\\u201cYou can\\u2019t solicit to an agent. You have to hope that you make something that someone sees and passes it along to an agent,\\u201d Parker says. \\u201cThe goal is to keep trying to make things as big as possible.\\u201dThe feedback from their latest video does offer some comfort.\\u201cWe had a lot of interesting responses from people,\\u201d Craig says. \\u201cSomeone from Italy sent a transcript of the video in Italian for us to upload \\u2026 the deaf community asked for closed captions.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2}"
