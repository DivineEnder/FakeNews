He also said there\\u2019s international support, citing sanctions designations on Hezbollah by Gulf countries. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a good head of steam here,\\u201d he said, noting that the investigation into the businessman predates the current administration.

Terror networks frequently disperse and reconstitute under the radar after receiving the unwanted attention, but here, he said, \\u201cthe Justice Department pursued it doggedly. That\\u2019s a positive thing to observe.\\u201dReaders can subscribe to The Morning Risk Report here:\\u00a0http://on.wsj.com/MorningRiskReportSignup.\\u00a0Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.COMPLIANCEJohnson Controls exploits pay-disclosure loophole.
