"{\"title\": \"'Law and Order' Trashes ACORN Videos\", \"content\": \"Dick Wolf has fallen from the heights as a writer on \\u201cHill Street Blues,\\u201d a supervising producer of \\u201cMiami Vice\\u201d and the creator/producer of the once-excellent \\u201cLaw and Order\\u201d trilogy.   The flagship of the \\u201cLaw and Order\\u201d series is \\u201cLaw and Order,\\u201d the two other shows being \\u201cSVU\\u201d (Special Victims Unit) and \\u201cCI\\u201d(Criminal Intent). Perhaps 20 years is too long for any series, but \\u201cLaw and Order\\u201d has devolved into the cheapest form of left-wing paranoid delusion. It is so obvious, it gives left-wing propaganda a bad name. Maybe Karl Rove planted a mole.   I now watch it for its comedic satirical value, as one would watch \\u201cSaturday Night Live.\\u201d\\n\\nDick WolfThe last episode was \\u201cFed.\\u201d It\\u2019s a story about an ACORN-like community organizing group called \\u201cRights Alliance.\\u201d  The founder of the Rights Alliance has a conservative infiltrator murdered to \\u201ccover up a cover-up.\\u201d The cover up is an affair the founder was having with one of its members. The \\u201ccover up of the cover-up\\u201d was the money being paid by the founder to his mistress\\u2019s husband to keep the affair quiet. The right-wing infiltrator was murdered because he had been secretly video taping a sting he was arranging unrelated to the affair\\u2013clearly meant to be reminiscent of the O\\u2019Keefe/Giles real life ACORN investigation.  The founder feared this tape would open the organization up to scrutiny, thus exposing his affair and the subsequent monetary extortion to his girlfriend\\u2019s husband. We are not supposed to be shedding too many tears for our murder victim, given he was \\u201ctricking a few dumb kids in an ambush video.\\u201dThe victim was found with the words \\u201cFed\\u201d printed on his chest, apparently to throw our eagle-eyed detective team of Bernard and Lupo off the scent. You see, \\u201cright wingers\\u201d hate government so much we murder government employees all the time. Of course, Rights Alliance is a non-profit group, not a Government agency, but the writers assume dopey murdering \\u201cright wingers\\u201d might think Rights Alliance are government agents. This makes scrawling the word \\u201cFed\\u201d on the victim\\u2019s chest a great ruse. Get it?But the real action is how \\u201cconservatives\\u201d are portrayed and characterized. As implied above, the show makes more sense as a parody of the left-wing view of the right than it is effective propaganda for the left. This is now its entertainment value. The first suspect for the infiltrator\\u2019s murder is a \\u201cPatriot Ranger,\\u201d a crazed group that is stated to be linked with \\u201clast summer\\u2019s Tea Party Movement.\\u201d The Patriot Rangers look like casting rejects from the movie \\u201cDeliverance.\\u201d They carry rifles in Manhattan, are unshaven, uncouth, and it looks like you could smell them from 50 feet. The suspect, who is innocent, is still made to appear repulsive. He calls the detectives \\u201cObamabots,\\u201d which they reacted to with shock and anger.Our erstwhile \\u201cO\\u2019Keefe\\u201d style infiltrator is said to be a \\u201cmilitant conservative.\\u201d What makes one a militant conservative? Our murder victim is \\u201cmilitant\\u201d because in college he ran a student group supporting George W. Bush\\u2019s reelection. His roommate from college tells the detective Lupo the O\\u2019Keefe character \\u201chated liberals.\\u201dOf course, Jack McCoy has to get in his two cents. He states how he has always been a supporter of Rights Alliance, which \\u201chas worked across party lines.\\u201d He proceeds to tell his DAs to \\u201cgo the extra mile\\u201d before \\u201cblowing up\\u201d up the Rights Alliance group because of its historical good works like \\u201cpredatory lending reform,\\u201d \\u201chousing reform,\\u201d and \\u201cminimum wage reform\\u201d\\u2013the heart of the left\\u2019s financial reform agenda. (The first two were instrumental in helping take down our financial system in 2008.)In a \\u201ctown hall\\u201d meeting held by McCoy for Patriot Rangers (read: Teabaggers) and Rights Alliance, both groups get unruly, but the worst epithets naturally emanate from the Rangers. One exclaims: \\u201cSocialist Scum!\\u201d McCoy is genuinely pained when the Rights Alliance group does not believe his plea for patience because he supported their work for years. He made no such assertion to the \\u201cDeliverance\\u201d styled Patriot Ranger/Tea Party crowd.This episode also comes on the heels of an \\u201cSVU\\u201d show earlier in the week where some character refers to various Fox opinion show hosts and Rush Limbaugh as \\u201ccancers\\u201d in society.There is a \\u201cLast Days of Pompeii\\u201d feel to Wolf\\u2019s \\u201cLaw and Order\\u201d empire. He has become very wealthy delivering prime time crime drama to television, and the truth is his shows have been high quality. But it\\u2019s time to hang it up. These shows have become message delivery machines. When drama is subordinated to politics, it\\u2019s no longer popular art, but cheap propaganda.Dick should get out while it\\u2019s only a little too late.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 277743}"
