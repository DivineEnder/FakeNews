"{\"title\": \"Why the Eleanor Holmes Norton Phone Call Matters\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Those of you who wish to understand the criminal organization masquerading as a political party \\u2014 that would be the Democrats \\u2014 need only to remember one thing: the very first Democrat vice-president, Aaron Burr, shot and killed one of the Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton. Although charged with murder in both New York and New Jersey Burr, of course, skated. The tone was set right from the start.\\n\\n\\nOf even greater lasting impact, however, was Burr\\u2019s transformation of the Society of St. Tammany into Tammany Hall, from a social club into the most rapacious big-city political machine in the country, one whose power lasted well into the 20th century and formed the model for similar machines \\u2014 in Chicago, Kansas City and elsewhere \\u2014 across the country.\\nIf and when Tammany is thought of today, it conjures up images of Irishmen in bowler hats and three-piece suits, mustaches bristling.  But Tammany\\u2019s position at the nexus of the Democrat Party and New York City\\u2019s burgeoning gangland, especially at the turn of the century, is where it really made its mark. Tammany employed fleets of shtarkers \\u2014 \\u201cstrongmen\\u201d like the great Monk Eastman, leader of the ultra-violent Lower East Side street gang, the Eastmans \\u2014 to beat up Republican voters and otherwise intimidate the electorate.   It doled out patronage (Tammany was unalterably opposed to the civil-service system, although it later co-opted it). And it never missed an opportunity to take an opportunity: \\u201cI seen my opportunities, and I took \\u2019em\\u201d may as well have been the official motto of the Wigwam on 14th Street.\\nThose, however, were the words of the man who best exemplified the Tammany ethos, sachem George Washington Plunkitt, who popularized the term, \\u201chonest graft.\\u201d His immortal words on how to run a big-city machine were written down and published in book form by a journalist of the day, William Riordan, under the title, Plunkitt of Tammany Hall.\\nWhat has all this got to do with Norton and her now-infamous phone call? This: the real Culture of Corruption is systemic within the Democrat Party, and always has been. It is baked into the cake, as it were, so much a part of it that Democrats literally cannot see it for the corruption that it so obviously is. And since, as far as the party of the Little Guy is concerned, taxes and ethics are for the Little Guy, they continue on in the belief that because they only have the best interests of the country in mind, whatever they do must therefore be right. Forget ethics, morality and all them highfalutin\\u2019 words: if it\\u2019s not actually illegal, it\\u2019s OK. And even if it actually is illegal\\u2026 well, that\\u2019s what lawyers are for.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s Plunkitt on how to succeed in politics:Now, I\\u2019ve told you what not to do; I guess I can explain best what to do to succeed in politics by tellin\\u2019 you what I did. After goin\\u2019 through the apprenticeship of the business while I was a boy by workin\\u2019 around the district headquarters and hustlin\\u2019 about the polls on election day, I set out when I cast my first vote to win fame and money in New York City politics. Did I offer my services to the district leader as a stump-speaker? Not much. The woods are always full of speakers. Did I get up a hook on municipal government and show it to the leader? I wasn\\u2019t such a fool. What I did was to get some marketable goods before goin\\u2019 to the leaders. What do I mean by marketable goods? Let me tell you: I had a cousin, a young man who didn\\u2019t take any particular interest in politics. I went to him and said: \\u201cTommy, I\\u2019m goin\\u2019 to be a politician, and I want to get a followin\\u2019; can I count on you?\\u201d He said: \\u201cSure, George.\\u2019, That\\u2019s how I started in business. I got a marketable commodity \\u2013 one vote. Then I went to the district leader and told him I could command two votes on election day, Tommy\\u2019s and my own. He smiled on me and told me to go ahead. If I had offered him a speech or a bookful of learnin\\u2019, he would have said, \\u201cOh, forget it!\\u201dThat was beginnin\\u2019 business in a small way, wasn\\u2019t it? But that is the only way to become a real lastin\\u2019 statesman. I soon branched out. Two young men in the flat next to mine were school friends \\u2013 I went to them, just as I went to Tommy, and they agreed to stand by me. Then I had a followin\\u2019 of three voters and I began to get a bit chesty. Whenever I dropped into district headquarters, everybody shook hands with me, and the leader one day honored me by lightin\\u2019 a match for my cigar. And so it went on like a snowball rollin\\u2019 down a hill I worked the flat-house that I lived in from the basement to the top floor, and I got about a dozen young men to follow me. Then I tackled the next house and so on down the block and around the corner. Before long I had sixty men back of me, and formed the George Washington Plunkitt Association.That is the way and the only way to\\u2019 make a lastin\\u2019 success in politics. If you are goin\\u2019 to cast your first vote next November and want to go into politics, do as I did. Get a followin\\u2019, if it\\u2019s only one man, and then go to the district leader and say: \\u201cI want to join the organization. I\\u2019ve got one man who\\u2019ll follow me through thick and thin.\\u201d The leader won\\u2019t laugh at your one-man followin\\u2019. He\\u2019ll shake your hand warmly, offer to propose you for membership in his club, take you down to the corner for a drink and ask you to call again. But go to him and say: \\u201cI took first prize at college in Aristotle; I can recite all Shakespeare forwards and backwards; there ain\\u2019t nothin\\u2019 in science that ain\\u2019t as familiar to me as blockades on the elevated roads and I\\u2019m the real thing in the way of silver-tongued orators.\\u201d What will he answer? He\\u2019ll probably say: \\u201cI guess you are not to blame for your misfortunes, but we have no use for you here.\\u201dWhat has this got to do with the Norton phone call?   Simply this: to the Dems and their sympathizers in the still-silent MSM, Norton\\u2019s dialing for dollars is a dog-bites-man story, an \\u201ceverybody does it\\u201d story (\\u201ceverybody\\u201d in this case meaning \\u201cthem\\u201d).
