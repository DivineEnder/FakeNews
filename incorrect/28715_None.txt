"{\"article_id\": 28715, \"title\": \"Conservative groups eye ultimate triumph: Cruz in 2016\", \"content\": \"Washington\\u2019s cabal of influential conservative groups has had its share of setbacks in recent years. The 2013 government shutdown, disastrous challenges to establishment lawmakers, the recent spate of bipartisan dealmaking in Congress last year \\u2014 those were just a few of the lowlights.But now the likes of Heritage Action for America and the Club for Growth are smelling victory in the Republican presidential primary \\u2014 possibly the ultimate victory. Ted Cruz as the GOP nominee would be the literal embodiment of their uncompromising legislative vision and divisive tactics. But short of Cruz, several of the other contenders \\u2014 including establishment favorite Marco Rubio \\u2014 are generally in good standing with the groups.Indeed, unless the nominee is Donald Trump, who divides the party\\u2019s right flank, the conservative groups are poised to have a Republican nominee whose policies and voting record are a repudiation of Washington leaders that the groups have battled with for years. Despite his reputation for being more accommodating, Rubio rates favorably on conservative scorecards. The Club even has nice things to say about Jeb Bush\\u2019s record as Florida governor.\\u201cThis entire cycle has been about taking on Washington, D.C., and outsiders thriving,\\u201d said Heritage Action CEO Mike Needham. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a great opportunity for us to keep pushing the message that Washington, D.C., does need to be punched in the face.\\u201dA Cruz nomination could help recruit more anti-establishment candidates for open seats in the House and Senate, pushing the center of gravity in the GOP ever more rightward.\\u201cI predict you\\u2019re going to get more conservative Cruz/Rubio type senators elected. Over time, that will push the leadership in the Senate,\\u201d said former Rep. David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth.McIntosh and Needham speak regularly and occasionally disagree on voting positions, most notably on trade. And though Cruz, Rubio and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul are likely to all do well on the Club\\u2019s forthcoming 2015 scorecard, it is Heritage Action that has played the most central role in embracing Cruz\\u2019s conservatism, including on social issues that the Club avoids.Cruz and Heritage often go to battle with GOP leaders in tandem, with Cruz able to brag of a pristine 100 percent rating on the group\\u2019s current scorecard.Cruz\\u2019s team believes \\u201cthere\\u2019s some advantage to having that distinction going through the nominating process. He\\u2019s running as the candidate to get the right,\\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). \\u201cRight now, anybody who\\u2019s trying to define Rubio as the establishment, Trump as the establishment \\u2026 those types of ratings are helpful [in] establishing those credentials.\\u201dBut senior Republican aides charge that Heritage Action is tantamount to Cruz\\u2019s \\u201csuper PAC,\\u201d suggesting the group scores different votes in Congress to hurt anyone but \\u201ctheir golden boy.\\u201dAides and senators said in interviews that Cruz\\u2019s 100 percent score with Heritage Action is no coincidence (Rubio has been dinged for his trade vote, Paul for supporting a Medicare reform bill). They say that Cruz\\u2019s switch on a big trade measure last year coincided with Heritage Action\\u2019s opposition and that the conservative lobbying outfit warned about protecting cuts to a crop insurance program but didn\\u2019t score the vote after Cruz broke with them.\\u201cTheir rating system is a joke,\\u201d said Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), a retiring lawmaker who has opened up similarly on Cruz. \\u201cThey are individually selecting ways to make the people they support look good and to make the rest of us look bad.\\u201dIn an interview last week, Needham made clear that Cruz is his favorite of the presidential contenders, though he said Heritage Action will not endorse in the presidential election. Heritage is more favorable toward Trump than Club for Growth.\\u201cEach of the front-runners is making a different case against the Washington establishment. Trump is saying they\\u2019re stupid and cowardly \\u2026 Rubio is saying these guys are stuck in the past,\\u201d Needham said. \\u201cThe structural argument that Ted is making is by far the most threatening to Washington, D.C.\\u201dBut Heritage Action officials say Cruz arrived at his position on trade on the merits, not because of coordination. And they say Cruz changed his vote on crop insurance during an active roll call, making it impossible for Heritage Action to have influenced him.Still, the group allows itself to score votes retroactively, something it has not done on anything that would dent Cruz\\u2019s conservative armor. Needham denied any coordination with Cruz and said his 100 percent score was \\u201cbad for my brand\\u201d \\u2014 he doesn\\u2019t want anyone to be perfect and imagines breaking with Cruz in the future.The Club for Growth has yet to release its 2015 scorecard and is less tactically antagonistic toward Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) than other groups like Heritage Action and Senate Conservatives Fund. McIntosh said he acknowledges that keeping that keeping the Senate in Republican hands in 2016 will be a tough task \\u2014 hence less focus on knocking off sitting GOP senators and a concentration on protecting conservative incumbents like Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.Though Heritage has indicated Trump could be friendly to the conservative movement, the Club is warning the GOP could get stuck with a closet liberal if it nominates him.\\u201cFor us, the lineup\\u2019s great behind Trump. But the key problem remains that Trump is in the lead \\u2026 and we need to point out he\\u2019s not a true conservative,\\u201d McIntosh said in an interview. \\u201cIf we get a Cruz-Rubio race out of it, that\\u2019s an all-Club for Growth primary.\\u201dThe groups see the Republican presidential race as a repudiation of the way GOP leaders have been running Washington \\u2014 the very critique they\\u2019ve been making for years.\\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete validation of what these conservative groups have been working for for so many years. A lot of these groups work to elect people, and the Republican leadership act like they don\\u2019t exist,\\u201d said Amanda Carpenter, a former top aide to both Cruz and former Sen. Jim DeMint, who now heads The Heritage Foundation, the think tank behind Heritage Action. \\u201cThe national progression is to take the White House with a solid conservative candidate, and Cruz is perfectly positioned to do that in a way that no one else is.\\u201dAllies of GOP leaders joke darkly that if McConnell embraced the scorched-earth tactics of Cruz and Heritage, there would be little left of the Capitol other than ashes. Even Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), another darling of the right, acknowledged that outside groups like the Club and Heritage Action can be \\u201chard to deal with\\u201d and push unrealistic strategies.But the real possibility of a conservative GOP nominee who is beloved by those groups brought a smile to Sessions\\u2019 face.\\u201cWell, my mama always told me not to say, \\u2018I told you so,\\u2019\\u201d Sessions said.Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
