"{\"title\": \"Foul-Mouthed and Proud of It on the \\u201916 Campaign Trail\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Donald J. Trumppledged to bomb the, uh, stuffing out of the Islamic State.\\\",\\\"SenatorRand Paulcalled any proposed trade-off between safety and liberty nothing but \\u201cbull,\\u201d before adding a syllable.\\\",\\\"EvenJeb Bush, the stern patrician of the Republican race, has shown a growing fondness for some gentler four-letter words, at times adding them to prepared remarks that had called for something meeker.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe\\u2019re Americans, damn it!\\u201d he shouted recently at a New Hampshire barbecue, though no one had suggested otherwise.\\\",\\\"A little more than two months before the voting begins, the candidates have charged into what appears to be the inaugural profanity primary, wrought by an overstuffed field of competitors vying for attention and the specter of a foul-mouthed Manhattanite perched atop the polls.\\\",\\\"The reasons for saltiness seem varied \\u2014 a play for machismo, perhaps, particularly as national security becomes a chief focus, or a signal of vitality, rawness, a willingness to break through the din. Across both parties, female candidates in the race \\u2014 Carly Fiorina and Hillary Rodham Clinton \\u2014 have little reputation for using such language.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAre you allowed to use profanity?\\u201d Mr. Paul asked, after doing so on Nov. 19, to raucous cheers during remarks at George Washington University.\\\",\\\"It would appear so.\\\",\\\"Yet the outbursts make clear the extent to which Mr. Trump, the election\\u2019s clear pacesetter in vulgarity, continues to dictate the tenor of the race. (Though in recent days, his most provocative remarks, by most accounts, have been perfectly printable \\u2014 like claiming, against all evidence, that he saw thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York.)\\\",\\\"Candidates hoping to outswear Mr. Trump are almost certainly overmatched. He has appraised the friendship between Mr. Bush and Senator Marco Rubio as \\u201cpolitical BS,\\u201d without abbreviating, and twice told an Ohio crowd \\u201cyou bet your ass\\u201d he would revive the interrogation technique known as waterboarding.\\\",\\\"A recent interview about Mr. Trump\\u2019s Twitter habits ended with this warning: \\u201cTreat us fairly,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOtherwise I\\u2019ll tweet the\\u201d \\u2014 er, daylights \\u2014 \\u201coutta you.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump\\u2019s advisers see his influence in his rivals\\u2019 choice of words, noting Mr. Paul\\u2019s expletive this month and an email to supporters using that word.\\\",\\\"\\u201cRand totally admires and worships Mr. Trump and copies anything he says,\\u201d said Corey Lewandowski, the Trump campaign manager, in an email. (\\u201cClaiming Rand is imitating Trump? Now that\\u2019s really\\u201d \\u2014 ahem, a farce \\u2014 retorted Doug Stafford, Mr. Paul\\u2019s main adviser, who in fact repeated the out-of-bounds noun his boss had used at G.W.U.)\\\",\\\"There have, of course, been indecorous moments in presidential politics before. George W. Bush, on the trail in 2000, was caughtswearing into a live microphonewhile assessing a reporter from The New York Times. Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and a Navy veteran, could be quite coarse.\\\",\\\"And this election season was robbed of perhaps its most colorful imprecatory prospect when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. decided against a run. (His masterpiece: calling the president\\u2019shealth care lawa \\u201cbig deal,\\u201d with a two-syllable modifier in between, duringwhat he thought was a private aside.)\\\",\\\"But those moments became public by accident. Such frequent, deliberate cursing by presidential candidates addressing campaign audiences in this election cycle seems to be without modern precedent. It is a striking departure for a party whose 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, let fly expressions like \\u201cH-E-double-hockey-sticks\\u201d when he wanted to be puckish.\\\",\\\"Republican officials have strained to adjust, questioning whether the moment will last.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe does it because he needs attention and can\\u2019t control himself,\\u201d Stuart Stevens, who was Mr. Romney\\u2019s chief strategist, said of Mr. Trump. \\u201cBoth are not qualities in demand in a president.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member, said it was all \\u201cjust part of this strange reality-TV era we are suffering through.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Some milder adjectives appear to be bipartisan. In the first Democratic debate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermontmemorably declaredthat America was tired of hearing about Hillary Rodham Clinton\\u2019s \\u201cdamn emails.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Lower-polling candidates in the Republican field have gravitated instead toward a Trump-like tactic: Insult rivals, add a dash of profanity, end with a rhetorical question.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou\\u2019ve got the No. 2 guy tried to kill somebody at 14, and the No. 1 guy is high-energy and crazy as hell,\\u201dSenator Lindsey Graham said on MSNBC last month, referring to Ben Carson, who has said he tried to stab a friend as a teenager, and Mr. Trump. \\u201cHow am I losing to these people?\\u201d\\\",\\\"Even the mellow Mr. Carson has participated, gingerly.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis is a bunch of crap,\\u201d he said at the debate in Boulder, Colo., last month, discussing government regulations.\\\",\\\"Some candidates seem to relish the shift in decorum. When Mr. Trump offered his colorful assessment of the Bush-Rubio relationship in September, Mr. Bush was asked to respond generally to the slight. \\u201cI will not answer that question until I hear exactly what he said and the terminology he used,\\u201d he said, feigning a dodge until the reporter, Dana Bash of CNN, obliged.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI just wanted to hear it,\\u201d he said with a smirk.\\\",\\\"For news organizations, style guidelines generally dictate that obscenities should not be printed unless they are newsworthy.\\\",\\\"A bleepworthy Mr. Bush, for instance, would not be afforded a literal rendering. But a President Bush? Hot damn.\\\"}\"}"
