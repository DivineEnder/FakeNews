Four years ago, he appeared in a video about young kids in the Cardiff area and the filmmaker was impressed by Khan\\u2019s knowledge of politics. Khan said he wants to rid the world of evil and hoped to become the UK\\u2019s first Asian prime minister.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 203851}"
