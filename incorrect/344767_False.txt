"{\"title\": \"How Delegate Rules Explain Your Political Party\", \"content\": \"{\\\"The remaining Republican presidential candidates are entering the Darwinian phase of the campaign \\u2014 if they lose in certain states, they get nothing. Democrats are continuing with their proportional allocation of delegates \\u2014 if they lose, theyprobably still get a trophy.\\\",\\\"Democrats also have more unbound delegates, the so-called superdelegates, than Republicans. Think of the superdelegates as a regulatory body. On the Republican side, voting is more of a laissez-faire market.\\\",\\\"Starting to sense a pattern?\\\",\\\"The parties\\u2019 delegate systems uncannily reflect some of their core values, and those values are having a big effect on this year\\u2019s races.\\\",\\\"DemocratsThe setup is nearly the same in every state: The delegates are awarded proportionally; the candidate just has to get to 15 percent to qualify. That means the loser is typically rewarded for his or her fair share of the vote.\\\",\\\"RepublicansThere\\u2019s a lot more variation by state, almost as if federalism were the guiding principle, with states aslaboratories for democracy. Starting Tuesday, states are allowed to make it more likely that a winner can monopolize the delegates. In another context, Republicans generally approve of the idea that markets create winners and losers.A Pew studysaid \\u201c55 percent of conservative Republicans don\\u2019t want the government to do much or anything at all about inequality,\\u201d versus about 10 percent of Democrats who feel that way.\\\",\\\"How we got hereRepublican officials hoped to avoid a repeat of the 2012 race, when Rick Santorum helped keep the party\\u2019s favorite, Mitt Romney, from a quick and clean victory. So theychanged the rulesto make it easier for a front-running candidate to deliver knockout blows in winner-take-all or winner-take-most states \\u2014 never imagining that an insurgent like Donald Trump could be the beneficiary.\\\",\\\"The practical effectMr. Trump could take a major step toward the nomination by winning states like Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Missouri on Tuesday. Bernie Sanders can\\u2019t count on making such big leaps to catch up to Hillary Clinton because none of the Democratic races are winner-take-all or winner-take-most.\\\",\\\"DemocratsAbout 15 percent of Democratic delegates aresuperdelegates:party regulars, donors, activists, officials and union leaders. They can oversee the electoral market and potentially overrule the will of the voters. In another context, Democrats tend to be more supportive of regulation. Ina Pew survey, about 76 percent of Republicans said government regulation of business did more harm than good, but only 38 percent of Democrats felt the same way.\\\",\\\"But is the system too paternalistic? You could make the case that theDemocratic Partyis being downright undemocratic. An Upshot reader, MyThreeCents, said recently: \\u201cHillary\\u2019s superdelegates are just the modern version of the \\u2018smoke-filled room\\u2019 in which presidential candidates were picked decades ago.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist, an analyst for CNN and ABC News and a superdelegate herself, said in an email that \\u201csuperdelegates are like any other ingredient in the big bowl of democracy; we add spice.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The superdelegates also offer some expertise. These days, Democrats typically have more trust in that quality. Ina Pew survey, 68 percent of politically engaged Republicans said \\u201cordinary Americans would do a better job than elected officials solving the country\\u2019s problems.\\u201d A smaller percentage of Democratic counterparts, 48 percent, felt the same way.\\\",\\\"Maybe expertise shouldn\\u2019t be played down. Many Americansdon\\u2019t knowthat crime is declining, but a lot of them believethat Bigfoot exists. And while Democrats are more likelyto trust experts like scientistswho say humans are causing climate change, they\\u2019re also more likely than Republicansto believe in astrology.\\\",\\\"RepublicansThe party has fewer unbound delegates, and they are based more on the vagaries of state rules, while the Democrats rely more on central planning. (SeveralG.O.P.state delegations won\\u2019t be bound to any candidate).Markets can be messy, and the chances of convention discord seem higher.\\\",\\\"How we got hereConcerned after the doomed nomination of George McGovern in 1972 and a blowout loss by Jimmy Carter in 1980, Democratic Party leadersdecided in the early 1980sto add superdelegates. Part of the idea was to increase the chances of an orderly process in the primaries and at the convention. The thinking was also that superdelegates would have a better feel for who would be a stronger general election candidate. (For example, they would have a better chance of knowing that while Mr. Sanders\\u2019s better polling numbers in head-to-head matchups with Republican candidates are impressive, they arenot necessarily predictive.)\\\",\\\"The practical effectRepublican party elites probably wouldn\\u2019t mind having superdelegates right about now. The headline of a recent FiveThirtyEightarticlewas \\u201cDonald Trump Would Be Easy to Stop Under Democratic Rules.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The conservative columnist Ross Douthatwrotefor The New York Times over the weekend: \\u201cThe less-than-democratic side of party nominations is a virtue of our system, not a flaw, and it has often been a necessary check on the passions (Trumpian or otherwise) that mass democracy constantly threatens to unleash.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Even without superdelegates, Republicans have been plottinghowthey can take the nomination away from Mr. Trump, particularly if he can\\u2019t reach a clinching number of delegates. We could see our firstgenuine convention dramasince 1976. But as Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg View wrote, the weeks before the July conventioncould be even more fascinating.\\\",\\\"On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton has aleadin superdelegates of more than 400,giving the impressionthat her lead is bigger than it is. But as Ms. Brazile noted, \\u201cIf anyone paid attention to 2008, we can change our minds,\\u201d referring to Barack Obama\\u2019s narrow victory over Mrs. Clinton.\\\",\\\"If Mr. Sanders were to dominate the race from here to the finish, the superdelegates would almost certainly switch to his side.\\\",\\\"But if Mr. Sanders wound up overtaking Mrs. Clinton by, say, only two pledged delegates, the superdelegates might not abandon her en masse. A tie or virtual tie would probably go to Mrs. Clinton, the party possibly deciding against the people. But even that probably wouldn\\u2019t be as woundingor chaoticas what might await if a big delegate lead by Mr. Trump were overturned at the Republican convention.\\\",\\\"Question for readers:Anyone can get a trophy, but only one person can become president. Which system do you believe results in the best-qualified nominee?\\\"}\"}"
