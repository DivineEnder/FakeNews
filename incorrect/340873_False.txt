"{\"article_id\": 340873, \"title\": \"Jorge Ramos Is Not Walter Cronkite\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Shortly afterDonald Trump\\u2019s bodyguardforcibly removed himfrom a press conference in Dubuque, Iowa, the Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos declared that the ejection had caught him by surprise. As hetold George Stephanopouloson \\u201cGood Morning America,\\u201d \\u201cNever in my life, and I\\u2019ve been a journalist more than 30 years, have I been thrown out of a press conference.\\u201d Technically, Ramos\\u2019s statement is true. But anyone who has read his books knows that he has tangled with bodyguards before, even if they weren\\u2019t at a press conference.\\\",\\\"In his 2002 memoir, \\u201cNo Borders: A Journalist\\u2019s Search for Home,\\u201d Ramos recounts that in 1991 he was elbowed in the stomach and knocked to the ground by a bodyguard after accosting a politician, peppering him with questions and making an uncomfortable declaration. This time, the politician wasPresident Fidel Castro of Cuba, and what Ramos said was, \\u201cMany people believe that this is the time for you to call for an election.\\u201d At the last word, the bodyguard\\u2019s elbow struck.\\\",\\\"Getting face to face with Castro had taken some creativity. Ramos\\u2019s formal requests for an interview were met with silence, so he and a cameraman ambushed Castro outside a hotel room during the first meeting of the Ibero-American Summit in Guadalajara, Mexico. As Ramos tumbled to the ground, his microphone sailing through the air, he recalls, \\u201cCastro said nothing, he just kept walking, not even turning around to look at me.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In the United States\\u2019 English-language media, it has become routine to describe Ramos as a kind of Mexican-American Walter Cronkite. Yet in his books, the person he presents as his North Star is not Cronkite but Oriana Fallaci, the fierce Italian journalist who faced off with Yasir Arafat, Muammar el-Qaddafi and Ayatollah Khomeini. (Christopher Hitchens was another of heroutspoken admirers.) Henry Kissinger once confessed that his interview with Fallaci \\u2014 in which he called himself a \\u201ccowboy\\u201d and pleaded helplessly for her to stop asking questions about the Vietnam War \\u2014 was \\u201cthe single most disastrous conversation I have ever had with any member of the press.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Reading Fallaci\\u2019s 1976 book, \\u201cInterview With History,\\u201d was a defining moment for Ramos. In the prologue to his 2006 book of interviews. \\u201cDetr\\u00e1s de la m\\u00e1scara\\u201d \\u2014 \\u201cBehind the Mask\\u201d \\u2014 he writes that he became a journalist \\u201cwith Fallaci\\u2019s questions encrusted in my mind.\\u201d (The fact that Fallaci spent her final yearswriting jeremiads against immigration in Europelends some oddity to Ramos\\u2019s admiration.) Ramos\\u2019s clash with Trump, and even his May confrontation with theU.S. House speaker John Boehner, look tame compared with his Fallacian 1996 interview with the sitting Colombian president, Ernesto Samper, in which Ramos asked Samper if he had knowingly received $6 million from the Cali drug cartel for his electoral campaign.\\\",\\\"The morning after the interview, Ramos received two death threats and was rushed back to the United States with his cameraman and his producer. Two years later, when Univision tried to return to Colombia to cover the country\\u2019s presidential elections, floral arrangements arrived at the company\\u2019s offices days before the reporting team\\u2019s planned departure, with a note naming all the journalists scheduled for the journey, including Ramos. Univision canceled the trip.\\\",\\\"When Ramos flew to Venezuela to interview President Hugo Ch\\u00e1vez in 2000, Chavez insisted that theirconversationbe held outside on a cement basketball court, surrounded by a crowd of bodyguards, government ministers and dozens of the president\\u2019s supporters. \\u201cEvery time I asked [Ch\\u00e1vez] something he didn\\u2019t like,\\u201d Ramos writes, \\u201cthe people would boo, and when the president responded, his words were followed by applause.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A few months later, Ramos asked the former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari if he had ordered the assassination of his would-be successor, Luis Donaldo Colosio, in 1994, a death that traumatized Latin American politics for years. Salinas\\u2019s response, transcribed in Ramos\\u2019s 2001 book, \\u201cA la caza del le\\u00f3n\\u201d (\\u201cHunting for the Lion\\u201d), begins with this parry: \\u201cLuis Donaldo Colosio was my dear friend.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Dissatisfied with the absence of an explicit no, Ramos renews his attack: \\u201cI want to ask again: You had nothing to do with Colosio\\u2019s assassination?\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI was among those who lost the most with Colosio\\u2019s death,\\u201d Salinas replies.\\\",\\\"It is precisely this pattern of confrontation \\u2014 not his poker-faced anchoring of the nightly news with his colleague Maria Elena Salinas on \\u201cNoticiero Univisi\\u00f3n\\u201d \\u2014 that has won Ramos the trust of so many Hispanics. They know that in many countries south of the United States, direct questions can provoke not simply a loss of access but also a loss of life.Ramos\\u2019s aggressive reporting on Latin America is possible because he is based in Miami. \\u201cThe United States is my journalistic trench,\\u201d he has written, \\u201cand I am extremely grateful.\\u201d It\\u2019s very unlikely that he expected to contend with bodyguards here.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
