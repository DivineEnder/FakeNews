"{\"title\": \"Mistrust: Added Scene of Detainee Abuse Caused Defense Dept. to Pull 'Hurt Locker' Support\", \"content\": \"At the bottom of this L.A. Times piece  there\\u2019s a fascinating story explaining why \\u201cThe Hurt Locker\\u201d lost their support from the Defense Department at the last minute. It appears as though the government was  perfectly willing to support the production until a couple of  last minute scenes were  added that included detainee abuse  (possibly the David Morse scene I describe here)[emphasis mine]:\\n\\nThe Los Angeles Times:\\n\\nThis might refer to a scene where what are supposed to be Iraqi kids are seen angrily throwing rocks at an American  Humvee.  A scene that seems to say we don\\u2019t want you here.\\n\\n[Screenwriter and producer Mark] Boal said that while the production initially worked with the U.S. military, it parted ways when it became clear they would not approve of \\u201cThe Hurt Locker\\u2019s\\u201d script. He said the producers did not film on a base in Kuwait and never signed a contract.Both  screenwriter/producer Mark Boal, and  military technical advisor Lt. Col. J. Todd Breasseale agree that at one time the U.S. Military was working with the \\u201cHurt Locker\\u201d producers. Then, according to Breasseale, \\u201cscenes were being shot that were not in the script that the Army had approved\\u201d and that he could no longer \\u201ctrust that [\\u201cThe Hurt Locker\\u201d] company [would] honor its contract to the soldiers and government of the U.S.\\u201dBoal\\u2019s response is that no contract was signed, but that\\u2019s taking the word \\u201ccontract\\u201d literally. Even my inital reading of Breasseale\\u2019s comments weren\\u2019t that literal. My first assumption was that he meant an unwritten contract, and if scenes were added after the military had already approved the script   \\u2014 scenes of our guys committing detainee abuse \\u2014 Breasseale is absolutely correct.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 192126}"
