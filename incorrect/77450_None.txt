"{\"title\": \"The strange case of Dr. Keith Ablow\", \"content\": \"The diagnosis, by AP's David Bauder:Over the years, psychiatrist Keith Ablow has diagnosed President Barack Obama as a man with abandonment issues dating back to his upbringing, a person with a victim's mentality who secretly identifies more with Africa than America. ... There's no evidence that Ablow has actually treated the president. Yet the Fox News Channel analyst freely mixes psychiatric assessments with political criticism, a unique twist in the realm of cable news commentary that some medical colleagues find unethical.The defense, from Dr. Ablow himself:As a psychiatrist, news commentator, and medical professional, my analysis is accurate. I stand by what I have said. Psychiatrists are uniquely situated to comment on political figures, and the interface of politics and psychology is improved by psychological analysis. ... While some may be offended by my commentary, it is, nevertheless entirely accurate. ... President Obama provided the data for my commentary through his statements and actions. ...\\u00a0My commentary is accurate, and I will continue to speak truth to power.But here's the real gem: At one point in Bauder's article,\\u00a0Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, chairman of psychiatry at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, diagnoses Ablow as \\\"a narcissistic self-promoter of limited and dubious expertise.\\\"Ablow's response: \\\"Lieberman condemned me as a 'narcissistic self-promoter,' yet he has never interviewed me. From where does this analysis come?\\\"I'd hazard a guess that Dr. Ablow provided the data for Dr. Lieberman's commentary through his statements and actions.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 77450}"
