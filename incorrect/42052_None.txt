"{\"content\": \"Apple is known as Silicon Valley\\u2019s stage master \\u2014 but CEO Tim Cook showed Tuesday he knows how to bring the spectacle to Washington all the same.Even under fire for shielding billions of dollars overseas from U.S. taxes, Cook deftly turned the conversation away from his company and used his first appearance before a congressional committee to shine a harsh spotlight on what he says is a broken tax system.In the end, Apple\\u2019s rigorous, behind-the-scenes preparation with its growing team of lawyers and lobbyists helped Cook and his fellow executives avoid a perilous confrontation with regulators. It also was to Apple\\u2019s benefit that some committee lawmakers devoted as much time to touting their iPhones and sparring with each other as they spent questioning the company\\u2019s corporate conduct.And while Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) told reporters he thought the inquiry was successful, even he acknowledged Apple\\u2019s luster may have blinded a few lawmakers to the serious issues at hand.\\u201cEvery company that has a huge presence, that has a huge number of employees, that pays a lot of taxes, that produces really good products, obviously that has an impact on people\\u2019s thinking,\\u201d Levin said.\\u201cBut before we decide whether to tolerate it, or close the tax loopholes \\u2026 we\\u2019ve got to see it. And maybe it\\u2019s a little bit harder to see in a company which people admire, and I\\u2019m one of them. But it\\u2019s essential we look it square in the face.\\u201dApple\\u2019s appearance before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations initially had the makings of a political showdown. Entering the hearing, panel leaders had produced a report showing Apple dodged taxes on $44 billion in income between 2009 and 2012. And the same panel tangled with Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard leaders last year over those companies\\u2019 controversial tax strategies.With Apple, there\\u2019s long been Washington interest in the more than $100 billion in cash the company maintains overseas \\u2014 money that Apple, like other tech giants, has kept abroad to avoid steep U.S. taxes. But the committee felt Apple, in its own unique way, had exploited tax loopholes and operated in the gaps between U.S. and international laws to lower its yearly tax bills.In effect, Levin said during the hearing, it all amounted to tax \\u201cgimmicks\\u201d depriving U.S. coffers of billions of dollars of much-needed cash. For that reason, he frequently challenged Cook, flanked by two other Apple executives, for the tech giant\\u2019s \\u201cunfair\\u201d behavior.\\u201cThe facts are mighty clear to me that loopholes in our tax laws and regulations allow many companies, including Apple, to shift enormous amounts of income from this country to other countries,\\u201d Levin said to close the hearing.\", \"article_id\": 42052, \"title\": \"Apple's Cook shines in D.C. spotlight\", \"source_id\": 1}"
