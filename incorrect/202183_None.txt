"{\"title\": \"WATCH: Michael Gove, Game of Thrones and How Political Myths are Made\", \"content\": \"What I didn\\u2019t at all expect, though, was that it would go semi-viral. (We\\u2019re not talking Cat Wearing Shark Costume Cleans Kitchen On A Roomba or anything. But it did rack up around 30,000 hits in one day, which beats my previous video record by around 25,000). And the reason it did was because lots of media outlets \\u2013 the Spectator; the Guardian; the Independent; the BBC Daily Politics; Huff Po; the Telegraph; Guido Fawkes \\u2013 were so tickled by its silliness that they couldn\\u2019t resist putting it up.Not, of course, that I\\u2019m remotely complaining that they did so. The only bit that puzzles me is the political subtext which some of them have imposed on it. For example, in The Spectator, the diarist \\u2018Steerpike\\u2019 mischievously suggested that Gove was in some way identifying himself with the \\u201cmisshapen dwarf, reviled throughout his life\\u201d Tyrion Lannister.The Telegraph took a similar line by noting that:Mr Gove himself was recently bumped as Education Secretary during a Cabinet reshuffle amid polls revealing his unpopularity with voters and was tasked instead with party discipline.Guido Fawkes, meanwhile, read the runes and decided that this was a sign that James Delingpole was preparing to abandon UKIP and return to the Conservative fold.But it was the New Statesman \\u2013 not normally my most natural political soulmate \\u2013 which got closest to the mark when it said:Sometimes, strange things happen. You can waste a lot of time trying to work out why and how, or you can just sit back and let the sheer oddness wash over you.Still, the experience has given me a fascinating insight into the nature of politics and our understanding of it. Journalists \\u2013 political journalists especially \\u2013 I realise, are by nature conspiracy theorists: forever in search of deeper meanings, hidden plots and grand designs, even when, as in this case, none actually exists.The infallible rule of Hollywood, they say, is that \\u201cNo one knows anything.\\u201d And I\\u2019m beginning to suspect that similar rules apply to politics. Most of the time, politicians are just too busy \\u2013 and often too stupid or incompetent \\u2013 to engage in all the clever scheming that is so often ascribed to them. When things happen, they are at least as often the result of cock-up, or inertia, or accident or fudge as they are of deliberate intent.Another thing I have learned from this episode is the danger of false modesty. I could have put the video up straight away on Breitbart London but I thought: \\u201cNah. No one will care that much\\u201d \\u2013 with the result that the entire opposition scooped me with my own story.But for those who are still determined to read something into that video, here\\u2019s an interesting thought. I didn\\u2019t prep Gove with that the question; nor had we discussed Game of Thrones beforehand. I just hit him with it straight, and that fluent, detailed response he gave was pretty much instantaneous. Now I\\u2019ve long thought Gove to be a clever mind \\u2013 by far the greatest intellect in the cabinet. But is it maybe possible that I\\u2019ve underestimated him?Does he really possess a brain so quick that with barely a second\\u2019s thought he can suddenly spy an opportunity simultaneously to make himself come across like an amusing guy in touch with popular culture and slip in a sly dig about how personally feels about the way he has been treated by the public and by the Cameron administration?If so then we should all be deeply concerned that a mind so sharp should currently be being wasted on the post of Chief Whip. He shouldn\\u2019t be \\u201cthe Hand of the King\\u201d, as his friend and boss David Cameron has called him. Rather, it\\u2019s Gove himself who should be sitting on the Iron Throne.WATCH:\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 202183}"
