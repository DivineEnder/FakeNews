"{\"content\": \"As Kristol points out, Carter\\u2019s disastrous gambit helped deliver Ronald Reagan to Israel and the world. The full spectrum of the organized American Jewish community in 1980 was proudly pro-Israel and came out swinging against Carter\\u2019s support for an anti-Israel UN resolution.That, by today\\u2019s standards, seems tame. Weeks later, New York\\u2019s Jews came out \\u201cin droves\\u201d to crush Carter in the Democratic Presidential primary.Alas, 2015 is not 1980\\u2014not for the American electorate generally, nor certainly for American Jews.Unlike 1980, when nearly every major American Jewish organization quickly condemned Carter\\u2019s anti-Israel moves, today only two major Jewish groups even bothered to issue immediate condemnations following President Obama\\u2019s threats to use the UN to punish Israel for its crime of re-electing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The groups that did speak out represented the two largest denominations in American Judaism: the Reform and Conservative movements\\u2014and both organizations strongly condemned not Obama, but Netanyahu!The more relevant corollary to the age-old question \\u201cWhy are Jews liberal?\\u201d\\u00a0is \\u201cJust how liberal are\\u00a0American Jews?\\u201d The vicious assault against U.S. Representative Steve King\\u00a0by leading liberal Jews after the Iowa Republican asked why American Jews seem to support Obama much more aggressively than they support Israel shows just how sensitive the matter has become.American Jews are liberal for precisely the same reason that American Christians are Christian. Just as Christianity is the religion of most American Christians, the 2013 Pew Survey on American Jewish Beliefs and Culture\\u00a0shows that liberalism is by far and away the default religion of most American Jews. As American Jews move farther to the left, they grow not only less attached to Israel but increasingly hostile to it.Nearly two thirds of American Jews self-identify as either \\u201cliberal\\u201d or \\u201cprogressive-left,\\u201d the survey found. Most American Jews believe the federal government is \\u201cnot as big as it should be\\u201d and nine out of 10 support gay marriage. A higher percentage of American Jews believe Muslims suffer serious discrimination in the United States than do American Muslims themselves. Three quarters of American Jews consider \\u201cHolocaust remembrance\\u201d\\u2014not Judaism itself\\u2014as the \\u201cmost essential part of being Jewish.\\u201d While the Pew study didn\\u2019t quiz American Jews as to how much actual knowledge they even have of the Holocaust, one wonders.But the study\\u2019s most shocking finding was how openly hostile much of the American Jewish community has become towards the Jewish state. Fewer than one in three American Jews have ever even visited Israel.\\u00a0Jewish support for Obama\\u2019s disparaging treatment of Israel is higher than for Americans at large. Almost two thirds of US Jews surveyed in the Pew Study\\u00a0(65 percent) agree with the statement that current \\u201cUS support for Israel\\u201d is either\\u00a0\\u201cabout right or even too much.\\u201d The study did not break down the percentage split between \\u201cabout right\\u201d and \\u201ctoo much,\\u201d nor was \\u201cUS\\u201d specified to mean either the White House\\u2019s position, the U.S. Congress, both, or neither.The anti-Israel hatred of the newly emergent American Jewish left has been on full display in the week since Obama\\u2019s combined two front attacks against the Jewish state\\u2014his blatant attempts to incite Israel\\u2019s terrorist enemies by legitimizing them at the United Nations while feverishly pursuing an alliance with Iran that will guarantee nuclear weapons for the world\\u2019s leading terrorist nation that claims the violent annihilation of Israel to be its paramount ideological pursuit.Things have become so\\u00a0Orwellian inside the American Jewish community that being pro-Israel requires one to be anti-Israel. At its annual conference, the anti-Israel, left-wing Jewish group J Street wildly cheered anti-Israel speeches from former White House Chief of Staff James Baker III, recently appointed as a top foreign policy advisor to Jeb Bush, along with current White House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough, both of whom used the same chilling language used by Israel\\u2019s worst enemies to condemn the Jewish state.American Jewish writer Peter Beinart used Netanyahu\\u2019s re-election as a pretext to elevate himself from mere anti-Israel agitator into a full blown anti-Semite. Parroting calls previously made by other anti-Israel hate groups, Beinart demands that Obama assist in the ethnic cleansing of Jews from \\u201coccupied territories\\u201d by banning them en masse from entering the US and freezing any financial assets they might hold here.The reaction of the organized American Jewish community to a prominent pundit from its own midst calling upon a US president to forcibly ghettoize and seize the assets of Jews in Israel? There wasn\\u2019t one.While new groups of the well-funded, anti-Israel Jewish left grow in size and scope, the older more established institutions of the American Jewish community have either rendered themselves mute, like AIPAC, or are simply being\\u00a0taken over by the anti-Israel Jewish left, like the United Jewish Appeal,\\u00a0the largest and most storied of all US Jewish groups.The UJA\\u2019s just\\u00a0elected Aliza Doctoroff its new president. Doctoroff is not from your mother\\u2019s UJA. She is an open supporter and donor to the notorious New Israel Fund,\\u00a0a major sponsor of the anti-Semitic BDS (Boycott, Divest and Sanctions) movement that demonizes and delegitimizes the Jewish state, and therefore by extension, the Jewish people. Doctoroff\\u2019s NIF has openly called for\\u00a0the extradition of soldiers from the Israel Defense Forces to stand trial before United Nations war crimes tribunals.Israel is not just being abandoned and betrayed by President Obama, it is betrayed and abandoned by the\\u00a0American Jewish community\\u2014or what\\u2019s left of it.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 169095, \"title\": \"The Deafening Silence of American Jewry in Defense of Israel\"}"
