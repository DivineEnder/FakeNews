"{\"title\": \"Jobs trend may help Obama keep his\", \"content\": \"Presidential elections almost always turn on the state of the economy.So, President Barack Obama should be feeling good as he kicks off his reelection campaign this week, despite polls showing the public has little confidence in his handling of the issue.The discrepancy between current views and the Democratic president\\u2019s reelection odds can be attributed to one fact: It\\u2019s the trends that matter. And right now, the economic trend lines, despite shocks from Japan and the Middle East, appear to be headed in the right direction.The Labor Department last week reported that the economy added 216,000 jobs in March, the second consecutive month of gains near 200,000. And the unemployment rate dropped from 8.9 percent to 8.8 percent.The drop was partly the result of discouraged workers no longer looking for employment. But election data compiled by Hamilton Place Strategies suggest that Obama should be in solid shape for reelection as long as the economy continues to add at least 185,000 jobs a month and the unemployment rate dips below 8 percent by Election Day 2012.Actually, the trend has been improving for a longer time than many realize.As Commerce Department Chief Economist Mark Doms recently noted, revisions to initial employment data mean the average monthly jobs gain has actually been 143,000 since last summer.Unless world events intervene in a major way, or inflation spikes beyond expectations, getting unemployment below 8 percent should be an achievable goal. In fact, hiring could take off in a much more substantial way given the massive amounts of cash on corporate balance sheets.Data also suggest consumers are in a stronger position than during the worst of the crisis \\u2014 having pared down debt, leaving more room to spend.Already, Intrade, a predictor of political outcomes, has Obama\\u2019s reelection odds at 59 percent. That helps explain why the Republican field of potential opponents seems fractured and weak.To beat Obama, the GOP nominee will have to convince Americans that they are not better off than they were in 2008. This will be difficult, because of the dire state of the economy when Obama took office at the height of the Great Recession.Republicans will still have many economic issues on which to attack the president, particularly the massive national debt and the reluctance of the administration to take the political risk inherent in any proposal to deal with the problem.But even here, an improving economy is likely to blunt any GOP advantage, since rising tax revenues tend to make deficit numbers look a whole lot better.\\u201cAll of a sudden, government deficits can look much better, and overall confidence among consumers and CEOs can look better as well,\\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \\u201cThat\\u2019s kind of the elephant in the room right now.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 111886}"
