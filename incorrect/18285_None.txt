Dennis Kucinich this morning released the letter he has been circulating to his party to take his party's top spot on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.Kucinich is looking to pick off New York Democratic Rep. Ed Towns, who has been the top Democrat on the panel for the past two years. The news of his letter was first reported Tuesday night by POLITICO.The race will likely touch off a battle between Democratic leadership and the Congressional Black Caucus, which is hardly going to be pleased if one of its members loses a chairmanship.Kucinich calls the vote for the top Democrat on the committee \\u201cperhaps the most crucial vote you will cast\\u201d as in the organization of the new Congress. That\\u2019s because the panel's incoming chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.),\\u00a0is planning a slew of investigations, and Kucinich thinks that Issa has made \\u201cwild and unsubstantiated charges which threaten to turn the principal oversight committee of the House into a witch hunt.\\u201dKucinich is laying out the pillars for his approach to the committee: no tolerance for \\u201csmears and innuendo,\\u201d a \\u201cteam approach,\\u201d weekly updates of oversight, cooperation with Issa when he \\u201cproceeds in an even-handed manner,Kucinich is\\u00a0not\\u00a0coy about his thoughts on Issa and hints that Towns isn\\u2019t up to the challenge.\\u201cWe cannot simply stand by idly and hope that such a reckless approach to the use of the power of the chair will not happen, especially since it is not only being promised, but demonstrated by the person who will hold the gavel,\\u201d Kucinich wrote.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
