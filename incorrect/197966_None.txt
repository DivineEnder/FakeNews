In essence, in many [cases], we\\u2019re reminiscent of that era in which America appeared to be decline in the eyes of the world. And today, now we have president and a country that\\u2019s been relegated to second-tier with regards to the Russians and what they\\u2019re doing under Vladimir Putin, at the UN this week, and so forth. It now appears like he\\u2019s the one that\\u2019s leading the charge and taking bold stands. But look, let\\u2019s not be confused\\u2026the first airstrikes they conducted were [in] an area that quite frankly, neither ISIS nor al-Nusra [are] overly active. It\\u2019s areas that they\\u2019re targeting other opponents of the Assad regime, and this \\u2014 they know are going to have a permanent air base, of significant magnitude, in Syria, as a way to project power regionally, and in direct competition with our interests in the region.\\u201dRubio further blamed the president\\u2019s equivocation and unreliability as a player in the Middle East for Russia\\u2019s rise. Rubio added that if he was president, \\u201cwe wouldn\\u2019t be in this situation. Three years ago, I advocated that we needed to do something. I advocated, let\\u2019s go to these generals that are defecting the Assad army, let\\u2019s go to these defectors, not radical jihadists, defectors who want to get rid of Assad, and let\\u2019s work with them so they can be the ones that replace him.\\u201dHe continued that he doesn\\u2019t \\u201cenvision any time in the near future where Syria can be a functioning nation-state along its existing borders\\u2013,\\u201d and that Russia now has \\u201can air power component to their influence in the region. And look, just today, as they announced that they were going to conduct these airstrikes, there were open media reports that the Russians warned the US, do not have any planes in this area, because we\\u2019re operating here. I mean, this will lead to the prospect of potential conflict with [the] Russian Air Force in the region, and so forth.\\u201dRubio concluded, \\u201cin the eyes of the world, we look like we are weak. We look like we\\u2019re indecisive. We look less influential, at the expense of a gangster in Moscow named Vladimir Putin.\\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 197966}"
