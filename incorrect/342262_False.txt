"{\"title\": \"Ben Carson Fans in Iowa Stand by Their Man and Against the News Media\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 342262, \"content\": \"{\\\"DES MOINES \\u2014  As he faces a swirl of questions about whether elements of his compelling biography are true,Ben Carsonis finding stubborn allies: his many fans in Iowa, who are shrugging off accusations that he made things up, calling them reflective of news media bias.\\\",\\\"Mr. Carson first broke into the top tier of the Republican presidential race by dint of his character more than his policies. Supporters said in interviews that his inspiring life, in which he climbed from poverty to the heights of brain surgery, mattered more than scrupulous accuracy of all he had said about his past, including an offer of a West Point scholarship, his attempted stabbing of a friend at 14 or his proving himself the one honest student in a Yale course.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe\\u2019s a human being, he\\u2019s entitled to some pride,\\u201d said Gary Walke, a retired social studies teacher in Sumner, acknowledging that Mr. Carson may have embellished details of his biography. \\u201cMaybe his ego got in the way.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Walke said on Monday that even though vetting may have uncovered apparent discrepancies in Mr. Carson\\u2019s books and speeches, he remained a \\u201c100 percentBen Carsonsupporter.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe attractiveness to me of his candidacy and his leadership for our country has not been diminished at all,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Others made similar points in interviews after several days of articles that have unraveled threads in Mr. Carson\\u2019s life story. Last week, he acknowledged that he had never been accepted to West Point, though he had earlier seemed to suggest so in his widely read memoir, \\u201cGifted Hands.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Even if Mr. Carson did stretch some details, said Bob Klaus, a billboard salesman in Cedar Rapids, that was outweighed by the good he accomplished as a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon. \\u201cIt makes up for multiple sins, if you will,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Many Carson supportersechoed accusationsthat he was being singularly targeted by liberal news outlets. Over the weekend, noting that donations were pouring in, to the tune of $3.5 million since the first articles broke,Mr. Carson wroteon Twitter, \\u201cThank you biased media.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe just blow off the media,\\u201d said Lorraine Stumbo, a retired piano teacher in Ames who supports Mr. Carson. \\u201cWe stopped getting the newspaper. We watch Fox News and listen to the radio.\\u201d\\\",\\\"To Ms. Stumbo, it was a matter of \\u201csemantics\\u201d that Mr. Carson wrote of turning down a full scholarship from West Point, although he received only an informal assurance he could get in, as he clarified on Friday.\\\",\\\"Ms. Stumbo brought upHillary Rodham Clinton\\u2019s recent testimonyto the House Select Committee on Benghazi. \\u201cHow is Hillary still out there with the evidence of her lying multiple times and the media not just crushing her?\\u201d she asked.\\\",\\\"Over the weekend, Mr. Carson took to Facebook to push back on reporting by CNN that former friends from Detroit could not verify his attempted stabbing of a friend. Mr. Carson has called the episode from his childhood a turning point, when he renounced violent impulses and opened himself to Christianity.\\\",\\\"He has said neither his brother nor other family members who could verify the episode are willing to be interviewed. On Sunday, Donald J. Trump raised an eyebrow about the incident, strongly suggesting his Republican rival invented it.\\\",\\\"Mr. Carson posted a picture of an interview his mother, Sonya Carson, gave to Parade magazine in 1997. It quotes her saying of the attempted stabbing, \\u201cOh, that really happened.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Carson alsoposted on Facebookresponses to reporting byThe Wall Street Journalinto an episode when he was a Yale undergraduate. In \\u201cGifted Hands,\\u201d Mr. Carson wrote of being the only student in a course called Perceptions 301 willing to retake a test, after which he was photographed by The Yale Daily News as the most honest student in the course.\\\",\\\"The Journal found no evidence of the photograph in the campus newspaper\\u2019s archives, and a college librarian said there was no record of the course in catalogs of that era. Mr. Carson posted a 1970 article from the student paper describing the makeup test as a prank perpetrated by The Yale Record, a campus humor magazine.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWill an apology be coming. I doubt it,\\u201dhe wrote.\\\",\\\"Another person busy on social media, Rita Davenport, who is a county chairwoman for a \\u201csuper PAC\\u201d supporting Mr. Carson, posted information to counter articles questioning her candidate\\u2019s veracity.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNot everybody who\\u2019s thinking about supporting Dr. Carson is all in,\\u201d said Ms. Davenport, an academic adviser at a community college in Boone. \\u201cThere\\u2019s people who are easily confused.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But, she added, referring to news accounts of Mr. Carson, \\u201cthey really haven\\u2019t shown anything we couldn\\u2019t later poke holes in.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe knew this was going to happen,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe stand by our candidate.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Some voters considering supporting Mr. Carson, but not entirely on board yet, were less quick to blame the news media. They agreed with former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who said on Monday that Mr. Carson needed to grow a thicker skin as a newcomer to the top tier of the Republican race.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019d like for him to have more experience handling the media,\\u201d said Phil Cavanaugh, a co-chairman of theRepublican Partyof Wapello County, who considers Mr. Carson one of his top three choices. He said he would be watching carefully for how Mr. Carson handled the inevitable questions about his biography at the Republican debate on Tuesday night in Milwaukee.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe want people to be accurate about their story and their history,\\u201d Mr. Cavanaugh said. But he suggested that Mr. Carson should turn the tables and ask why more vetting was not done of President Obama.\\\"}\"}"
