The assailant poisoned the police officers and then allowed inTalibanforces, who killed all of the officers, he said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhat he did was unbelievable,\\u201d said Mr. Khan, who added that the attacker, who is still at large, said over the phone to him that he had killed his cousin and the other police officers. Mr. Khan would not identify the assailant because the investigation was continuing.\\\",\\\"The attack raised alarm among provincial officials of a new tactic by resurgentTalibanagainst the Afghan security forces. In all three attacks over the past two weeks, an assailant or assailants used insider connections or dressed as officers to gain access to a police checkpoint.\\\",\\\"In two of the attacks, including the most recent, the perpetrator was a guest who had stayed for days at or around the checkpoint. In a third attack, the assailants were dressed as police officers. After each attack, officials said, the assailants fled and took with them the victims\\u2019 weapons.\\\",\\\"Afghan security forces, which have taken charge of security across the country, have suffered heavycasualties and setbacksthis year. The American-led international coalition force here, which numbered more than 100,000 at its peak, has largely drawn down to a training and advising mission.\\\",\\\"Mohammad Jan Rasolyaar, the deputy governor of Helmand, said that before the recent attacks instructions had been issued to police commanders not to allow civilians to stay at their checkpoints, but those rules were repeatedly broken.\\\",\\\"\\u201cUnfortunately, this is the third incident that has happened in Helmand Province,\\u201d Mr. Rasolyaar said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to know or track down the assailant because all the policemen who knew or invited him have been killed.

After staying at the checkpoint commander\\u2019s home for several nights, the attacker appeared to have persuaded his cousin to take him to the checkpoint, Mr. Khan said.\\\",\\\"On Aug. 11, Taliban wearing police uniforms and driving in \\u201cgovernment-confiscated vehicles\\u201d entered a checkpoint in the Musa Qala district, according to Nasir Ahmad Shakir, head of the security committee of the Helmand provincial council. The Taliban claimed they were friends ofGen.
