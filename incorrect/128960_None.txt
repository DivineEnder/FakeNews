Many people are even saying that I should go for an abortion.\\u201dDespite the threats, she kept the baby and is currently seven months into the pregnancy. The community threatened her life, along with the baby\\u2019s. The men made it clear \\u201cthey will not tolerate the children of Boko Haram living amongst them.\\u201d A\\u00a0few vigilantes who fight against the terrorist group, however, do not believe a militant impregnated Haleema.\\u201cI am not aware of any woman in this village who was impregnated by them,\\u201d stated one man. \\u201cIf any woman is found to be pregnant, in our tradition, the pregnancy is considered Haram (unlawful), hence we cannot accept them wholeheartedly because they can be like baby snakes.\\u201dLuckily for Haleema, her family is on her side. Her mother refuses to even consider abortion.\\u201cWe heard about one girl who died after she attempted an abortion, losing both the mother and the baby,\\u201d she explained. \\u201cThe girl was the only child to her mother, so that scared us. If God wishes, she will give birth safely. Life is in the hands of God alone.\\u201dHaleema said her child deserves to live.Women captured by the terrorist group are slowly returning home. In May, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) also reported that five babies were born in three days in refugee camps in Sokoto State. The Nigerian army recently rescued these new mothers, along with hundreds of others from Boko Haram camps. About 700 women were rescued, over 200 of them \\u201cvisibly pregnant.\\u201d The terrorist group has kidnapped over 2,000 women in the past five years, attempting to establish its own Caliphate. Human rights organizations claimed the militants raped and sold the women into sex slavery, which led to fears of future terrorism in Nigeria.\\u201cI am seriously worried with the fact that most women tend to hate and abandon children they deliver from rape,\\u201d said Borno State Governor Kashim Shettima. \\u201cNow, the problem is that these children could go to the streets unattended to, they then lack access to food, health care and education. The result is that they could indeed inherit their fathers\\u2019 (ideology) somehow.\\u201d\", \"article_id\": 128960, \"source_id\": 2, \"title\": \"Pregnant Boko Haram Victim: I'm Keeping My Captor's Baby\"}"
