Now that Republican leaders are trying to restart the process by putting the spending bills on the floor, some lawmakers might prefer to return to the broken model.\\\",\\\"The past few days on Capitol Hill have been a vivid reminder that a wide-open floor fight with dozens of politically charged amendments on bills can cause uncomfortable moments for lawmakers who have grown accustomed to dodging difficult votes.\\\",\\\"Case in point: Republican leaders allowed a vote on an amendment by Representative Jared Huffman, Democrat of California, to prohibit the display of Confederate flags in national veteran cemeteries. \\u201cThe Confederate battle flag, a symbol of hate and opposition to the United States of America, has no place, no place, on government property,\\u201d Mr. Huffman said. No one spoke publicly against his amendment, which passed on a 265-159 vote.\\\",\\\"Top Republican leaders such as Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, sided with the Democrats. Just one Democrat, Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr. of Georgia, joined 158 Republicans, many from the South, in opposition.\\\",\\\"The flag amendment proved so problematic last year that John A. Boehner, then the House speaker, pretty much shut down the appropriations process rather than face the vote. But Mr. Ryan said lawmakers needed to brace for more challenging votes in the weeks to come.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe have to get through these things,\\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters. \\u201cPeople are going to have to take tough votes. And I think people are acknowledging this.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
