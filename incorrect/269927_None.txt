"{\"title\": \"Al Gore's Climate Exchange Utterly Fails... Media Ignores It All\", \"content\": \"Al Gore\\u2019s much ballyhooed Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) has recently announced that it will no longer be engaging in carbon trading, an activity that was the sole purpose that it was created. This is an utter failure of purpose in global warming hysteria yet the Old Media is almost completely silent on this colossal failure.Why has the media remained utterly quite on this abject failure after unleashing on the public an avalanche of stories that touted the creation of the CCX back in 2000 \\u2014 and since for that matter?  Roger L. Simon and David Thomson wonder just that.\\n\\nBut as of the October 21 announcement that carbon trading would end, the Old Media is nowhere to be seen on the story.\\n\\nThe main reason that the CCX has failed, of course, is because the world has cooled for global warming. With the recent election results in the U.S. cap and trade is as much as a dead issue and even other nations are shying away from Kyoto-styled global warming laws that tend to crush economies while offering little by way of global warming fixes.Worse, with the emergence of the lies and obfuscation by global warming religionists as evinced in the email chain from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, the credibility of global warming pseudo science has taken a major hit. It all looks like globaloney at this point.On top of all that is the worldwide depression that has hit us all. The depression has also helped destroy the starry eyed nonsense that is carbon trading. Rich societies with nothing else to do with their money might have the resources for such silliness, but countries in the grip of depression have more important (and true) things to worry about.Still, the question of why the media has ignored this story is quite pertinent. One would think that if such an effort from the right had failed so miserably to succeed the Old Media would be pushing this news by leading every news cast, every TV report, and filling up the front page of every news paper with the tale. Yet this magnificent failure of the leftest of left-wing causes leaves the Old Media utterly silent.It\\u2019s quite telling, isn\\u2019t it?\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 269927}"
