"{\"title\": \"53 Reps Send Letter to Obama: What Did You Know About Benghazi?\", \"content\": \"The attacks took place on April 6 and June 6, 2012.\\u00a0The 53 Reps are particularly interested in knowing whether information regarding these two attacks was placed within the President\\u2019s Daily Brief, as it should have been. And if so, exactly when was it placed in the brief?In both the April and June attacks, bombs were either thrown over the walls of the consulate or placed upon the walls. The Reps believe Obama\\u2019s answers to their questions will help them get a clearer picture of what Obama knew and didn\\u2019t know, as well as what he did and didn\\u2019t do, as Sept 11 was approaching.The letter was also given to Sec. of State Hillary Clinton. The Reps ask:What role did Ambassador Stevens\\u2019 assessment of the security environment in Libya, the large number of security incidents, and their increase in sophistication and coordination play in the Department of State\\u2019s security decision with respect to the U.S. compound in Benghazi?\\u00a0The letter seems to carry a not-so-subtle message to both Obama and Clinton. And that message is that the 53 Reps are convinced not simply that Sept 11 wasn\\u2019t spontaneous, but that it was the culmination of numerous and progressively more coordinated attacks earlier in the year.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 257984}"
