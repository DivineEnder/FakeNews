"{\"content\": \"The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its longest losing streak in nearly six years, reflecting investors\\u2019 doubts about the Trump administration\\u2019s ability to enact its agenda.The blue-chip index fell for an eighth straight trading day Monday, declining 0.2% in the session after Republicans failed to pass their health-care overhaul. Investors and analysts widely viewed the bill as a key test of the administration\\u2019s ability to implement its policies.The selling marked the latest blow to postelection bets on higher growth and inflation that had sent stocks and the dollar soaring while sparking a selloff in government bonds. On Monday, the WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, touched its lowest level since early November as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.373%, the lowest yield in a month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 45.74 points, or 0.2%, to 20550.98 Monday.

At the time, the U.S. government was embroiled in a debate about whether to raise the debt ceiling--a disagreement that in part led rating firm Standard & Poor\\u2019s to downgrade the country\\u2019s credit rating, saying the trajectory of future U.S. debt was unsustainable. In the month after that streak, the Dow fell another 5.3%.More recently, the Dow\\u2019s stumble echoes a nine-session drift lower for the S&P 500 last fall, when investors shed stocks as polls tightened heading into Election Day after a contentious campaign season. What followed was a rapid rally that sent major U.S. stock indexes to records. In February, the Dow industrials rose for 12 consecutive days, its longest stretch of gains since 1987, according to WSJ Market Data Group.Some analysts said the market\\u2019s current listlessness was natural as investors assessed whether the so-called Trump trade was winding down.\\u201cPeople are in pause mode right now,\\u201d said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at \\n        Charles Schwab\\n         Corp.\\n      , who said he recommends that clients be cautious and wait for a couple of up days before jumping into stocks.U.S. stock-trading volumes on March 20 were the lowest of 2017 so far, according to the WSJ Market Data Group.\\u201cInvestors notoriously wait for a pullback to buy, but then when we see one they get nervous,\\u201d said Mr. Frederick.Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com and Aaron Kuriloff at aaron.kuriloff@wsj.comAppeared in the Mar. 28, 2017, print edition as 'Dow\\u2019s Losing Streak Is Longest Since 2011.'\", \"source_id\": 22245, \"article_id\": 349604, \"title\": \"Dow suffers longest losing streak since 2011\"}"
