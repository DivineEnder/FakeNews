"{\"article_id\": 339809, \"title\": \"Norman Lear and Seth MacFarlane and Their TV Families\", \"content\": \"{\\\"At 92 years old, and right on time, Norman Lear, the legendary television writer and producer, jogged up the steps of Baltaire, a restaurant in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Seth MacFarlane, a fellow sitcom creator and filmmaker, followed soon after \\u2014 in more ways than one.\\\",\\\"Mr. Lear is one of the most prolific hitmakers in TV history. For several years in the 1970s, he had seven shows on the air, including \\u201cAll in the Family,\\u201d \\u201cMaude\\u201d and \\u201cThe Jeffersons,\\u201d five of them among the top 10 most popular in the nation, watched by an estimated 120 million viewers a week. His memoir, \\u201cEvenThisI Get to Experience,\\u201d was published last year.\\\",\\\"Mr. MacFarlane, 41, treads a similar path. He created \\u201cFamily Guy,\\u201d which will begin its 14th season in the fall, and two other animated shows. As a singer, he recorded two albums of music from the American songbook. He also wrote and directed \\u201cTed,\\u201d the highest-grossing original R-rated film of all time, lending his voice to its profane computer-generated teddy bear. \\u201cTed 2\\u201d opens this weekend.\\\",\\\"Over lobster salad for Mr. Lear and a blueberry muffin and coffee for Mr. MacFarlane (\\u201cI\\u2019m mildly hung over,\\u201d he said), the pair, each known for speaking out on liberal causes, discussed changes in American television and society (for better and worse) since Mr. Lear\\u2019s heyday; the personal price of grueling schedules; and the theme songs of their most famous shows.\\\",\\\"Philip Galanes:Seth\\u2019s show\\u201cFamily Guy\\u201d beginsthe same way \\u201cAll in the Family\\u201d did: with a couple at a piano, bemoaning progress and singing about the loss of family values.\\\",\\\"Norman Lear:I could sue for that!\\\",\\\"Seth MacFarlane:You could take me for every cent I\\u2019ve got. But in the animation business, we call that \\u201chomage.\\u201d That\\u2019s what keeps us from getting sued. But our song really was a tribute. Because most people in comedy agree that \\u201cAll in the Family\\u201d was the most brilliant comedy series in the history of TV.\\\",\\\"NL:In the \\u201970s.\\\",\\\"SM:Ever. I just watched the episode where Archie writes a letter to Nixon. Edith sits down to write while Archie dictates, but she fixes her hair first \\u2014 out of respect for the president. That little touch is so absent from sitcoms today. That subtlety and intelligence.\\\",\\\"PG:You both explore society through its fools. But when Archie, or any of Norman\\u2019s bigots, said something racist or sexist, there was always another character to call him on it. The show told us what was right. It\\u2019s trickier today. On \\u201cFamily Guy,\\u201d characters say horrible things, but no one corrects them. You leave it to the audience to know better. Is it pass\\u00e9 to scold?\\\",\\\"SM:We still get the note to have another character tell them it\\u2019s wrong. And when it\\u2019s needed, I do. But if it feels like talking down to the audience \\u2014 because in 2015, they\\u2019re more tolerant, in some ways, than they were in the \\u201970s \\u2014 I resist it.\\\",\\\"NL:Also, I grew up in a family that argued. Herbie Gardner talked about a family that lived at the end of their nerves and the top of their lungs. That was us. I remember my grandfather once accused my father of sleeping with my mother\\u2019s brother\\u2019s wife. There\\u2019s my mother, on her knees, begging them to stop. And they\\u2019re screaming over her head. Arguing was my life.\\\",\\\"PG:But there\\u2019s a difference. When a \\u201cFamily Guy\\u201d character makes a joke about gay sex, I laugh, as a gay guy, because I think the character is an idiot. But I\\u2019ve seen homophobes laughing too, in a different way.\\\",\\\"SM:But that\\u2019s nothing new. A certain crowd was laughing at Archie, and another was right with him. You can\\u2019t control that.\\\",\\\"NL:Absolutely. Richard Nixon was on tape, authenticating what Seth just said. He thought we were making fun of a good man with Archie.\\\",\\\"PG:But isn\\u2019t that having it both ways \\u2014 skewering the stereotype and reveling in it, too?\\\",\\\"SM:There are still men like Archie Bunker out there. There may be fewer of them, but they\\u2019re still there.\\\",\\\"PG:So, better to air the ugly idea?\\\",\\\"SM:I often wonder if \\u201cAll in the Family\\u201d was on today, would there be the parade of blogs and think pieces we get now. \\u201cArchie used the N-word! This is outrageous! This shouldn\\u2019t be on TV!\\u201d People have gotten less tolerant because they can\\u2019t process context the way they used to.\\\",\\\"NL:I would agree with that.\\\",\\\"SM:We did an episode of \\u201cFamily Guy,\\u201d where Quagmire\\u2019s father undergoes a transgender operation. The whole point of the episode was that Quagmire is uneasy with it, but he comes to realize: Oh, this is still my parent, the Navy hero I grew up with. I thought it would be well received by the community. I couldn\\u2019t have been more wrong. Today, we get nit-picking over words and a million sound bites.\\\",\\\"PG:Let\\u2019s explore that. When President Clinton gave Norman the National Medal of Arts,he said, \\u201cNorman Lear has held up a mirror to American society and changed the way we look at it.\\u201d But aren\\u2019t we still too uncomfortable to tell the truth about what we see in that mirror?\\\",\\\"NL:We have lived with Judeo-Christian ethics for 2,000 years. Look around. It\\u2019s horrific and amazing where we are. I would have to be a horse\\u2019s ass to think my little shows could change something that all of humanity couldn\\u2019t.\\\",\\\"PG:But wouldn\\u2019t honest conversation \\u2014\\u2014\\\",\\\"SM:Not today. If you make a thoughtful statement, or even ask a question about an uncomfortable subject today, you are pounced on by a thousand different media outlets that will eat you for breakfast.\\\",\\\"PG:Because it\\u2019s not P.C.?\\\",\\\"SM:Partially, but it\\u2019s more than that. There\\u2019s a whole industry that piles on, and it\\u2019s a harmful industry because it\\u2019s made people resistant to speak their minds. It doesn\\u2019t matter what you believe personally if they can fix their mold of what they want you to be.\\\",\\\"NL:America\\u2019s biggest export is excess. We are excessive about everything. And we\\u2019ve become consumers of excess rather than citizens. Media doesn\\u2019t inform so much as it argues, bumper-sticker-style. Context is everything, and we get very little context now. We just get the \\u201cBoom!\\u201d\\\",\\\"PG:Give me an example.\\\",\\\"SM:After I hosted the Oscars, I read a lot of angry articles calling me a misogynist. I thought, Do you even know what that means? That\\u2019s someone who hates or mistrusts women. And these are the women in my life: my manager, my accountant, the producer who runs all my animated shows, my architect. How can both these things be true? They can\\u2019t.\\\",\\\"PG:Are you saying we missed the point of your Oscars number \\u201cWe Saw Your Boobs\\u201d? Why so many naked women and no naked men?\\\",\\\"SM:What I\\u2019m saying is the massive overflow of media \\u2014 too much media \\u2014 has made it harder to have a discussion. The freedom to find answers through communication is punished when things are picked apart and used for profit as sound bites.\\\",\\\"PG:Let\\u2019s shift gears. You are both amazingly prolific. Norman\\u2019s seven shows on the air at once; Seth\\u2019s animated empire \\u2014 plus \\u201cTed.\\u201d\\\",\\\"SM:I ain\\u2019t got the seven. There\\u2019s only one Norman Lear.\\\",\\\"PG:But you did work so hard at one point that you were hospitalized for exhaustion.\\\",\\\"SM:That only happened once.\\\",\\\"PG:Where does the drive come from?\\\",\\\"SM:Necessity \\u2014 when you look at your schedule and see 900 things on it and having no choice but to accomplish those tasks.\\\",\\\"NL:But before that, the drive comes from an appetite for sharing and giving \\u2014 and for enjoying that.\\\",\\\"SM:I never wanted to do more than one show at a time. \\u201cFamily Guy\\u201d got canceled, so I created \\u201cAmerican Dad.\\u201d Then \\u201cFamily Guy\\u201d got picked up again. Suddenly, I had two shows, which I didn\\u2019t really want.\\\",\\\"NL:So, why did you do it?\\\",\\\"SM:That\\u2019s a good question. I don\\u2019t know.\\\",\\\"PG:Nine out of 10 shrinks would point to your parents.\\\",\\\"NL:Well, I had a mother who, when I scored the most, didn\\u2019t have the appetite to say anything. When I called to tell her the Television Academy was starting a Hall of Fame, and the first honorees were Bill Paley, Edward R. Murrow, Milton Berle, Lucille Ball, Paddy Chayefsky, David Sarnoff and me, she said, \\u201cWell, if that\\u2019s what they want to do, who am I to say?\\u201d\\\",\\\"SM:There\\u2019s your answer.\\\",\\\"PG:It\\u2019s a funny story, but I\\u2019m sorry it happened.\\\",\\\"SM:My family wasn\\u2019t like that. My parents worked three jobs to put me through art school because I wanted to get into animation. So, if you were going to dig deep, maybe the drive came from a desire to make it worth their while. Not screw up the opportunity they gave me. I have a hard time buying that myself, but I\\u2019m not a therapist.\\\",\\\"PG:One of the most touching parts of Norman\\u2019s memoir is looking back at himself as a husband and father.\\\",\\\"NL:I had five families on the air and one on Mooncrest Drive. And I started asking myself: How does a good guy \\u2014 and I am a good guy \\u2014 give more to the five families on TV than the one he\\u2019s living with? We had some great parties and took some great trips. But I was producing those moments, from the outside, not living them. Yes, I went to the soccer match, but I wasn\\u2019t really present.\\\",\\\"PG:How did you realize that?\\\",\\\"NL:Writing the book, all these years later. Just being aware of it has changed me. I can\\u2019t believe some of the insights I\\u2019ve had in my 90s.\\\",\\\"SM:I remember better now when my mother was alive. She\\u2019d call me after the show aired. \\u201cThat was hilarious,\\u201d she\\u2019d say, \\u201cthe best one yet.\\u201d You were never going to get a bad review from her. And those calls were more important to me, personally and professionally, than any rating that ever came in.\\\",\\\"PG:Can you see taking a page from Norman\\u2019s book, away from storytelling and focusing on social and political issues?\\\",\\\"SM:I can\\u2019t see \\u2014\\u2014\\\",\\\"NL:Wait, I never woke up and said, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to start an organization today.\\u201d I wanted to do a film savaging the religious right the way Paddy Chayefsky savaged network television in \\u201cNetwork.\\u201d Then one day, I saw a televangelist ask his congregation to pray for the removal of a Supreme Court justice. I thought, Damn! We don\\u2019t have time for a film. So, I made a public service announcement with the support of religious leaders. It said, \\u201cIf anyone, even a minister, tells you that you are a good or bad Christian based on your political beliefs, that\\u2019s not the American way.\\u201d I liked that language. That\\u2019s how we startedPeople for the American Way.\\\",\\\"SM:And I\\u2019m trying to take a cue from my friend here in \\u201cTed 2.\\u201d It\\u2019s a civil rights story about Ted trying to be recognized for his personhood by the courts so he can marry and have a baby. And we handle it as realistically as we can, given that it\\u2019s a talking teddy bear. I doubt there\\u2019s another business where I could tell a story I care about that\\u2019s also fun and entertaining.\\\",\\\"PG:And reaches so many people. Seeing the first \\u201cTed,\\u201d I was in a theater with all these different crowds \\u2014 packs of boys, couples on dates, families, even with kids who seemed a little young for the humor.\\\",\\\"NL:Those kids you just referred to will survive everything in \\u201cTed\\u201d much easier than they\\u2019ll survive the people who condemn it. Because those people are no good.\\\",\\\"SM:That\\u2019s the nicest thing anyone\\u2019s ever said to me.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
