She handled it with unimaginable calm. But the way that she has been treated is just more evidence of the fact that our country has so much hatred toward successful women, and an inability to separate their accomplishments from that of powerful men.\\u201dShe added, \\u201cNothing gets me angrier than when someone implies that I\\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton because, frankly, because she\\u2019s a woman. Thank you. It\\u2019s not like we have some feminist version of beer goggles that is called estrogen blindness, which causes us to go walking towards the nearest vagina and vote for them. This assumption is condescending at best and is sharply misogynistic at worst.\\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 181392}"
