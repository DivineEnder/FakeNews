"{\"content\": \"The nation\\u2019s electoral board eliminated candidates Julio Guzm\\u00e1n and C\\u00e9sar Acu\\u00f1a from the presidential ballot for violations of Peru\\u2019s electoral law. Acu\\u00f1a allegedly participated in the \\u201cprohibited conduct of handing out money during a campaign event,\\u201d while Guzm\\u00e1n\\u2019s party, Todos por el Per\\u00fa (\\u201cEveryone for Peru\\u201d) stands accused of committing \\u201cgrave and irreparable\\u201d violations of its own nomination\\u00a0rules.Both are given the right to appeal the decision, and Guzm\\u00e1n has stated he has involved members of the Interamerican Commission of Human Rights to travel to Per\\u00fa and investigate the incident. A spokesman for Todos por el Per\\u00fa described the party as \\u201ctruly impacted\\u201d by the \\u201ctotally unjust\\u201d ruling, and Guzm\\u00e1n himself is calling for Fujimori to also be taken off the ballots, alleging that her party has made similar mistakes.\\u00a0\\u201cIf their cases are not treated with the same criteria, the current election and potential elected authorities will be illegitimate,\\u201d\\u00a0he said following the announcement of his removal from the ballot.Fujimori has remained mum regarding the elimination of her two greatest rivals, telling reporters\\u00a0that they can still appeal the decision and \\u201cwhat is important in any case is that we will live through a democratic process on April 10.\\u201d Only Alan Garc\\u00eda, former Peruvian president and currently the lowest-polling candidate in the race, has approved of the decision. \\u201cIt is based on justice for one fundamental reason: laws are written to be followed,\\u201d he said of the electoral board\\u2019s disqualifications.Guzm\\u00e1n was running second to Fujimori in the latest national polls with 18.3 percent to Fujimori\\u2019s 33.7 percent, the product of an extraordinary surge in the polls following months of polling in the single digits. Fujimori has been the frontrunner in the campaign for months; in January, she held 32 precent of the vote, with progressive candidate Acu\\u00f1a the only candidate to come close. At the time, Acu\\u00f1a was polling at 15.2 percent, with economist Pedro Pablo Kuczynski a distant third. Guzm\\u00e1n polled at 7.2 percent.A new poll conducted by the firm Datum following the announcement of the two campaigns\\u2019 annulments find Fujimori receiving 37 percent of the vote, while Kuczynski is in second place with 14 percent. While a significant boost for Fujimori that all but guarantees her the win, Peru\\u2019s presidential election rules demand that candidates go to second run-off election should no candidate receive 50 percent of the vote. The second election would feature only the top two candidates in the first round of voting.Fujimori has been a staple in Peruvian politics for decades. In addition to being a longtime Peruvian legislator, she served as First Lady of Peru in the 1990s at the behest of her father, President Alberto Fujimori, after her mother, Susana Higuchi, filed for divorce and ran a presidential campaign against her ex-husband. She was the runner-up in Peru\\u2019s 2011 elections, losing to left-wing candidate and current outgoing president Ollanta Humala.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 158179, \"title\": \"Peru Removes Two Top Candidates from Ballot, Leaving Field Open for Fujimori Heiress\"}"
