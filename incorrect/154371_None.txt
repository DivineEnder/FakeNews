"{\"title\": \"Lena Dunham Quits Twitter\", \"content\": \"In an interview on the Re/Code Decode podcast earlier this week, the Girls star revealed she quit the social media service over \\u201cverbal abuse\\u201d directed toward her by other users.\\u201cI don\\u2019t look at Twitter anymore. I tweet, but I do it through someone else,\\u201d Dunham told podcast host Kara Swisher, according to the Hollywood Reporter. \\u201cI really appreciate that anybody follows me at all, and so I didn\\u2019t want to cut off my relationship to it completely, but it really, truly, wasn\\u2019t a safe space for me.\\u201dIn explaining her decision to quit the service, Dunham cited \\u201cdisgusting\\u201d comments made on a particular photo she posted to her Instagram page last week: TBH this was a rough week. It felt like my body, my hormones, my general sense of well-being were betraying me. I wanted to crumple into a pile or hide like a sweatshirt in the lost and found. And I felt as though there wasn't a way to ask for the space and time I needed without hurting someone else. What a shitty feeling, but isn't that the reality for so many of us? I am certainly no self-help guru but here is what I know tonight: when you take the time and space you need, kindly and responsibly, you're suddenly available to the people you love in a whole new way. There is no other answer (except Calvins\\u2026 Nothing gets between us.)A photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Sep 16, 2015 at 9:31pm PDT\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t a graphic picture,\\u201d Dunham said. \\u201cI was wearing men\\u2019s boxers, and it turned into the most rabid, disgusting debate about women\\u2019s bodies, and my Instagram page was somehow the hub for misogynists for the afternoon.\\u201d\\u201cEven if you think, like, \\u2018Oh I can read, like, 10 mentions that say I should be stoned to death and kind of, like, laugh and move on,\\u2019 that\\u2019s verbal abuse. Those aren\\u2019t words that should be directed at you ever. And so, for me personally, it was safer to stop [using Twitter].\\u201dDunham also revealed that she has quit checking out\\u00a0left-leaning media outlets Gawker and Jezebel, likening reading the sites to \\u201cgoing back to a husband who beat me in the face.\\u201d\\u201cI used to read Gawker and Jezebel in college and be like, \\u2018I can\\u2019t wait to get to New York where my people will be to welcome me,'\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s like, it\\u2019s literally, if I read it, it\\u2019s like going back to a husband who beat me in the face \\u2013 it just doesn\\u2019t make any sense.\\u201dIn other news, Dunham told radio host Elvis Duran on Tuesday that HBO\\u2019s Girls will likely end after its upcoming sixth season.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 154371}"
