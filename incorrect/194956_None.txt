"{\"title\": \"Maliki, Iran, Saudis Point Fingers at One Another over Iraq's Sectarian Strife\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Maliki also announced he would be cracking down on politicians and military officers that he considered to be \\u201ctraitors.\\u201dMaliki pointed his finger directly at the Saudis, accusing them of financing jihadist group ISIS. An Iraqi government official told Reuters, \\u201cWe hold them responsible for supporting these groups financially and morally, and for the outcome of that \\u2013 which includes crimes that may qualify as genocide: the spilling of Iraqi blood, the destruction of Iraqi state institutions and historic and religious sites.\\u201dThe Saudi government also reportedly threatened the Iranians, telling the Shia Islamic Republic not to get involved in Iraq\\u2019s internal clashes. The Saudis also placed blame on Prime Minister Maliki, saying Iraq\\u2019s problems are largely due to years of \\u201csectarian and exclusionary policies\\u201d by the Shia-led government against Iraq\\u2019s Sunni population.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday that Iran will, if necessary, defend Iraq\\u2019s Shia Muslim population from \\u201ckillers and terrorists.\\u201d A report Tuesday said some 5,000 Iranians have pledged to respond to Rouhani\\u2019s call for defending Iraq\\u2019s Shia holy sites.Meanwhile, the Iraqi government has continued to largely shut down internet and social media platforms. What was once a ban in a few different provinces has now turned into a shutdown of private networks and mobile phone data. Some argue the media shutdown is occurring in an effort by the Iraqi government to shut down ISIS\\u2019s communication abilities. Many worry the jihadi group\\u2019s public diplomacy has enabled it to garner further support among Iraqis and the international community. The jihadist group has consistently broadcast images of mass executions and beheadings.In a surprising statement this week, a Turkish government representative told a Kurdish media station that Turkey accepts the Kurdish peoples\\u2019 right to sovereignty and self-determination. \\u201cThe Kurds of Iraq can decide for themselves the name and type of the entity they are living in,\\u201d said a ruling party spokesman. This marks a significant shift in policy priorities for the former Ottoman Empire headquarters. Although the Kurds have been largely autonomous since 1991, Turkey has since been opposed to their official recognition as a sovereign entity.\", \"article_id\": 194956}"
