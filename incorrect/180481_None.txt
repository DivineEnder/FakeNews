"{\"title\": \"Why Is the Media So Upset About Lovie Smith's Firing?\", \"content\": \"Here\\u2019s the truth: Smith was a decent coach. Not great. Not terrible. Decent. Smith will have no trouble getting a job elsewhere \\u2013 he\\u2019s got four other interviews lined up for today alone.But Smith lost his job for a reason. Smith was given a very expensive, very talented young quarterback, Jay Cutler, over the past two seasons; his offensive line leaked like a sieve, leading to Cutler\\u2019s repeated injuries. The Bears started 7-1 this season, then limped to a 10-6 record and missed the playoffs. This is the sort of stuff that coaches in the NFL routinely get fired over. This was a historically bad collapse. 52 teams have started 7-1 since 1990. Only one missed the playoffs. Until this year\\u2019s Bears team.Yet the media defenses of Smith are overwhelming. Today at Deadspin, Josh Levin called Smith\\u2019s firing \\u201cThe Black Monday Firing That Doesn\\u2019t Make Any Sense,\\u201d noting, \\u201cLovie Smith, then, was fired after leading a team to a record better than that of last year\\u2019s Super Bowl winner because a bunch of teams he didn\\u2019t coach happened to have good seasons. Also, he failed to prevent Jay Cutler from getting a concussion.\\u201d Doug Farrar at Yahoo! Sports writes, \\u201cThe move is questionable at best, in our opinion, and we\\u2019re not alone.\\u201dMost of these columnists point out that Smith went 81-63 with the Bears (winning percentage: .563). But few columnists have suggested that Andy Reid of the Eagles shouldn\\u2019t have been fired (he\\u2019s 130-93 over the last 14 years, a winning percentage of .583, and took the Eagles to the playoffs 9 times in that span); none have suggested that Norv Turner of the Charges be retained (56-40 over the last 6 seasons, a winning percentage of .583).Let\\u2019s assume these columnists are right, however \\u2013 assume the firing is questionable. Why the outrage?It could have something to do with Smith\\u2019s race. The media has a habit of going nuts every time a decent black head coach gets the axe (they don\\u2019t complain about Romeo Crennel, because it\\u2019s inarguable what a rotten coach he is; career record 28-55, winning percentage: .337).That habit has consequences. When Johnnie Cochran went insane over the firing of Tony Dungy from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2001 after Dungy went 9-7 as head coach, the league instituted the so-called Rooney Rule, requiring teams to interview at least one black candidate for every coaching position. The result has been an absurd system of token interviews and systemic oddities. Meanwhile, Dungy went on to have a successful career in Indianapolis \\u2013 before the Rooney Rule was instituted \\u2013 and the year after Dungy left Tampa Bay, Jon Gruden took over and led the Buccaneers to the Super Bowl. The model \\u201cracist\\u201d firing wasn\\u2019t racist. It was business, Sonny, not personal.The facts are these: Smith was fired for doing a mediocre job \\u2013 and this season, an almost unprecedentedly-awful job. It can\\u2019t be stated enough. He started 7-1; he finished 3-5. His team was not killed mid-season in a tragic fruit truck incident. Tom Coughlin is on the hot seat every year for similar numbers. The difference is that he wins a Super Bowl every so often. Lovie Smith\\u2019s teams win a playoff game every so often.But the media is playing the decision as though it\\u2019s utterly inconceivable. Hence these results of an ESPN poll from around the country: every state but Illinois thinks, by wide margins, that Smith should have been retained. As for Illinois \\u2013 where most Bears fans live \\u2013 they wanted Smith gone by a margin of 62-38.The hubbub over Smith has been deafening compared to the non-hubbub over Reid and Turner. The media outrage over the firing of Smith will likely intensify this week because of his race; after all, Michael Wilbon said last year, \\u201cDon\\u2019t spit in my face and tell me it\\u2019s raining. Progress will be when 65 percent of coaches are African-American, not\\u00a020 percent.\\u201d Don\\u2019t look for the media to stop playing the perpetual outrage game every time a decent black coach is fired. And the more often the media plays that game, the less likely that teams will consider good black candidates for head coaching positions, knowing that the media will blast them for firing them if they believe it is the right football decision.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 180481}"
