"{\"title\": \"Newsweek Recycling Tired Cover Illustrations\", \"content\": \"The August issue of Newsweek features the cover story \\u201c101 Best Places to Eat in the World,\\u201d and is illustrated with a close up of a pretty lady, head tilted back, and with asparagus spears dangling seductively toward her red, parted lips.If that seems familiar, you may have caught a 2008 cover of Observer Food Monthly in Great Britain that featured the exact same image. Not just a similar one, but the exact same stock photo.Or maybe you saw the same photo on a Harper\\u2019s Bazaar cover circa 2006?It appears the original photographer was one Donna Trope and the image can be seen on her website as the Harper\\u2019s Bazaar cover.Also, Eater.com notes that the whole sexy chick/asparagus theme is boringly common.The asparagus may have been fresh, but the Newsweek cover was as wilted as week-old produce. No wonder the Harmon family decided that even at $1 the magazine wasn\\u2019t worth the effort.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 121746}"
