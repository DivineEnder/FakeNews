"{\"article_id\": 265503, \"content\": \"Last week an Iberia Airliner left Havana, landed in Madrid and found an obviously desperate Cuban stowaway. The 23 year old Cuban man named Adonis G.B. was curled in the landing gear, crushed to death.  He joins an estimate of 50-70,000 Cubans dying (literally) to leave Fidel Castro and Che Guevara\\u2019s handiwork. Almost two million Cubans have made it out alive.On Christmas Eve, 2000, a British Airliner opened its landing gear near Heathrow airport after taking off from Havana and out dropped two corpses, frozen solid. They were shortly identified as 16 year-old Miguel Fonseca and 17 year-old Alberto V\\u00e1zquez.\\u201cCrazy blokes!\\u201d probably huffed some passengers, oblivious or uncaring that those Pounds they\\u2019d just spent on their Cuban vacation went straight into the coffers of the Stalinist police   who drove the Cuban boys to such desperation. Also oblivious or uncaring that prior to the reign of that Stalinist regime people were almost as desperate to enter Cuba as they are now to escape. Also oblivious that\\u2013despite what they hear, read and see from the worldwide media and Hollywood\\u2013tourism was actually a drop in pre-Castro Cuba\\u2019s economic bucket. Now\\u2013thanks to such as themselves\\u2013it\\u2019s the main lifeline, after Hugo Chavez. On June 4th 1969, an Iberia Airliner, just landed in Madrid from Havana, was taxiing to the terminal when the frozen corpse of 16 year old Jorge P\\u00e9rez dropped out. His partner in escape, Armando Socorras, 17, somehow survived in what Spanish medical authorities described as a form of \\u201chuman hibernation.\\u201d On July 21st 1991, the frozen corpses of Alexis Hern\\u00e1ndez 19, and Jos\\u00e9 Acevedo 20, plopped onto Madrid airport\\u2019s tarmac from the landing gear of another Iberia Airlines flight.On August 22, 1999, the frozen cadaver of Felix Julian Garcia dropped from a British airliner onto the tarmac of Gatwick airport, as it landed from Havana.\\nA month later, odor led officials of Italy\\u2019s Varese Airport to the decomposed corpse of Roberto Garc\\u00eda Quinta in the landing gear of an Alitalia Airlines flight that had landed from Santiago Cuba ten days earlier.In July 2002, the frozen and battered corpse of a of 20 year old Cuban identified only as Wildredo D. was found in the landing gear of a Lufthansa Airliner at Dusseldrof airport. In December 2002 a 20 year old Cuban who worked at Havana airport snuck into a pressurized compartment of Canadian Airliner, just under the cabin. He scurried out alive in Montreal airport 4 hours later.Pre-Castro Cuba took in more immigrants per-capita (primarily from Europe) than the U.S., including the Ellis Island years. In the 1950\\u2019s, when Cubans were perfectly free to emigrate with all their property and U.S. visas were issued to them for the asking, fewer Cubans lived in the U.S. than Americans lived in Cuba. In 1958 the Cuban Embassy in Rome had a backlog of 12,000 applications for immigrant visas from Italians clamoring to immigrate to Cuba. This flood of (fellow First World) \\u201cwetbacks\\u201d was so alarming that in 1933, as a stopgap against these foreign rascals horning in on the \\u201cCuban dream\\u201d, the Cuban government passed laws more draconian than Arizona and Georgia\\u2019s today: a majority of employees at all Cuban businesses had to be Cuban natives.Would our construction, service and hospitality industries survive (enforcement) of such a law nowadays?Such was Cuban prosperity till 1959. Then came the Castro brothers and Che Guevara.Adonis G.B\\u2019s throat was crushed and Spanish medical examiners said he probably died upon takeoff, meaning he probably died more quickly and painlessly than the tens of thousands of others who perished escaping Cuba\\u2019s free and fabulous healthcare.It was a different story for the tens of thousands of dead Cuban rafters.   Most of these desperate rafters probably died like captives of the Apaches, staked in the sun and dying slowly of sunburn and thirst. Others perished gasping and choking after their arms and legs finally gave out and they gulped that last lungful of seawater, much like the crew in The Perfect Storm. Still others were eaten alive \\u2014 drawn and quartered by the serrated teeth of Hammerheads and Tiger sharks much like Captain Quint in Jaws. Perhaps these last perished the most mercifully. As we\\u2019ve all seen on the Discovery Channel, sharks don\\u2019t dally at a meal.\\u201cIn space no one can hear you scream,\\u201d says the ad for the original Alien. Same for the middle of the Florida straits \\u2014 except, of course, for your raft-mates. While clinging to the disintegrating raft, while watching the fins rushing in and water frothing in white \\u2014 then red \\u2014 they hear the screams all too clearly. Elian Gonzalez might know.All during the decades coinciding with Castro\\u2019s rule, the Coast Guard has documented hundreds of such stories. Were the cause of these horrors more politically-correct we\\u2019d have no end of books, movies, documentaries, Oprah interviews, Survival-Story specials, etc.. We\\u2019d never hear the end of it. Alas, the agents of this Caribbean holocaust consist of the Left\\u2019s premier pin-up boys. Enough said.During the 70\\u2019s and 80\\u2019s, his Coast \\u201cGuard\\u2019s\\u201d machine-gun blasts kept disturbing Castro\\u2019s coastal subjects. So his military (kept fat and happy by tourism revenue) devised a remedy:   their Soviet helicopters kept hovering over the escaping freedom-seekers, but now\\u2013 rather than machine gunning them to death\\u2013they started dropping sandbags onto their rickety rafts and boats to demolish and sink them. Then the Tiger and Bull sharks did the Castroites\\u2019 deputy-work\\u2013noise free!Four years after the fall of the STASI-patrolled Berlin Wall, Castro\\u2019s STASI-trained police were gleefully machine-gunning Cubans who tried to swim into our Guantanamo Base, then retrieving their corpses with gaffing hooks. \\u201cThis is the most savage kind of behavior I\\u2019ve ever heard of,\\u201d said Robert Gelbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin America during the Clinton administration (no less!). \\u201cThis is even worse than what happened at the Berlin Wall!\\u201dSo what\\u2019s the alternative if you can\\u2019t flee Cuba? Well, in 1986, Cuba\\u2019s suicide rate reached twenty-four per thousand\\u2013making it double Latin America\\u2019s average, making it triple Cuba\\u2019s pre-Castro rate, making Cuban women the most suicidal in the world, and making suicide the primary cause of death for Cubans aged 15-48. At that point, the Cuban government ceased publishing the statistics on the self-slaughter.The figures became state secrets. The implications horrified even the Castroites.But apparently not the Democratic party\\u2019s Elder Statemen: \\u201cWe greeted each other as old friends\\u2026Fidel Castro is a committed egalitarian. He brought superb systems of health care and education to his people.\\u201d (Jimmy Carter)  \\u201cI frankly liked him\\u2026Everywhere we were surrounded by laughing children who obviously loved Fidel. Castro is very shy and sensitive a man I regard as a friend.\\u201d (George Mc Govern)The massacres and mass-suicides don\\u2019t faze the Democratic Party\\u2019s press auxiliaries either. \\u201cCastro\\u2019s personal magnetism is still powerful, his presence is still commanding. Cuba has very high literacy, and Castro has brought great health care to his country.\\u201d (Barbara Walters)\\u201cCastro is old-fashioned, courtly \\u2014 even paternal\\u2026a thoroughly fascinating figure!\\u201d (NBC\\u2019s Andrea Mitchell)\", \"title\": \"Desperately Fleeing Cuba's Free And Fabulous Healthcare\", \"source_id\": 2}"
