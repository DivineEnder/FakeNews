"{\"content\": \"{\\\"OKLAHOMA CITY \\u2014  It is one of the prime paradoxes of the 2016 election: A twice-divorced candidate who has flaunted his adultery, praised Planned Parenthood and admitted to never asking for God\\u2019s forgiveness is the favorite of the Christian right.\\\",\\\"The candidate,Donald J. Trump, who won with evangelical voters in South Carolina and has their support in other Bible Belt states that will vote in primaries on Tuesday, has dominated the Republican campaign by appealing to the economically disenfranchised. But the promise of a Trump presidency that would gall the political elites is also resonating with the culturally disenfranchised, including many conservative Christians.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump\\u2019s success with evangelicals, who constitute the largest Republican blocs in six Southern states voting on Tuesday, poses a mortal threat to SenatorTed Cruzof Texas, whose campaign is built on these voters. Mr. Cruz will face nearly insurmountable odds if he fails to carry more than his home state on Super Tuesday, with the race afterward moving to less favorable territory.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump\\u2019s appeal with the religious right is debunking some long-held maxims about evangelical voters, showing that they are not monolithic; that they do not fall neatly in step with evangelical leaders, many of whom endorsed Mr. Cruz; and that within evangelical ranks lie fault lines of class and culture.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSocial conservatives are taking a look at Trump and saying he\\u2019s not with me on all these issues, but the overall larger imperative for us is to tear down this system that has not served us for a very long time,\\u201d said Gregg Keller, a former executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which was founded by the Christian conservative Ralph Reed.\\\",\\\"In speeches, including one in Oklahoma City on Friday, Mr. Trump almost never talks about issues that politicians seeking evangelical support thunder about: abortion, religious liberty and, recently, the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice.\\\",\\\"Practically the only part of a Trump stump speech aimed at faith-driven voters is a promise that shopkeepers will again be able to say Merry Christmas. It is one of his most reliable applause lines.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump is winning with evangelicals, as he does with other Republican primary voters, by promising uncompromising immigration and trade policies and a hard-driving leadership style. \\u201cEvangelicals see all that\\u2019s going down, and they just like somebody to be strong and stern and consistent on issues,\\u201d said J. Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and onetime Baptist pastor, before Mr. Huckabee quit the race.\\\",\\\"A CBS News poll of Republican primary voters nationally this month showed Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz among evangelicals 33 percent to 22 percent.\\\",\\\"In South Carolina, where Mr. Trumpwon a commanding victory, earning all 50 delegates, he carried evangelicals by six percentage points over Mr. Cruz and 11 percentage points over Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, according to exit polls.\\\",\\\"After Mr. Cruz\\u2019s brutal South Carolina loss, his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, re-emphasized a Southern strategy, the cornerstone of Mr. Cruz\\u2019s campaign since he announced he was running. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to have a big night on March 1 in an electoral map that favors us,\\u201d Mr. Roe said.\\\",\\\"But even though Mr. Cruz won a plurality of evangelicals in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, he faces uncertain prospects in Oklahoma and other Bible Belt states that will vote on Tuesday. Polls show him trailing Mr. Trump in Oklahoma, Georgia and Alabama.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNot everybody is going to follow just because we say this is what we suggest you do,\\u201d said Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa who is a national co-chairman of the Cruz campaign.\\\",\\\"He expressed frustration that so-called values voters were giving Mr. Trump a pass on issues about his character, such as his mocking of women, as well as his conservative credentials. Mr. Vander Plaats suggested that they were \\u201ceither hypocritical or uninformed or maybe not interested.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not just three marriages,\\u201d he said, listing what he called Mr. Trump\\u2019s breaks from conservatism. They included donating to Democrats in the past and once suggesting that his sister, a federal judge whostruck downa ban on partial-birth abortions in New Jersey, could make a good Supreme Court justice.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI understand why you\\u2019re ticked off at your government,\\u201d Mr. Vander Plaats said of evangelicals who supported Mr. Trump. \\u201cBut if that\\u2019s your one rational reason for casting a vote, then I think you lack discernment, judgment and temperament.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The emergence of Christian conservatives as a force in Republican politics traces to the Moral Majority movement of the 1970s led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who helped put Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush into office. But the older generation has lost political clout, failing to see its favorites win the Republican nomination in recent presidential cycles, while the American mainstream has embracedsame-sex marriageand a more secular culture.\\\",\\\"Mr. Falwell\\u2019s son, Jerry Falwell Jr., now the president of Liberty University, where Mr. Trump called a book in the Bible \\u201cTwo Corinthians\\u201d instead of the more accepted \\u201cSecond Corinthians\\u201d in a speech, has endorsed the billionaire. He cited Mr. Trump\\u2019s business record and the strength he projects.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAll the social issues \\u2014 traditional family values, abortion \\u2014 are moot if ISIS blows up some of our cities or if the borders are not fortified,\\u201d he said, referring to the Islamic State. \\u201cRank-and-file evangelicals are smarter than many of the leaders. They are trying to save the country and maybe vote on social issues next time.\\u201d\\\",\\\"That sentiment is echoed by many grass-roots Trump supporters who identify as evangelical, though they may not be regular churchgoers.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou\\u2019re voting for a president; you\\u2019re not necessarily voting for a pastor,\\u201d said Less McNiff, a retired human resources executive who heard Mr. Trump address thousands at the Oklahoma City rally on Friday. \\u201cHe\\u2019s not necessarily orthodox, but I like the fact that he\\u2019s strong.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Linda Sharp, an elementary school music teacher from Moore, Okla., who attended the rally and plans to vote for Mr. Trump, said, \\u201cHe\\u2019s made moral choices that are not stellar, but I lay that against his business plan or the economic growth for America, and I choose that.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But her husband, Phillip Sharp, who is pastor of Heavenly Heights Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, cautioned those who would argue, like the younger Mr. Falwell, that voters should choose a strong leader rather than a pious one.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m sure the Nazis would have said the same thing,\\u201d said Mr. Sharp, who favored Mr. Cruz. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to be careful when somebody\\u2019s trying to make you great.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Some Trump supporters seem to wrestle aloud with the seeming contradiction between how their faith guides them and their hopes for a Trump presidency.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know that Trump is the person to bring God back into our country, but I think if we don\\u2019t we\\u2019ll have much bigger problems,\\u201d said Renae Ehler, an insurance saleswoman from Davenport, Okla., who planned to vote for Mr. Trump. \\u201cThe business part of things, I think, is going to make a big difference.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Paul Smith, a machinist in Oklahoma City, called himself a \\u201ctotal Christian\\u201d but said he did not attend a church because \\u201cI\\u2019ve witnessed too much hypocrisy\\u201d in churches. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been withDonald Trumpsince he put his hat in the race,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBasically he\\u2019s anti-establishment.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 344377, \"title\": \"Donald Trump, Despite Impieties, Wins Hearts of Evangelical Voters\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
