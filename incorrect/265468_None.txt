You can not dispel a mania by trying to prove to the maniacs that they can\\u2019t fly. Just ask the great Rabbis who were brought before the Papal Courts to debate theology \\u2013 and never lost.

It has excellent production values, a clear presentation of the facts and a sincere simplicity that holds your attention until the end. The problem is that it addresses two types of audiences: One that already knows and one that doesn\\u2019t care. Still, there\\u2019s probably nothing lost by Israel getting its message out \\u2013 as long as it continues to beef up the IDF.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 265468}"
