"{\"title\": \"Antibiotic misuse a threat to public\", \"content\": \"The Food and Drug Administration concluded in 1977 that feeding antibiotics daily to healthy livestock, chickens and hogs could promote antibiotic-resistant bacteria, capable of infecting people.Instead of addressing this growing public health threat, the FDA dragged its feet for more than three decades. But a federal judge ruled in March that the agency must finally take action. The court ordered the FDA to withdraw approval for the use in animal feed of two antibiotics important for human health.This decision \\u2014 in a case brought by consumer groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for Science in the Public Interest \\u2014 is a landmark victory in ending the misuse of antibiotics.If an animal is sick, by all means, it should be treated. But the evidence is overwhelming that the misuse of antibiotics in healthy animals reduces the drugs\\u2019 effectiveness in treating humans.Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can pass easily between humans and pigs, according to a recent study. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like watching the birth of a superbug,\\u201d said Lance Price, the study\\u2019s lead author.Pair that with the fact that 80 percent of all antibiotics sold in the U.S. are for use in food animals \\u2014 mostly to make them grow faster \\u2014 and you can see why Price and many other physicians and scientists are concerned.The development of antibiotics is one of modern medicine\\u2019s greatest achievements. It is a tragedy that we have come so far only to take these lifesaving drugs for granted.\\u201cThe world is heading toward a post-antibiotic era,\\u201d the director-general of the World Health Organization has warned, \\u201cin which many common infections will no longer have a cure and, once again, kill unabated.\\u201dMore than 70,000 Americans die each year from antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.Unfortunately, our food supply is fast joining hospitals as a breeding ground for these killer bacteria.A recent report found that nearly half of all U.S. retail meat and poultry is contaminated with the same antibiotic-resistant bacteria that plague hospitals. These bacteria can cause a variety of illnesses \\u2014 from skin infections to life-threatening diseases like pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome.In addition, resistant bacteria spewed from ventilation systems at rural animal production sites can infect the people living near these facilities, studies by the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future and others have revealed. Bacteria-laden animal waste can contaminate the groundwater, exposing people who draw their drinking water from shallow wells in the area. Bacteria in animal manure used to fertilize crops can also sicken consumers who eat contaminated produce.That\\u2019s why this court ruling against the FDA is a major public health victory. But the fight is not over. Without a timeline, the FDA and the drug industry can continue to delay action for months \\u2014 even years.So Congress must take action by passing new legislation that would ban the use of antibiotics critical for human health in animal feed \\u2014 while preserving the ability of veterinarians to treat sick animals.Congress owes it to the American people to save these precious drugs for the treatment of disease in future generations.Rep.
