The documents also included correspondence between Dr. Soon and the companies who funded his work in which he referred to his papers and testimony as \\u201cdeliverables.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In letters sent to seven universities on Tuesday, Representative Ra\\u00fal M. Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat who is the ranking member of the House committee on natural resources, sent detailed requests to the academic employers of scientists who had testified before Congress about climate change.\\\",\\\"The requests focused on funding sources for the scientists, including David Legates of the University of Delaware and Roger Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado at Boulder.\\\",\\\"In the letters, Representative Grijalva wrote, \\u201cMy colleagues and I cannot perform our duties if research or testimony provided to us is influenced by undisclosed financial relationships.\\u201d He asked for each university\\u2019s policies on financial disclosure and the amount and sources of outside funding for each scholar, \\u201ccommunications regarding the funding\\u201d and \\u201call drafts\\u201d of testimony.\\\",\\\"Three Democratic members of the Senate sent 100 letters to fossil fuel companies, trade groups and other organizations asking about their funding of climate research and advocacy. The letters were signed by Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, Barbara Boxer of California and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. The senators asked for responses by April 3.\\\",\\\"\\u201cCorporate special interests shouldn\\u2019t be able to secretly peddle the best junk science money can buy,\\u201d Senator Markey said, denouncing what he called \\u201cdenial-for-hire operations.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The funding disclosure questions concerning Dr. Soon have reverberated in other quarters as well. The Smithsonian Institution said on Sunday that it had handed its investigation of Dr. Soon\\u2019s dealings with funders and journals over to its inspector general. The Smithsonian\\u2019s acting secretary, Albert Horvath, announced that he would lead \\u201ca full review of Smithsonian ethics and disclosure policies governing the conduct of sponsored research to ensure they meet the highest standards.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The Smithsonian has already acknowledged one error in handling Dr. Soon.\\\",\\\"Charles R. Alcock, director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said last week that a contract provision with funders of Dr. Soon\\u2019s work that appeared to prohibit disclosure of funding sources \\u201cwas a mistake.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe will not permit similar wording in future grant agreements,\\u201d Dr. Alcock said in an email response to questions.\\\",\\\"Dr. Soon has taken a view, contrary to the vast majority of climate scientists, that variations in sunlight may account for much of the recent warming of the earth. The Smithsonian has long distanced itself from Dr. Soon, stating that it does not share his conclusions about climate change, but allowed him to continue working at the Center for Astrophysics, a joint operation with Harvard that is based in Cambridge, Mass.\\\",\\\"After news of the letters from Representative Grijalva was announced, Professor Pielke wrote on Twitter, \\u201cClimate McCarthyism alive &amp; well. Just learned a U.S. congressman has contacted my university to \\u2018investigate\\u2019 me.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Professor Pielke went on to note in the tweet that \\u201cI\\u2019m not even a skeptic\\u201d and that he supports the conclusions of the United Nations committee that reviews climate science, as well as the Obama administration\\u2019s proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations on greenhouse gases. He has, however, expressed frequent criticism of climate scientists.\\\",\\\"Professor Pielke also noted in a post on his blog that in 2010 hedenounced the effortsof Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, then the attorney general for Virginia, to investigate the emails and papers of the climate scientist Michael Mann.\\\",\\\"On his blog, Professor Pielke said that the pressure and \\u201csmears\\u201d had caused him to move away from climate research: \\u201cI am simply not initiating any new research or papers on the topic and I have ring-fenced my slowly diminishing blogging on the subject.\\u201d In an email response to questions, he said he had \\u201cunequivocably, never\\u201c taken money from the fossil fuel companies or allied organizations.\\\",\\\"Andrew Dessler, a mainstream climate researcher and a professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&amp;M University, said that he had concerns about \\u201cfishing expeditions\\u201d by Congress into researchers\\u2019 work, especially drafts of testimony requested in the letters from Representative Grijalva.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI like to apply the \\u2018what if it happened to me test,\\u2019 \\u201d he said. And while asking hard questions about funding is worthwhile, \\u201cwhen you start asking for these other documents, it\\u2019s more difficult.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In a statement, Representative Grijalva said that \\u201cI fully support academic freedom and open, spirited debate.\\u201d However, the news of Dr. Soon\\u2019s disclosure issues troubled him, he said, adding that he sent the letters \\u201cbecause of the harm done to public confidence in our scientific and legislative procedures.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He concluded, \\u201cCongressional disclosure requirements are not always strong enough to establish a witness\\u2019 full impartiality, and we need to fill in those gaps.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
