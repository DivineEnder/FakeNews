At tis point, the police turned against the protesters, withthe result of the worst violence in Pakistan\\u2019s 67 year history.It\\u2019s suspected, though not proven, that army chief Gen.

The army chief has publicly taken acentral role in the political crisis by offering to mediate, and thearmy chief is known to be furious at the prime minister for thelatter\\u2019s prosecution of former prime minister Pervez Musharraf forminister in 1999 by means of a coup that deposed and exiled thecurrent prime minister Nawaz Sharif.  After Musharaff stepped down,Sharif became prime minister again and imprisoned Musharaff, who isstill under house arrest.Saturday\\u2019s riots raise concerns that Nawaz Sharif will now be forcedto step down again, and the army will once again be in control ofPakistan\\u2019s government, in what would essentially be an army coup.BBC andDawn (Pakistan) and Guardian (London) and BBCUkraine \\u2013 thousands of Russian troops have crossed the border and appear poised for an attack on the port city of Mariupol.  It\\u2019s feared that Russian troops will join with troops already in Crimea, continue all the way to Odessa, and connect with separatist Moldovans in Transnistria in eastern MoldovaUkraine\\u2019s army is bracing itself for an assault by Russian forces onthe coastal port city of Mariupol.  Russian separatist forces inUkraine, bolstered by an invasion of thousands of Russian soldiersthat have crossed the border from Russia, are established abouthalfway between Mariupol and the Russian border.  Ukrainianforces are are reinforcing checkpoints and digging trenchesin anticipation of an attack.With thousands of Russian troops already taking part, European leadersare warning about an escalation.  Ukraine\\u2019s President Petro Poroshenkocalls it a \\u201cfull-scale invasion.\\u201dLithuania\\u2019s President Dalia Grybauskaite said, \\u201cRussia is at waragainst Ukraine and that is against a country which wants to be partof Europe. Russia is practically in war against Europe.\\u201d  EuropeanCommission President Jose Manuel Barroso says that the situation \\u201chasworsened considerably,\\u201d and added:\\u201cWe may see a situation where we reach the point of noreturn.  If the escalation of the conflict continues, this pointof no return can come.\\u201dHowever, Russia\\u2019s president Vladimir Putin appeared to be mocking andthreatening Europe with these comments on Friday when he said:\\u201cRussia is far from being involved in any large-scaleconflicts.  We don\\u2019t want that and don\\u2019t plan on it. Butnaturally, we should always be ready to repel any aggressiontowards Russia.Russia\\u2019s partners \\u2026 should understand it\\u2019s best not to mess withus.  Thank God, I think no one is thinking of unleashing alarge-scale conflict with Russia. I want to remind you that Russiais one of the leading nuclear powers.\\u201dPutin\\u2019s message is simple: Russian forces have already attacked andannexed Crimea, Russian forces are preparing to launch an attack onMariupol, and Russian forces will continue to whatever he wants themto do, and no one will stop them.Barroso\\u2019s comment about a \\u201cpoint of no return\\u201d is quite real.  Putinis crossing one red line after another, and keeps getting away withit.  But if he keeps doing that, then at some point he\\u2019s going triggerwhat in generational theory is called a \\u201cregeneracy,\\u201d a kind of panicthat causes the population to put politics aside and unite, usuallybehind a military leader.  A financial panic is similar.  The panic istriggered because of a sudden fear that the society or its way of lifeis facing an existential threat that must be conquered.This kind of panic could not have happened during the 1980s or 1990s,because survivors of World War II were still running the world, andwhen survivors of the previous generational crisis war are still incharge, then the society is resilient to this panic.  But as the WW IIsurvivors disappear, the society becomes less resilient, and the rightkind of event can trigger a panic and a war.  That will be the \\u201cpointof no return\\u201d that Barroso is referring to.I used to think that it would be China or the Mideast that wouldtrigger the next world war.  But as Putin crosses one red line afteranother in Ukraine and Syria as the world goes deeper into agenerational Crisis era, it may well be that Putin is the one thathistory will blame for starting World War III.
