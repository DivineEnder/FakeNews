"{\"title\": \"Blind as a Bat? Blown Call Gives Seahawks Another Sketchy MNF Victory\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Down 13-10 with less than two minutes to play, the Detroit Lions again proved their knack for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Calvin Johnson, on a play that tied him with Herman Moore as the franchise\\u2019s receptions leader, tried to stretch a catch into a touchdown catch. An opportunistic Kam Chancellor (pay the man) stripped the ball from Megatron inches from the goal line. Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright, rather than pounce on the ball for a touchback in the endzone, batted it past the back line.The NFL rulebook, specifically rule 12, section 4, frowns on such behavior:\\u00a0Lions fans objected. NFL VP of Officiating Dean Blandino objected. Twitter objected.I called it!!! You can\\u2019t intentionally bat the ball out of the endzone !!! Seahawks get away with cheating again!!\\u2014 NickBarnett (@NickBarnett) October 6, 2015\\nDoug Baldwin tried to shake the ref\\u2019s hand. Back Judge not having it. #Seahawks\\u2014 Danny O\\u2019Neil (@dannyoneil) October 6, 2015\\nFor Seattle fans to argue that the call wasn\\u2019t the story of the game is laughable. It also doesn\\u2019t matter if fans or players knew the rule. \\u2014 Rob Guerrera (@StatsOnFire) October 6, 2015\\nHow can an entire NFL referee crew blow a call that decides a Monday Night Football game??? Such a bad look for the league.\\u2014 Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) October 6, 2015\\nKJ Wright\\u2026 \\u201cWas Generally aware\\u201d tht he was intentionally batting the ball\\u2026 Where is Ted Wells & his crew?! #BatGate #Seahawks #lions \\u2014 Rosevelt Colvin (@rcolvin3) October 6, 2015\\nI PROMISE YOU BILL BELICHECK KNOWS THAT RULE\\u2026CAUSE WE PRACTICED IT IN OUR SITUATIONAL PRACTICES\\u2026 #wedabest #chesswhileyouplaycheckers\\u2014 Rosevelt Colvin (@rcolvin3) October 6, 2015\\nEither NONE of the officials knew the rule, or the back judge somehow missed the intentional bat. Hmmm\\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6YItdac3tu\\u2014 Rob Guerrera (@StatsOnFire) October 6, 2015The league can\\u2019t blame replacement referees this time for the reparations call for Super Bowl XL. A back judge appeared in perfect position to make the call. His popularity might have plummeted in Seattle. But the NFL provides security for such unpleasantries.The NFL does not review penalties. So, the Seahawks gain possession of a ball they never recovered (Seattle secures turnover if the ball bounced out of the endzone unaided), Russell Wilson makes good this time on a gutsy pass call when the situation screams run, and time expires on the hopes of the Detroit Lions in the game and perhaps the season.\\u201cOf all sad words of tongue or pen,\\u201d Lions fans say with John Greenleaf Whittier today, \\u201cthe saddest are these, \\u2018It might have been.\\u201d\", \"article_id\": 159861}"
