"{\"title\": \"Oil Price Up Over 50% Since February Low\", \"content\": \"Since the price for U.S. crude oil, called West Texas Intermediate (WTI), hit a 12-year low on February 11 at $26.11 a barrel, the market has rallied by over 50 percent to an intraday high of $41.90.The March 22 recovery high came amidst the horrific Brussels terrorist attack and an 8.8-million-barrel rise in U.S. crude oil inventories, the 2nd biggest weekly build in a year, according to the American Petroleum Institute.The driving force in the oil market has been speculation about an imminent supply freeze led\\u00a0by Saudi Arabia and Russia, after months of diplomatic talks. Although the two countries tentatively\\u00a0struck an agreement last month to withhold further production, both have continued to increase supply.Lower prices were expected to devastate the U.S. fracking boom, which saw American production almost double to 9.3 million barrels a day. But despite the up to 75 percent decline in the WTI price and a 41 percent drop in the number of operating drilling rigs, from 1,809 to 1,069, U.S. production is virtually unchanged in the last year.This baffling phenomenon is due to U.S. fracking producers, which now accounts for over 50 percent of U.S. production, shocking commodity markets with their ability to cut costs and improve production at wells already in operation, according to the Drilling Productivity Report.America\\u2019s oil production since 2008 is up 80 percent, mainly due to ever-increasing efficiency. As a result, the United States overtook surpassedRussia last year\\u00a0as the world\\u2019s\\u00a0largest and fastest-growing\\u00a0producer of oil and natural gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.Despite this year\\u2019s global spending in the oil sector falling 27 percent compared to last year, and 44 percent below 2014 levels, America\\u2019s improved fracking efficiency has more than made up for the price cut.To get a sense of the future economics of fracking in the U.S., it was estimated in late 2015 by analysts at Jeffries & Co. that there is a backlog of 5,000 wells that are \\u201cDrilled, but UnCompleted\\u201d (DUC), waiting to be fracked.EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) stated that they intended to bring about 270 DUC wells into production in 2016. At a current crude oil price of $41 a barrel, EOG estimates that with fracking they can make a 30 percent profit. That means their break-even is $28.70 a barrel, just slightly above the February market low of $26.11.More importantly, EOG can make an even bigger profit by selling future deliveries of crude oil barrels in the commodity markets for about $43 in July, $45 in December, and $47 in December 2015.President Obama once stated that U.S. oil was in terminal decline:\\u201cOil is a finite resource\\u2026 We consume more than 20 percent of the world\\u2019s oil, but have less than 2 percent of the world\\u2019s oil reserves.\\u201d\\u00a0He added, \\u201cFor decades, we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered. For decades, we\\u2019ve talked and talked about the need to end America\\u2019s century-long addiction to fossil fuels. And for decades, we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires.\\u201dDuring Obama\\u2019s time in office, the American fracking boom has cut the price of oil by 60 percent \\u2014 and U.S. net imports of oil by nearly 60 percent. And te 50 percent bounce in the price of oil over the last six weeks appears to have set the stage for the sequel of the U.S. fracking boom\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 295840}"
