"{\"title\": \"When Muslims Make Fun of the Amish\", \"content\": \"So last night on the show, Andy Levy pointed out that the person representing the Ground Zero mosque on Twitter made a few jabs at the Amish.\\n\\nThis is what the Tweeter tweeted:\\n\\nLater, that tweet was deleted.Which is a shame, because it didn\\u2019t have to go. See, the Mosque folks don\\u2019t understand that here in America you can make fun of any religion \\u2013 yes, even the Amish \\u2013 and angry followers won\\u2019t throw acid in your face or behead you in front of a tripod. And, as primitive as the Amish are, they won\\u2019t even stone you to death for adultery. But the tweeting Park51 can be forgiven: maybe they thought the Amish might head out from Lancaster County and fly a buggy straight into their building. Don\\u2019t worry, \\u201cParky:\\u201d they wouldn\\u2019t get the horses through the Lincoln Tunnel.Anyhoo, that\\u2019s my point. We all make Amish jokes, because we can. They are nice people. The worst thing they ever did was deal meth \\u2013 and in parts of rural PA, that\\u2019s almost considered a civic duty (I kid the rural PA-ers).Meanwhile, after I made my proposal to open a gay Muslim bar next to the mosque \\u2013 I was warned by friends, coworkers and deli managers that I\\u2019d end up dead. Who knew so many people hated the Pet Shop Boys?But it is certainly rich for the folks behind the mosque to poke fun of a religion for eschewing modern convenience. After all, the Amish are beyond advanced when compared to the most ardent followers of Islam. Remember, the Amish do not demand that the world to return to a period when its prophet lived \\u2013 a time when more people died during childbirth than from old age.But hey \\u2013 at least these Mosque-eteers at Park51 can make fun of the Amish.Maybe later, they can make fun of themselves.And if you disagree with me, you\\u2019re a racist homophobe who stole my pants.Tonight:Bill Hemmer!Juliet Huddy!Stephen Kruiser!\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 190873}"
