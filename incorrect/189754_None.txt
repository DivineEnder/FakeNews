"{\"title\": \"Reader Poll: Why is Aaron Sorkin Obsessed With Hating Sarah Palin?\", \"content\": \"Aaron Sorkin is up for an Academy Award this year for his \\u201cSocial Network\\u201d script, a film many on the left have criticized for its demeaning portrayal of women. Here at Big Hollywood, we\\u2019ve also documented at length Sorkin\\u2019s raging obsession with Sarah Palin, a dark anger with a life all its own that likely goes well beyond partisanship and says something about Sorkin himself. After all, he never criticized the former governor based on any kind of substance, never says here\\u2019s where she\\u2019s wrong on this issue or that \\u2014 which would be perfectly fine. Instead, we\\u2019re aways treated to this nasty but revealing streak of name calling and personal attacks. What drives this? What drives a man who has everything to demean women in such a public way,  both onscreen and off?Well, we\\u2019re not psychiatrists and coming to any kind of conclusion regarding whatever Sorkin\\u2019s troubling personal issues are would only be speculation. So we thought, why not ask you? When the American people chime in, they usually get it right, so please do take our poll and help us to understand where this bizarre behavior might come from.Take the poll below the fold:// \\n<BR/> stLight.options({ publisher:'18355ba4-a04c-4a33-a76f-847aadfc0f80', onhover:false });\\n<BR/>// \\n\\n| Feedback Tab\\nView MicroPoll\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 189754}"
