"{\"title\": \"Russian Launches New UK Channel to Combat Western 'Propaganda' While Cracking Down on Critical Media at Home\", \"content\": \"Russia has opened a television channel in Britain and launched a foreign news service called Sputnik as it pulls out all the stops to promote its \\u201calternative\\u201d voice abroad, while at home it cracks down on opposition media.At the lavish launch of Sputnik last week, its chief Dmitry Kiselyov, who has famously said Russia was the only country capable of turning the United States into \\u201cradioactive ash\\u201d, said the new service aims to fight \\u201caggressive propaganda that is now being fed to the world\\u201d.One of the first articles posted on the site sets the tone, saying: \\u201cNATO has repeatedly accused Moscow of its involvement in the Ukrainian crisis, including allegations that Russia has sent tanks and troops to the conflict zone. This week, Sputnik published an article on the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev where he is quoted as calling US President Barack Obama a \\u201clame duck\\u201d. Another article is headlined: \\u201cNATO Prefers to Ignore Russian Efforts to Stabilize Situation in Ukraine.\\u201d\\u2013 \\u2018Instrument of propaganda\\u2019 \\u2013Observers have already dismissed Sputnik as a tool of Russian propaganda.Sputnik is not Russia\\u2019s first such media venture. In 2005, it launched RT television channel, which broadcasts in English, Arabic and Spanish and was initially called Russia Today. A French version is in the works.After moving into studios in Washington in 2010, the channel last month launched a new channel in Britain, RT UK, specifically aimed at British viewers.The new channel has already prompted controversy, with the British media regulator Ofcom ruling this month that it \\u201cfailed to preserve due impartiality\\u201d in covering the events in war-torn Ukraine.Simonyan has stressed that RT is an \\u201calternative\\u201d voice, saying it acts as a counterbalance to major Western media.\\u2013 Controlling popular media \\u2013While Kremlin-controlled media outlets are expanding, life is getting ever tougher for the few independent media left in Russia.A programme seen as Russia\\u2019s last independent political show on mainstream television \\u2014 Ren TV\\u2019s weekly analytical show hosted by one of the country\\u2019s best known anchors, Marianna Maximovskaya \\u2014 has been taken off the air this past summer.Before that the chief editor of one of Russia\\u2019s most popular news websites, Lenta.ru, was summarily dismissed over its Ukraine coverage.Russian lawmakers have also hurried through a restrictive law limiting foreign ownership of any media outlet to 20 percent. The law is seen as a huge blow to business daily Vedomosti, which publishes editorials that are openly critical of Kremlin policies and is jointly owned by Finnish media group Sanoma Independent Media, Dow Jones and the FT Group.This month US television channel CNN announced that it would suspend broadcasting in Russia from the end of 2014.Now the future of one of the last media outlets to criticise the Kremlin, the Echo of Moscow radio station, is hanging in the balance.Once a symbol of new-found freedoms under Boris Yeltsin, the radio station has widely been seen as a safety valve giving liberal Russians an opportunity to vent their frustration with authorities.Veteran editor-in-chief Alexei Venediktov has been under huge pressure after he got involved in a public dispute with the station\\u2019s main owner, Gazprom Media holding, which is controlled by state energy giant Gazprom.The conflict arose after Venediktov refused to sack a journalist on the orders of Gazprom Media after he posted a controversial message on Twitter about the death of the son of Putin\\u2019s chief-of-staff Sergei Ivanov.The station had earlier run into trouble with a programme featuring the same journalist that reported from the frontline on the Ukrainian troops fighting pro-Russian rebels at Donetsk airport.The state watchdog accused Echo of Moscow of putting out \\u201cinformation that justifies war crimes\\u201d.The Kremlin, said Morozov, wants to \\u201creinforce control over popular media and to force the journalists to live in an atmosphere of self-censorship and fear of persecution.\\u201d \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 185504}"
