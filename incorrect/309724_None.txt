"{\"title\": \"Bette Midler Apologizes for 'Transphobic' Bruce Jenner Tweets\", \"content\": \"The mini-controversy began Saturday when Midler tweeted two jokes about Jenner, the former gold medal Olympian who transitioned into a woman last year and landed a reality television series.\\u201cNow that @IAmCait has been cancelled, will she go back to being Bruce?\\u201d the 70-year-old singer wrote in a since-deleted tweet, referring to Jenner\\u2019s now-cancelled E! series I Am Cait.She followed up with another since-deleted post: \\u201cWill Kris take him back? Do I smell a re-wedding?!\\u201dSensitive Twitter users were quick to brand Midler\\u2019s tweets \\u201ctransphobic\\u201d and \\u201cpathetic.\\u201d@BetteMidler This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to be transgender. Really disappointing.\\u2014 Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) August 21, 2016.@BetteMidler @IAmCait Just shows, you can be as gay-friendly all you want, but to some, transphobia comes so easy. How tired and pathetic.\\u2014 Annie Wallace (@anniewallace) August 21, 2016.@BetteMidler @HRC it's never OK to refer to a trans person's name and pronoun prior to their transition, even when referring to their past\\u2014 maraleia (@maraleia) August 21, 2016I hope @BetteMidler apologizes for her terrible transphobic comments and takes the time to educate herself on trans people's rights/dignity\\u2014 Her Majesty (@RoyalHoeliness) August 21, 2016Midler apologized on Sunday, addressing her tweet to the LGBT advocacy organization Human Rights Campaign.\\u201cDear friends @HRC, whom I have always supported,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cSorry last tweet offended. An idle musing. I seem to have misread the temper of the times.\\u201dDEAR FRIENDS @HRC,  WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED. SORRY LAST TWEET OFFENDED. AN IDLE MUSING. I SEEM TO HAVE MISREAD THE TEMPER OF THE TIMES.\\u2014 Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) August 21, 2016Ironically, though perhaps unknown to her younger fans, Midler became a gay icon in the 1970s, when she frequently performed alongside Barry Manilow at the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in the basement of the Ansonia Hotel in New York.The singer performed there so frequently and was so beloved in the then-underground LGBT community that she earned the nickname \\u201cBathhouse Betty,\\u201d which later became the title of her ninth studio album.Midler is the second star to apologize for social media musings this week. Pop star and The Voice coach Blake Shelton offered up a mea culpa after fans charged that tweets the singer wrote several years ago were homophobic and racist.\\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 309724}"
