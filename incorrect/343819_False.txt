At 7 p.m. here on Monday, Republican and Democratic caucuses will be called to order in 1,681 precincts around the state. It\\u2019s an arcane relic of neighbor-to-neighbor politics, but also an example of democracy at its grass-roots finest. This final Our Man in Iowa dispatch answers frequently asked questions onthe Iowa caucuses.\\\",\\\"(Join us for live coverage of theIowa caucuses.)\\\",\\\"(I alsotook questions on Reddit.)\\\",\\\"We will be reportingIowa resultshere. The Democratic and Republican parties of Iowa are promising returns in almost-real time on their respective websites:www.iagopcaucuses.comandwww.idpcaucuses.com.\\\",\\\"The stateRepublican Partysays the first returns will be in around 7:30 p.m., and it promises to have results \\u201cfully reported back in just a few hours.\\u201d The Democratic results could take longer because Democrats caucus differently.\\\",\\\"Republicans declare their candidate preferences by a show of hands or by writing out a secret ballot. The Democratic process is complicated: Groups of supporters for each candidate (or undecided attendees) sit or stand together in \\u201cpreference groups.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A head count of everyone in the room is conducted. If any candidate (or the undecideds) don\\u2019t have enough supporters \\u2014 in most cases, 15 percent of the caucusgoers \\u2014 the group is ruled \\u201cnonviable.\\u201d Its members realign with other groups, and a final count is made.\\\",\\\"It\\u2019s a disputatious party, what can I say. The fun comes when supporters of candidates try to persuade people in nonviable groups or undecideds to join their team. There are chants, debates about policy and electability, or maybe just the offer of a beer later on. As the state party puts it: \\u201cThere is a lot of debating and moving around. It is democracy in action.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Yes. Before voting, a supporter for each candidate can make a two-minute speech to all the caucusgoers. Anyone can speak for a candidate. That includes 11-year-old Allisyn Shelley, who will speak for Donald J. Trump in one Davenport precinct. Some candidates will even visit caucuses to speak for themselves \\u2014 because Iowans may not have fully memorized every stump speech.\\\",\\\"The parties and some campaigns have made videos to demystify a process that can be intimidating and has kept turnout abysmally low considering the number of eligible voters. Seethis oneby theDemocratic Partyof Iowa,this oneby Ivanka Trump on behalf of her father, andthis oneby members of Bernie Sanders\\u2019s Iowa field staff.\\\",\\\"Only registered voters who enroll as Republicans or Democrats. Voters can register for the first time at the caucus site or switch their affiliation.\\\",\\\"It\\u2019s possible, if a wave of unregistered or unaffiliated supporters show up, especially for the two candidates drawing a lot of support from caucus newcomers, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders. Caucusgoers sign in on arrival and register at that time. Anyone not in line by 7 p.m. Central cannot participate.\\\",\\\"From as few as a dozen in some rural precincts to several hundred. John Tone, the chairman of Republican precinct 62 in Des Moines, is expecting more than 300 at his middle school caucus site, and the Democrats from precinct 62, who are also meeting at the school, expect more than 600.\\\",\\\"Only for the Republicans, who report the total vote counts for each candidate. The Democrats are electing delegates to county conventions, who in turn choose delegates to a state convention.\\\",\\\"The statewide winner on caucus night will be the candidate earning the most \\u201cstate delegate equivalents,\\u201d which is reported as a percentage. That\\u2019s what you\\u2019ll see on the returns page for the Democratic Party.\\\",\\\"Of course not. It\\u2019s a tiny state, in terms of population. Democrats are electing 44 out of 4,763 delegates to their convention in Philadelphia. The Republicans are choosing 30 out of 2,472 delegates to their national convention in Cleveland.\\\",\\\"You have a choice of how to interpret that: The caucuses are much ado about very little. Or, because these are the first votes cast, there is a lot at stake in terms of popular momentum, news media attention and donor love.\\\",\\\"Feel free to spend the evening with \\u201cAntiques Roadshow.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
