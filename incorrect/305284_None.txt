New reports show that veterans in the country and in Texas are still victims of these practices.It has been a year since President Obama attended a veterans roundtable at a Phoenix VA medical facility where he said he had veterans\\u2019 \\u201cbacks.\\u201d His visit came after scandalous reports were made public about VA wait times and scheduling report manipulations. His promises made to veterans can be found at this link to a March 13, 2015 White House press release. The President\\u2019s statements include references to \\u201ccooking the books\\u201d and an \\u201cunwillingness to face up to the fact that veterans were not being adequately served went on too long, and as a consequence, we didn\\u2019t fix what needed to be fixed.\\u201d He correctly noted that there was a \\u201cneed to restore trust and confidence in the VA system.\\u201dOn March 16, 2015, the White House issued an announcement\\u00a0saying \\u201cPresident Obama traveled to Phoenix, AZ to visit the Phoenix VA medical facility and to participate in a roundtable discussion with the Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald, Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson, and veterans to hear about the progress we\\u2019ve made to improve the VA\\u2019s ability to serve our veterans.\\u201dThis March 2015 White House announcement states, \\u201cWhile in Phoenix, the President announced the launch of an advisory committee: The MyVA Advisory Committee will advise the VA on additional ways the VA can work to improve customer service delivery and veterans\\u2019 outcomes. President Obama also charged the new committee with assessing what progress has already been made at the VA to improve veterans\\u2019 access to quality medical care.\\u201dOn March 8, 2016, the Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General released twelve reports on VA Health Care Systems in Texas. Seven of these revealed scheduling mismanagement that led to extended veteran wait times. Overall, they show that improper scheduling and scheduling data manipulation is ingrained throughout the VA Texas Health Care System. The reports also concluded that lack of supervision, poor training of employees, and non-centralized scheduling, are primary causes of data manipulation.In May 2014, Breitbart News reported that a whistleblower behind the federal investigation of a Veterans Affairs clinic in Fort Collins said she was put on unpaid leave for two weeks for not \\u201ccooking the books\\u201d when scheduling the appointments of veterans. The former Navy reservist who was back on active duty said she refused to hide wait times of the appointment dates requested and the actual dates, a process called \\u201cZeroing Out.\\u201d She was suspended after she filed an internal grievance about the transfer and scheduling practices. She was offered her pay back if she would no longer publicly talk about the problems at the VA.Breitbart Texas reported on May 30, 2014, that a VA\\u00a0whistleblower was claiming that the VA hospital system in Texas is an \\u201corganized crime syndicate.\\u201d It appeared that VA administrators in Texas were attempting to cover-up policies that have allegedly created fake waiting lists to ensure that the administrators receive bonuses.In June 2014,\\u00a0President Obama accepted the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki and named Deputy Secretary Sloan D. Gibson as acting Secretary. As reported by Breitbart Texas\\u2019 Bob Price, \\u201cThe rare display of accountability le[ft] veterans and citizens across America wondering what is next for our wounded and otherwise injured veterans who are caught up in the bureaucratic delays and possible criminal behavior of some VA administrators.\\u201dOn June 24, 2014, Breitbart News reported that\\u00a0CNN\\u2019s Drew Griffin, the reporter who uncovered the VA scandal, interviewed another whistleblower. The scheduling clerk at the Veterans Administration office in Phoenix said the deaths of veterans were still being covered up by changing lists of veterans who have died to make it appear that they were still alive. CNN had\\u00a0reported that more\\u00a0than 1,000 veterans may have died in the last decade because of malpractice or lack of care.In September 2015, Breitbart News reported that the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report revealing that about 307,000 sick veterans died while waiting for care. The report actually found that many of the veterans on the waiting list had been dead for over four years. \\u201cThe report confirms the worst-case scenarios about the long VA wait times that have made news reports and sparked questions in Congress since last year,\\u201d the Breitbart article noted. Reports also revealed that \\u201cthe [VA] enrollment program did not effectively define, collect, and manage enrollment data.\\u201dThe Breitbart News report chronicled that the study \\u201coccurred after whistleblowers warned of the utter mismanagement at the Veteran Affairs offices that included incorrectly making unprocessed applications and the deletion of thousands of records over at least the last five years.\\u201d The OIG study also revealed that waiting lists included one veteran that had died in 1988 and another had been on the waiting list for fourteen years.On Thursday, Texas John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and Governor Greg Abbott,\\u00a0sent a letter (attached below) to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald urging him to address problems that are still pervasive at the VA.These Texas leaders also asked the VA Secretary to use the authority granted by Congress \\u201cto remove any individual from the VA Senior Executive Service whose poor performance or misconduct warrants such removal.\\u201d\\u201cWe remain troubled that the VA continues to fail to provide timely health care to our nation\\u2019s veterans, despite receiving enhanced authorities and funding from Congress to hire new employees and address additional problems facing the VA,\\u201d they wrote. \\u201cOur veterans have fulfilled their solemn duty to the nation, and the VA has an obligation to provide them with timely, high-quality health care.\\u201dLast year, Sens. Cornyn and Cruz successfully passed an amendment to the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2016. It requires the VA Secretary to provide federal lawmakers with a plan to address the long wait times for veterans seeking care at the South Texas Veterans Health Care System.In February of this year, the VA Inspector General found 51 scheduling red flags at 73 other veterans medical facilities, as reported by USA Today. The following includes a list of 111 VA facilities flagged for wait-time investigation.During his State of the Union speech in January of 2014, President Obama promised veterans that he would stop the backlog. He said, \\u201cNo one knows this better than those who serve in uniform. As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life. We\\u2019ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they\\u2019ve earned, and our wounded warriors receive the health care \\u2013 including the mental health care \\u2013 that they need.\\u201dBreitbart News\\u2019 John Hayward wrote after Obama\\u2019s State of the Union speech, that while he asserted \\u201calready, we\\u2019ve made strides\\u201d to improve the lives of those who have served this country in the military, \\u201cIn reality, of course, the Veterans\\u2019 Affairs Department nightmare evolved into a massive crisis while Barack Obama was asleep at the wheel, his empty rhetoric from 2008 about reforming the VA\\u00a0long forgotten.\\u201dLana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
