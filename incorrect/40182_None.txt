"{\"article_id\": 40182, \"title\": \"Dems' week of living confidently\", \"content\": \"This is what Democrats hoped it would feel like to be back on the right side of history.Over the last week, four foundational aspirations of the modern Democratic Party converged in four days of unexpected triumph.The Supreme Court struck down a law barring federal recognition of same-sex marriages. President Barack Obama announced aggressive new emissions regulations to fight climate change. The Senate passed a dramatic immigration reform plan with a supermajority vote. And a Texas legislator\\u2019s filibuster over abortion access turned into a national media sensation, energizing the left.In every instance, Democrats feel they carried the day on an issue essential to the progressive identity \\u2013 equal rights for gay couples, protecting the environment from global warming, tolerance of immigrants in general and Latinos in particular, and forceful commitment to women\\u2019s abortion rights.( PHOTOS: Wendy Davis\\u2019s filibuster)Also in every instance, top Democrats \\u2013 including a sitting president \\u2013 rallied around a stance that would until recently have been considered politically perilous. A decade ago, it would have been unthinkable for a national party to stake its future on solidly liberal positions on all four of those issues. Even Obama himself didn\\u2019t run on such a platform in 2008.To political observers outside the Democratic ranks, this week\\u2019s exultation might look like a case study in hubris: a party led by a president with middling approval ratings, heading into a challenging midterm election framed by a still uncertain economy, shackling itself to an agenda that\\u2019s plainly to the center-left of many Senate and congressional battlegrounds.Democratic and progressive leaders shrug at such thinking. In their view, that\\u2019s missing a much larger point with bigger and longer-range implications: that the country as a whole has changed, demographically and generationally, to such an extent that their value set is embraced by a national political majority.( POLITICO Junkies: Obama faces tough political environment on climate change)Their victory lap this week, they say, is less a matter of ostentatious overconfidence, than a recognition that despite the party\\u2019s present frustrations in a gridlocked Washington, there is a political world elsewhere that is inexorably moving in a liberal direction.\\u201cEvery day, we had significant progress on issues that are at the core of the progressive task,\\u201d said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress. \\u201cMy own view is that we are seeing the fruition of the changing demographics and the rising coalition that is changing the way the country thinks.\\u201dAFL-CIO president Richard Trumka likened the current political moment to the 1930s and \\u201840s, when a half-century\\u2019s worth of immigration and social change \\u2013 coupled with a global depression that discredited Republican economic policies \\u2013 triggered a huge progressive ascendancy.( Also on POLITICO: Is the Senate really working?)\\u201cThe solutions that we have are supported by a vast, vast, vast majority of the American public,\\u201d Trumka said. \\u201cOnce leaders started to understand that by standing for those principles and aggressively pursuing them, that that\\u2019s a winning combination, then I think we started making progress.\\u201dThe primary obstacle holding Democrats back now, Trumka said, is merely electoral mechanics \\u2013 the disproportionate power of conservative states in the Senate and a creatively drawn congressional map.Follow @politico\", \"source_id\": 1}"
