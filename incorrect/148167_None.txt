"{\"article_id\": 148167, \"title\": \"Blue State Blues: It Kills Me, but Bill Maher Is Our Only Hope\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Maher is set to address graduates of the University of California at Berkeley\\u00a0during the winter commencement exercises this Saturday, and is determined to do so, despite threats of protests by Muslim students who are offended by his strident criticisms of Islam.In his speech, Maher has a unique opportunity to stand up for free speech\\u2013not just on Berkeley\\u2019s campus, but in America itself, where freedom of expression has had a terrible week.Consider the events of the past few days.Last Wednesday, students and community activists protesting against police shut down a speech at the Berkeley Forum by gay libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel. They burst\\u00a0through the doors of\\u00a0Wheeler Hall, where the university had just observed the 50th anniversary of the Free Speech Movement, and stormed the stage. Thiel\\u2013who likely agrees with many of the protestors\\u2019\\u00a0political views\\u2013was forced to flee from the ignorant, brutish horde.This Wednesday, Sony canceled the release of\\u00a0The Interview, a comedy targeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. It did so after hackers released the private emails of Sony executives and threatened a 9/11-style terror attack if the movie was ever screened. Not even an A-list liberal celebrity like Oscar winner George Clooney could muster any support for the studio and for freedom of expression in general once Sony CEO Amy Pascal\\u2019s private racial jokes about President Barack Obama leaked.The same day, President Obama signed a deal with the Cuban dictatorship that not only traded convicted Cuban spies for a U.S. hostage, but also offered the Castro regime normalized relations in exchange for virtually nothing. In his speech to the American people explaining the sudden shift in U.S. policy, Obama all but gave up on the idea of democratic change in one of the worst\\u00a0dictatorships on earth, blaming the U.S. embargo, not the Castros\\u2019\\u00a0repression, for Cubans\\u2019 lack of access to media.Maher\\u2019s political incorrectness has never been more urgently needed.Though Maher has insisted he wants the focus of his Berkeley appearance to be the graduating students themselves, and sources have indicated to Breitbart News that he is not likely to raise the issue of Islam in his address, he could\\u2013and should\\u2013make some very important points about the value of free expression, on a campus where the administration seems more committed to that freedom than many of the students.One important lesson Maher can impart in this \\u201cteachable moment\\u201d is that freedom of speech is there to protect views you\\u00a0don\\u2019t\\u00a0like.Maher himself is a case in point. Personally, I\\u00a0dislike most of what he says and does. He is infamously vulgar about conservatives, and\\u00a0violated\\u00a0his purported libertarian principles to support the statist policies of the Obama administration. Worst of all, he has used political correctness to attack others\\u2013such as Andrew Breitbart, whom he falsely accused of racism.But free expression needs an anti-hero\\u2013not the likes of\\u00a0Steven Colbert, who was f\\u00eated Thursday for his nine-year career of lampooning Republicans, the safest target in human civilization.And presumably, even an war critic\\u00a0like Maher understands that free speech is a right for which generations of Americans have fought and died. It is worth fighting for still, not least because the new threat comes from a communist tyranny\\u00a0in an era that has forgotten\\u00a0why we\\u00a0resisted\\u00a0communism at all.In a year that has seen\\u00a0more commencement speakers \\u201cdisinvited\\u201d from campuses across the nation than ever before, when Hollywood liberals who routinely congratulate each other on their bravery fled in fear from their own computers, Berkeley\\u2019s administration deserves credit for sticking with Maher.Now Maher has a chance\\u00a0to say\\u00a0what Berkeley, and the nation,\\u00a0needs to hear:\\u00a0that we didn\\u2019t fight a Revolution so that a tyrant could tell us what not to watch, or a mob tell us what not to think.\"}"
