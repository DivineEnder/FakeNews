"{\"article_id\": 338227, \"title\": \"Chirlane McCray, in Evolving Role and in Song, Finds Her Voice  \", \"content\": \"{\\\"Inside City Hall in October, some three dozen commissioners and administration officials gathered to discuss children\\u2019s issues, rattling off statistics on cognitive development in toddlers.\\\",\\\"The group, called the \\u201cchildren\\u2019s cabinet\\u201d byMayor Bill de Blasio, was formed in April, but had, on this day, attracted a first-time visitor: his wife, Chirlane McCray.\\\",\\\"And Ms. McCray had a request: Would anyone mind, she asked, if she sang a song?\\\",\\\"Hearing no objections, New York City\\u2019s first lady began a lullaby she had used with her own family, turning to serenade a deputy mayor who had discussed the importance of singing to children.\\\",\\\"The meeting, according to several people there, continued after a round of applause. But administration aides, taken with Ms. McCray\\u2019s impromptu performance, resolved to add to her audience: A recording of her lullaby will soon be featured in a promotion about early childhood development.\\\",\\\"Since long before Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s election, the mayor and his wife have fashioned themselves as a package deal, blurring the personal and political in campaign ads, hiring decisions, policy discussions at home and news conferences, in which podium kisses have been common.\\\",\\\"The mayor, a Democrat, assigned his wife a staff, named herchairwoman of the city\\u2019s nonprofit armand has referred to her time and again as his \\u201cmost important adviser\\u201d \\u2014 a position both unpaid and undefined.\\\",\\\"There have been bumps.\\\",\\\"Public polls suggested a limited appetite for Ms. McCray\\u2019s wide-ranging duties. She became an unwitting bit player in scandals real and imagined: an uproar over antipolice messages from the son and the boyfriend of herchief of staff(who eventually stepped aside), and questions about whether Ms. McCray wore jeans to the funeral of a police officer (she did not).\\\",\\\"Now, 15 months into her husband\\u2019s tenure, Ms. McCray\\u2019s role has evolved. Dozens of conversations with aides, friends and administration officials suggest she is far less involved in the day-to-day operation of the city than many people had initially expected, instead hewing closely \\u2014 particularly in recent months \\u2014 to issues that she relates to personally.\\\",\\\"She ishelping overseea review of mental health problems that affect New Yorkers in an effort to address disparities in care \\u2014 a campaign prompted, in part, by her daughter\\u2019s struggles with depression and addiction. And Ms. McCray remains a public face of the city\\u2019s focus on education, turning her attention now to the travails, and tunes, of early childhood.\\\",\\\"At the same time, she remains a uniquely influential voice in the mayor\\u2019s political orbit, enjoying uncommon access to the levers of government but also casting about for how to best spend her time.\\\",\\\"The result has been a hybrid of the municipal-cum-marital partnership the mayor seemed to propose \\u2014 the city\\u2019s answer to the Clinton family \\u2014 and the long-established rituals of political marriages, at which the de Blasios have chafed.\\\",\\\"Ms. McCray has interviewed applicants for top administration jobs and wrapped Christmas presents for the cameras with the Duchess of Cambridge, cajoled lawmakers to support her husband\\u2019s prekindergarten program and tended to the family\\u2019smove to Gracie Mansion.\\\",\\\"Maria Laurino, a longtime friend and the wife of the first deputy mayor,Anthony E. Shorris, recalled predicting before Mr. de Blasio took office that Ms. McCray would have \\u201cmore of aMichelle Obamarole \\u2014 and I say that as a huge fan of Michelle Obama.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cTo me,\\u201d she added, \\u201cthat\\u2019s kind of what it\\u2019s been.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. McCray, 60, has researched the contours of her position, with a sense of history and the instincts of a former speechwriter and poet. She maintains a blog,#FLONYC, modeled afterEleanor Roosevelt\\u2019s newspaper column, \\u201cMy Day.\\u201d She has spoken to Mrs. Obama andHillary Rodham Clintonabout how to approach life as a first lady, and met privately at a Brooklyn restaurant with the last woman to assume the title in New York City,Donna Hanover, the former wife ofRudolph W. Giuliani.\\\",\\\"Ms. McCray, who declined to be interviewed in person, has grown into the role at a deliberate pace. Her emphasis on mental health and young children has allowed her more expansive ownership over certain initiatives for the first time.\\\",\\\"She studies topics as if preparing for a final exam, poring over stacks of policy reports and meeting with mental health experts from Canada and Sweden. In February, she met with two mental health experts in San Francisco while visiting her daughter, Chiara, at college.\\\",\\\"\\u201cShe\\u2019s been doing her homework,\\u201d Gary Belkin, the executive deputy commissioner for mental hygiene, said.\\\",\\\"Other challenges have abounded. The nonprofit that Ms. McCray leads, theMayor\\u2019s Fund to Advance New York City, can no longer subsist on the business contacts and check-swapping of former MayorMichael R. Bloomberg.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIn New York, fund-raising tends to be, \\u2018You give to my cause, I give to your cause,\\u2019\\u00a0\\u201d said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of thePartnership for New York City, a coalition of business leaders. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a real disadvantage to try to raise money in New York when you\\u2019re not rich.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The fund raised about $19 million in the first year under Ms. McCray, a steep drop from the roughly $105 million it took in during the final full fiscal year of the Bloomberg administration. De Blasio administration officials said the new figure was consistent with fund-raising early in Mr. Bloomberg\\u2019s tenure, and noted that the final annual total under Mr. Bloomberg was especially high because of donations tied toHurricane Sandy.\\\",\\\"This month, Ms. McCray hosted a gathering of well-heeled potential donors, making introductions in City Hall\\u2019s stately Blue Room. Afterward, she was met with a curious inquiry from an out-of-town attendee: How long had Ms. McCray worked for the city?\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe had not a clue who she was,\\u201d Ms. Wylde said. She interjected on the first lady\\u2019s behalf: \\u201cThis,\\u201d Ms. Wylde told the man, \\u201cis Mrs. de Blasio.\\u201d\\\",\\\"At times, Ms. McCray can appear ill at ease as a public speaker, leaning on a one-word question \\u2014 \\u201cRight?\\u201d \\u2014 to goad a crowd to cheers. Alerts about her upcoming appearances end with a familiar refrain: \\u201cThere will be no Q. and A.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. de Blasio, 53, has remained her most zealous champion. He has chastised reporters, without Ms. McCray present, for misrepresenting her and has often implored audiences to applaud her work.\\\",\\\"Asked once about the Quinnipiac poll that foundlittle supportfor his wife\\u2019s extensive duties, Mr. de Blasio offered a critique of \\u201cmodern polling\\u201d in general.\\\",\\\"In a New York magazine article last year, staff members referred to Ms. McCray as \\u201cthe mayor\\u2019s Mophie,\\u201d after the battery pack case that covers an iPhone completely, restoring its charge.\\\",\\\"The administration has not hesitated to repeat that message. When a photographer captured a backstage kiss between husband and wife before Mr. de Blasio\\u2019sState of the Cityaddress last month, the mayor\\u2019s office posted the image on Twitter six times in three days.\\\",\\\"Friends and officials describe Ms. McCray as the administration\\u2019s compass. She helps guide and clarify her husband\\u2019s thinking, they say, and balances the demands of a working parent, with a daughter in college and a son in high school.\\\",\\\"Aides to the mayor are keenly aware that Ms. McCray remains central to his appeal among many supporters, long after an election campaign in which the multicultural de Blasio family also starred.\\\",\\\"At the time, her presence as the black wife of a white candidate made her a powerful surrogate amid discussions ofstop-and-friskpolicing and other racially charged issues during the campaign. Her biography received intense media attention after it was revealed that she had long identified as a lesbian before meeting Mr. de Blasio.\\\",\\\"Though Mr. de Blasio has said he and Ms. McCray worry about their son\\u2019s interactions with the police as a black teenager, she has not. But since the election, Ms. McCray has not shied away from discussions of race and identity. After Apple announced that it was diversifying the hues of emojis, Ms. McCray cheered the move on her Facebook page.\\\",\\\"\\u201cRepresentation matters,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cTip for the next round? Two words: Natural hair.\\u201d\\\",\\\"And at an event this month celebrating a friend, the author Barbara Smith, Ms. McCray read an excerpt froma decades-old poem, in which the first lady called herself \\u201ca nappy-headed, no-haired, fat-lipped, big-bottomed Black girl.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Soon, New Yorkers will hear some of her gentler work: The lullaby she sang to her children \\u2014 and, on one occasion, her husband\\u2019s deputy mayor for strategic initiatives.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou could just see the whole room change,\\u201d the deputy mayor, Richard Buery, recalled, adding that the data-minded attendees were reminded of \\u201cthe potential to create magical moments for children.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In January, Ms. McCray reprised the performance for its coming release, reinserting her daughter\\u2019s name:\\\",\\\"My name is Mommy and what is yours?\\\",\\\"I want to know who are you?\\\",\\\"Chiara! Chiara! That\\u2019s a nice name\\\",\\\"And that\\u2019s the way we play our game.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
