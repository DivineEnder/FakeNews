"{\"article_id\": 244122, \"title\": \"Witness Thought Pistorius 'Was Going to Hurt Himself' After Shooting Girlfriend\", \"content\": \"\\u201c\\u2018I shot her. I thought she was a burglar. I shot her,'\\u201d radiologist Johan Stipp recalled Pistorius saying in the minutes after the fatal shooting for which the celebrated athlete is on trial for murder.A few minutes later, Stipp said, Pistorius went upstairs \\u2014 the area where he had shot Reeva Steenkamp \\u2014 and then returned. At that point, Stipp said he was concerned that the gun used in the shooting had not been recovered and that a distraught Pistorius was going to harm himself. The testimony did not address what Pistorius did when he went upstairs.The testimony in a Pretoria court was the first detailed, public description of the immediate aftermath of the shooting of Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, by the Olympian in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 14 \\u2014 Valentine\\u2019s Day \\u2014 last year.At his bail hearing last year, Pistorius said in a statement read by lawyer Barry Roux that, after he realized he had shot Steenkamp, he pulled on his prosthetic legs and tried to kick down the toilet door before finally giving up and bashing it in with a cricket bat. Inside, he said he found Steenkamp, slumped over but still alive. He said he lifted her bloodied body and carried her downstairs to seek medical help.\\u201cIt was obvious that she was mortally wounded,\\u201d Stipp said as he described what he saw at Pistorius\\u2019 villa. \\u201cAt the bottom of the stairs \\u2026 there was a lady lying on her back on the floor.\\u201dAs a radiologist, Stipp is a medical doctor with years of study, and he said he used his expertise to try to save the shot woman.\\u201cI tried to assist her.\\u201d Stipp said. \\u201cI tried to open an airway.\\u201d\\u201cShe had no pulse in the neck, she had no peripheral pulse. She had no breathing movements that she made,\\u201d Stipp said.Sitting on a courtroom bench, Pistorius bent forward and put his hand over his face, then moved them to cover both ears, as Stipp spoke. He stayed that way for a while, even when one of his lawyers reached back and touched him on the head.\\u201cI went near her and as I bent down, I also noticed a man on the left kneeling by her side,\\u201d Stipp said under questioning by prosecutor Gerrie Nel. \\u201cHe had his left hand on her right groin, and his right hand, the second and third fingers in her mouth.\\u201dStipp, who said he didn\\u2019t know that man was Pistorius until later, said he tried to help but Steenkamp showed no signs of life. Stipp said he noticed a wound in her right thigh, in her upper arm and in the right side of the head, and there was brain tissue around the skull.Pistorius is charged with murder after shooting Steenkamp three times out of four shots through a toilet door in his home. Prosecutors said the athlete intentionally killed Steenkamp after an argument, but Pistorius says it was a mistake because he thought she was an intruder.\\u201cOscar was crying all the time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe was praying to God, \\u2018Please let her live.'\\u201d\\u201cOscar said he would dedicate \\u201chis life and her life to God\\u201d if she would live, according to Stipp.Pistorius, who ran at the 2012 Olympics on carbon fiber blades that brought him to be known as the Blade Runner, is charged with premeditated murder. The state has to prove its case against Pistorius completely to convict, while his defense can focus on casting doubt.Pistorius\\u2019 lead defense lawyer, Roux, mainly avoided the gruesome details of Steenkamp\\u2019s injuries, saying he did not want to be \\u201cgraphic.\\u201dThe head shot was \\u201cterrible, serious, devastating,\\u201d Roux said as he began his cross-examination of Stipp, a prosecution witness.However, three witnesses, including Stipp, have now testified to hearing a woman screaming in Pistorius\\u2019 home, apparently boosting the case against Pistorius that there was a fight between the couple and Pistorius killed Steenkamp intentionally.\\u201cI\\u2019m convinced that I heard a lady\\u2019s voice,\\u201d Charl Johnson, another neighbor, said earlier Thursday.Stipp also said he believed a woman was screaming in Pistorius\\u2019 home that night, which Pistorius\\u2019 team says did not happen.\\u201cI heard the woman screaming. I tried to ascertain \\u2026 where it was coming from,\\u201d Stipp said at the start of his testimony.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
