Been on the bill for many, many years and really represented somebody that was very important to this country.\\u201dIt should be noted that under the proposed Treasury redesign, Jackson will still be on the back of the bill, which would give Jackson fans a fifty-fifty chance of seeing him each time they pluck a twenty from their wallets.\\u201cThe backs of the $5 and $10 bills also will be redesigned over time to tell the story of civil rights for women and African-Americans, a marked departure from the current lineup of presidents and founding fathers\\u2014unchanged since 1928,\\u201d the\\u00a0Wall Street Journal\\u00a0reported.\\u201cI think Harriet Tubman\\u00a0is fantastic,\\u201d Trump continued. \\u00a0\\u201cI would love to leave Andrew Jackson and see if we can maybe come up with another denomination. Maybe we do the $2 or we do another bill.\\u201dFormer presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson, now a supporter of Donald Trump, expressed similar sentiments in a Fox Business interview.\\u201cWell, I think Andrew Jackson was a tremendous secretary \\u2014 I mean a tremendous president,\\u201d said Carson. \\u00a0\\u201cAndrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt.\\u201d\\u201cI love Harriet Tubman,\\u201d Carson continued. \\u00a0\\u201cI love what she did, but we can find another way to honor her. Maybe a $2 bill.\\u201dFox News host Greta van Susteren said the Obama Administration was acting \\u201cstupid for no reason\\u201d by changing the $20, although, like Trump, she spoke well of Harriet Tubman.\\u201cYou all know I\\u2019m a feminist, love to see women acknowledged for the great things they do to contribute to our nation, and Harriet Tubman did, and she deserves it,\\u201d said Van Susteren.She was convinced the change on the twenty would \\u201cdivide\\u201d and \\u201cstir up the country,\\u201d and suggested a better idea would be to create a new $25 bill with Tubman\\u2019s portrait on it.\\u201cThat\\u2019s the smart and easy thing to do. But no, some people don\\u2019t think [so] and would gratuitously stir up conflict in the nation. That is so awful, and yes, dumb,\\u201d van Susteren declared.A remarkable amount of resistance to the Tubman Twenty comes from people on the left. \\u00a0Rapper Azealia Banks was apoplectic about what she saw as an attempt to \\u201cpatronize\\u201d Tubman.\\u201cDon\\u2019t fall for the s**t,\\u201d Banks railed on Twitter. \\u00a0\\u201cIt\\u2019s patronizing, and a Nobel black woman like Harriet would be deeply offended were she still Alive.\\u201d\\u201cSo, they\\u2019re gonna put Harriet Tubman on the 20$ bill as another little trinket to keep blacks satisfied,\\u201d Banks fumed in another Tweet. \\u00a0\\u201cBut won\\u2019t repay us for slavery.\\u201dWriting at the PowerLine blog, Steven Hayward noticed some left-wingers furious that Tubman was being appropriated as a symbol of capitalism, by putting her on the currency.\\u201cBy escaping slavery and helping many others do the same, Tubman became historic for essentially stealing \\u2018property,'\\u201d thundered one such screed. \\u00a0\\u201cHer legacy is rooted in resisting the foundation of American capitalism. \\u00a0Tubman didn\\u2019t respect America\\u2019s economic system, so making her a symbol of it would be insulting.\\u201d\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to see Tubman commodified with a price, as she once was as a slave,\\u201d ran another such objection. \\u00a0\\u201cI don\\u2019t need to see hers as the face of the US treasury, being passed in transactions to underpaid retail workers and appearing in print ads for transnational banks.\\u201dThere might be more reactions from the public, pro and con, once more of them figure out who Harriet Tubman is. \\u00a0\\u201cWho is Harriet Tubman?\\u201d became the top searched question on Google after the Treasury announcement was made.There might also be more objections from the left, if they come to see the Tubman Twenty as humorist David Burge (aka Iowahawk) does:Breaking: Treasury throws founder of the Democratic Party off $20 bill, replaces with gun-toting Republican pic.twitter.com/G9dVXpTaXv\\u2014 David Burge (@iowahawkblog) April 20, 2016\", \"source_id\": 2}"
