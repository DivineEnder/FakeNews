"{\"title\": \"Guess What? Islamic Countries Most Dangerous for Christians\", \"content\": \"Despite communist North Korea topping the list for the ninth consecutive year, the most dangerous countries in which to practice Christianity are overwhelmingly Islamic ones, according to the annual Open Doors World  Watch List.Of the top 10 countries on the 2011 WWL, eight have  Islamic majorities and persecution of Christians has increased in seven of them. They are:\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nOf the top 30 countries on the list, only seven  have a source other than Islamic extremists as the main persecutors of  Christians.The top 10 in order are North Korea, Iran,  Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Maldives, Yemen, Iraq, Uzbekistan  and Laos, which has a Communist government. Iraq is new to the top 10  list while Mauritania dropped out, going from No. 8 to No. 13.The  annual World Watch List is compiled by the research department of Open  Doors International. It tracks the shifting conditions under which  Christians live in 77 societies and then ranks the top 50 where it is  hardest to practice the Christian faith.\\u201cBeing a Muslim Background Believer or \\u2018Secret  Believer\\u2019 in a Muslim-dominated country puts a bulls-eye on the backs of  Christians,\\u201d said Dr. Carl Moeller, president and CEO of Open Doors USA. \\u201cThere  is either no freedom to believe or little freedom of religion. And as  the 2011 World Watch List reflects, the persecution of Christians in  these Muslim countries continues to increase.The country with the  largest Christian community on the list is Pakistan with more  than 5 million believers.  One of those is Asia Noreen who was sentenced to death on a false blasphemy charge, Moeller said.Pakistani Christians also faced a sharp  erosion of their religious liberty with the country leaping from No. 14  to No. 11 on the current list, according to the news release announcing the 2011 list. Twenty-nine Christians were martyred in  the reporting period with at least one killing occurring every month.  Four Christians were sentenced to long terms in jail for blasphemy  against Islam, at least 58 Christians were kidnapped, more than 100  Christians were assaulted and 14 churches and properties were damaged.Other  countries that rose markedly on the new WWL were Afghanistan, up from  No. 6 to No. 3, especially in the wake of ugly demonstrations when  footage of Muslims being baptized was shown on network television.  Dozens of Christians from the tiny Afghan church have had to move due to  subsequent death threats, and in August a 10-person medical aid team  from a Christian organization was slaughtered.The year\\u2019s  grisliest headlines were found in No. 26 Nigeria, however, where a  staggering 2,000 Christians lost their lives in riots caused by Muslim  extremists in some of the northern states in the country. Tension has  been growing for more than a generation in northern Nigeria, and  escalated after 1999 when 12 northern states adopted Sharia (strict  Islamic law). On Christmas Eve Compass Direct News reported the killing  of a Baptist pastor and five other Christians in northern Nigeria. More  killings of Christians were also reported in the last two weeks.Egypt  is ranked No. 19 on the WWL and could be a focus of persecution this  year as 21 Christians were killed in a bomb blast on New Year\\u2019s Day  outside the Church of Two Saints in Alexandria.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 267450}"
