"{\"title\": \"Goats Employed to Clear Unwanted Homeless Campers from San Rafael\", \"content\": \"The owner of the property and real estate tycoon Fred Grange says that the grass and brush grow very high and provide a clandestine temporary living area for many homeless people. \\u201cYou and I can\\u2019t even see the bottom of it. It\\u2019s pretty easy to hide. So, unless someone\\u2019s out patrolling, you\\u2019re not gonna see who\\u2019s out there,\\u201d added San Rafael Fire Department Battalion Chief Jeff Rowan.Unfortunately, carelessness has precipitated some fires on the undeveloped land and is a potential safety hazard for the inhabitants, as well as those who live nearby. According to CBS, environmental issues have prevented the fire department from using heavy equipment to trim back the brush and high grass.The Fire Department decided to use goats to mow the grass and eliminate the hiding places to discourage homeless people from camping out on the property. All day long, the goats chomp away at what seemed to be an impenetrable wall. CBS reported that the goats will eat just about anything, including thick grass, thorny vines, and the trash. Happily, the project is working great and within two days, the goats have put a substantial dent in the overgrowth.\\u201cWe\\u2019ve come up with the goat eradication plan,\\u201d property owner Fred Grange said.On top of that, the goats have become a tourist attraction for adults and children. \\u201cThey are very curious creatures. I\\u2019ve worked with sheep, I\\u2019ve worked with cattle, and what I realized is that with goats they are much more personable,\\u201d claims\\u00a0Sandra G. Solaiman, Affiliate Professor of Animal Nutrition at Auburn University. \\u201cThey can be pets, they are curious. That\\u2019s why they get into everything.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 247836}"
