"{\"title\": \"How #GamerGate Shattered Gawker's Myth of Invincibility\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Gawker mercilessly destroyed the careers of its targets, many of whom, such as Justine Sacco and Pax Dickinson, were guilty of nothing more than off-colour jokes on social media. They were the shamers-in-chief of the internet: all the more frightening because the sins they punished were so\\u00a0ubiquitous and mundane. Former Gawkerite Adam Weinstein portrays\\u00a0this period as a kind of golden age for the blogging network.The world has changed rapidly.\\u00a0Public shaming is no longer cool; \\u00a0John Ronson resoundingly won the argument against it with his new book,\\u00a0despite vain attempts of activists to (you guessed it!)\\u00a0publicly shame him.\\u00a0Attempts to portray Ronson as hostile\\u00a0to the\\u201dhistorically powerless\\u201d\\u00a0fell flat, as\\u00a0commentators eagerly embraced a mainstream author willing to speak out against the new mob mentality.Gawker Media, which relied so heavily on the practice to grant itself the veneer of righteousness, has now become one of the most derided publications on earth. Their botched attempt to out Conde Naste executive David Geithner as gay caused outrage\\u00a0across the media and political landscape. Meanwhile, their long history of violating celebrities\\u2019 privacy is swiftly\\u00a0catching up to them in the form of \\u00a0Hulk Hogan\\u2019s $100m lawsuit, filed against Gawker for the release of a sex tape involving the wrestler.Throughout history, great empires, states, political movements and institutions\\u00a0have all fallen victim to the myth of invincibility. From the\\u00a0Romans at the Battle of Teutoburg\\u00a0to the British Empire in the Boer war, the destruction\\u00a0of these myths is\\u00a0all the more painful due to the triumphs that preceded them. Few would call Gawker invincible today. Its reputation is on the rocks, as the company plans to relaunch itself later today. The Geithner story has proved to be disastrous for the company, triggering a string of editorial resignations\\u00a0in addition to the storm of external condemnation.But the story doesn\\u2019t strike me as a case of imperial myth-shattering. In the major\\u00a0historical examples\\u00a0\\u2013 the Boers, the Vietcong, the Germanic tribesmen \\u2013 great powers were humiliated at the very height of their glory by poorly-equipped, underdog\\u00a0opponents who should have been walkovers. The Geithner story, where Gawker had to fight the entire media establishment by itself, doesn\\u2019t fit this pattern at all. So what does?Gawker vs GamergateView post on imgur.comWhen a few thousand gamers\\u00a0started to draw attention to poor standards in video games journalism last September, no one predicted it would grow into a year-long movement that spanned the globe. Nor\\u00a0did anyone predict the damage it would do to Gawker Media. Gamers had no track record as campaigners or great organisers, nor as social media activists. When #GamerGate emerged, it was a bolt from the blue, and some predicted it would be over in a week.But gamers were determined. They had a laundry list of complaints against the gaming press,\\u00a0and they had Gawker in their sights from the beginning. The name of Gamergate\\u2019s hub on Reddit \\u2013 \\u201c/r/KotakuInAction\\u201d \\u2013 is revealing. (Kotaku, for those of you who don\\u2019t know, is Gawker\\u2019s video games vertical.)\\u00a0The near-ruination of game developer Brad Wardell by\\u00a0Kotaku\\u2019s poor reporting, a steady stream of outrage-mongering on the topics of race and gender, and\\u00a0perceived conflicts of interest on the part of Kotaku writers meant many gamers had gone sour on the site by the start of Gamergate. One supporter of the hashtag\\u00a0described Kotaku as \\u201cyellow journalism and tabloid gossip brewed into a foul, brain-killing mess.\\u201dTwitter in 2014 was the land\\u00a0of #YesAllWomen and #CancelColbert, a haven of politically correct outrage. The emergence of a\\u00a0culturally libertarian, anti-censorship, anti-narrative hashtag like Gamergate was unexpected, to say the least. Progressive journalists in the games and tech press reacted with instant hostility and released a string of articles branding gamers as\\u00a0reactionary, sexist \\u201chyper-consumers.\\u201d As Slate\\u2018s David Auerbach argued at the time, games journalists had essentially declared war on their own audience.Gamers used the attacks to their advantage, sending a deluge of complaints to companies that advertised with their antagonizers. Gawker, with its long history of unethical\\u00a0reporting, was particularly vulnerable to this strategy and lost its first sponsor just days after Gamergate began its campaign. They had already locked themselves in a losing battle \\u2014 but their Quinctilius\\u00a0Varus had yet to enter\\u00a0the field. That came later.Ultimately #GamerGate is reaffirming what we\\u2019ve known to be true for decades: nerds should be constantly shamed and degraded into submission\\u2014 Sam Biddle (@samfbiddle) October 16, 2014Bring Back Bullying\\u2014 Sam Biddle (@samfbiddle) October 16, 2014If there is one feature that\\u00a0unites the imperial downfalls of history, it is the moment of hubris. The moment at which an opponent\\u2019s strength is wildly underestimated, or one\\u2019s own is wildly overestimated.In October 2014, Gawker writer Sam Biddle did both. He no doubt intended\\u00a0to do to Gamergate what he had done to Justine Sacco \\u2014 publicly shame them, or \\u201cdegrade them into submission,\\u201d as he put it. But his tweets \\u2014 posted, disastrously, during national bullying awareness month \\u2014 caused\\u00a0a PR calamity that would lead to one of Gawker\\u2019s most visible\\u00a0humiliations. The\\u00a0shamers were about to be shamed.Yesterday I tweeted some things about \\\"nerds\\\" that were supposed to be funny, but ended up hurting many ppl. I fucked it up, and I'm sorry!\\u2014 Sam Biddle (@samfbiddle) October 17, 2014Gamergate\\u2019s\\u00a0boycott campaign pivoted, focusing\\u00a0all of its firepower on Gawker Media\\u2019s advertisers and sponsors. Within a\\u00a0day, Biddle had taken to Twitter to issue a public apology \\u2014 an act\\u00a0that would become a feature of Gawker in the months to come. Editorial director Joel Johnson reiterated his apology\\u00a0on the front page of Gawker \\u2014 another sign of the future.\\u00a0Johnson also sent a memo to Gawker\\u2019s writers warning them to watch their words on social media. A publication whose writers were famed for their recklessness was beginning to show signs of caution.Even Gawker couldn\\u2019t hide the extent of their defeat. Editor-in-Chief Max Read summed up his feelings in a headline: \\u201cHow We Got Rolled by the Dishonest Fascists of GamerGate.\\u201d\\u00a0A few months later, the full extent of the damage was revealed \\u2014 Gamergate had cost Gawker seven figures in lost advertising revenue.\\u00a0The myth of invincibility was over.Gawker vs Gamergate had all the features of a historic humiliation. On the one hand, there was Gawker, one of the web\\u2019s Great Powers. A well-resourced, New York-based \\u201cinternet bully\\u201d\\u00a0with a reputation\\u00a0for destroying people. On the other hand, there were gamers \\u2014 disorganised amateurs. It\\u2019s hard to find a better underdog story.Follow Allum Bokhari @LibertarianBlue on Twitter.\", \"article_id\": 291043}"
