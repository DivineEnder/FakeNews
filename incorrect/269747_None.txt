"{\"content\": \"You may remember in a recent story about Helen Thomas\\u2019 anti-Semitic comments, I concluded with challenge:\\n\\nThat\\u2019s if George Soros allows you to.There is no doubt that Media Matters would read and respond to my challenge, after all they have read and criticized my posts before.    Based on their fake criticism of people like Glenn Beck, one would  think they would just love to sink their teeth into a real case of  Antisemitism, after all they are the protector of all things Jewish in  America. Media Matters truly cares about Antisemitism, that\\u2019s why they  spend all of that time protecting George Soros, calling almost everyone who criticizes \\u201cthe spooky dude\\u201d  a Jew hater.Despite  their desire to protect all things Jewish (and my little challenge)  Media Matters has been strangely silent. And the longer their silence,  the more I am concerned for their well-being.\\n\\n[youtube HvmDZ05nMCM]Sunday evening I posted the video of Ms Thomas\\u2019 disgusting speech, that would  certainly rouse Media Matters from their slumber, but when they hadn\\u2019t  criticized Thomas by Monday I was sure that the protector of all things  Jewish had been a victim of foul play. Heck these are the guys who  supported fake charges of Antisemitism against Rush Limbaugh.   The absence of any article  criticizing  the Progressive Thomas\\u2019 hatred was  baffling.I wracked my head trying to come up with a reason.   Maybe, I thought,   there was some sort of massive food poisoning incident at the Media Matters\\u2019 office, like in the movie Airplane.    That had to be it; the only reason Media Matters wouldn\\u2019t bash a media  figure for an actual case of Antisemitism was some sort of mass  illness. So Monday night I called all the hospitals near their office in Washington D.C,  but thank goodness there was no one from Media Matters in any of   those   Hospitals.As  of Wednesday, four days after the original Helen Thomas article ran with the challenge to Media Matters,   news  began to leak out about WikiLeaks\\u2019 supporters attacking   and shutting  down MasterCard (and other sites).Holy Cow that had to be it! Media Matters did execute their Job as protectors of the Jews.   I\\u2019m sure they  did. Heck,   these are the people who defended J Street against charges of being pro-Hamas (even though J Street is pro-Hamas ).   Of course, they went after Helen Thomas for an actual case of Jew-hatred, the  same way they made up Antisemitism just so they could go after    Glenn Beck,  Rush Limbaugh. They probably also bashed daily  Kos and Huffington Post, maybe even Al Sharpton also.It had to be  WikiLeaks\\u2019 fault; they must have hacked into Media  Matters server. Since  Media Matters has the financial backing of rich  progressives like  George Soros, the group should able to afford super  servers that  could fend off most of the attack. Only part of their  server was  attacked, coincidentally it was the part of the server where  they had  written about Helen Thomas, daily Kos, and Huffington Post.There, I feel so much better now!   Tonight I will get a full night of sleep.It  has to be Wikileaks fault. Media Matters is dedicated to defending the  public from misinformation being distributed by media figures.   It\\u2019s an  organization that was formed with the help of honorable people like John  Podesta of Center for American Progress and George Soros these are  major figures in the progressive movement, they elected a president of  the United States for heaven\\u2019s sake!Surely  Media Matters took Helen Thomas to task for her Antisemitism; I bet  they took daily Kos and Huffington Post to task also.   There are only  two explanations for this group which set itself up to be the protector  of the Jewish people either they were hacked by Wikileaks, or they are  world-class hypocrites.   Any organization formed with the help of some  of our President\\u2019s closest supporters such as John Podesta and George  Soros could never be world-class hypocrites, could they?\", \"article_id\": 269747, \"source_id\": 2, \"title\": \"Did Something Bad Happen to Media Matters or Are They Just World-Class Hypocrites?\"}"
