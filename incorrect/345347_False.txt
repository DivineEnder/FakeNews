Here are some of the dynamics to watch:\\\",\\\"Mr. Sanders can be somewhat formulaic in debates and on the stump. He rails against Wall Street, declares that it is time to break up the big banks and get money out of politics, and argues that only a \\u201cpolitical revolution\\u201d can change Washington.\\\",\\\"Beyond that, Mr. Sanders has often evaded and even struggled with thorny questions of policy. Ina long interview with The Daily Newslast week, he repeatedly bristled and dodged when pressed on national security and foreign policy issues, and even on the fine points of some of his core concerns, like banking reform.\\\",\\\"If Mr. Sanders is to put to rest skepticism about his readiness for the presidency \\u2014 and a lingering perception that he is chiefly a potent protest candidate \\u2014 a commanding and fluent debate performance is an essential first step.\\\",\\\"For a candidate who entered the race in a commanding position, Mrs. Clinton has waged a largely defensive campaign, focused on blunting Mr. Sanders\\u2019s appeal to core liberal constituencies and reassuring communities and interest groups that would be critical to her success in a general election.\\\",\\\"In debates, she has often found herself in the uninspiring position of expressing sympathy with Mr. Sanders\\u2019s principles but arguing that the scale and specifics of his promises are unrealistic.\\\",\\\"To put down Mr. Sanders\\u2019s insurgency, Mrs. Clinton might have to break out of that pattern and deliver a message that genuinely excites the Democratic base in a state that twice elected her to the Senate. The debate could be her best opportunity, before the end of primary voting in June, to convey a vision of the presidency more enthralling than the pragmatic pursuit of incremental liberal policy change.\\\",\\\"The news cycle gave Mr. Sanders a big gift on Wednesday, with the revelation thatfive big banks had failed to develop plansfor dismantling themselves in the event of a financial crisis. It is a story that plays directly into Mr. Sanders\\u2019s area of political confidence, and that is an easy cue for him to brandish his core message on the debate stage.\\\",\\\"Mrs. Clinton responded assertively to the news, urging regulators to take on the banks more aggressively. It will be essential for her to project that message with real force in the debate, especially in the almost-certain event that Mr. Sanders once again challenges her friendly relationship with the financial sector.\\\",\\\"Mr. Sanders has battled criticism of his record on gun control throughout the primary campaign, especially over his vote for a measure in Congress stating that gun manufacturers cannot be sued over the criminal use of their products. In many states, the issue has been little hindrance for Mr. Sanders, especially in the rural caucuses where he has performed so well.\\\",\\\"New York is tougher territory on guns. Voters in New York City are overwhelmingly supportive of gun control \\u2014 including, presumably, many of the young liberals who have thrilled to Mr. Sanders\\u2019s economic message. But Mrs. Clinton has gone after his gun record with new intensity in recent days, and Mr. Sanders may face the toughest audience yet for his deviations on the Second Amendment.\\\",\\\"In the Democratic presidential primaries of yore, it was essential for candidates competing in New York to demonstrate their energetic and total support for the state of Israel. At times, the issue became deeply divisive: In the 1988 election, Mayor Edward I. Koch harshly attacked Jesse L. Jackson for his views on Israel, widening a racial rift in New York politics.\\\",\\\"The subject has been far more muted this year, despite marked differences between the candidates. Mrs. Clinton has been a conventional, down-the-line defender of Israel, whereas Mr. Sanders has been a more vocal critic of Israel\\u2019s settlements and its use of military force.\\\",\\\"Unless Israel becomes a matter of dispute on Thursday, it may play no meaningful role in the Democratic race at all. That would be a watershed, of a kind, in New York politics, and perhaps a sign of shifting currents in Democratic politics nationally.\\\"}\"}"
