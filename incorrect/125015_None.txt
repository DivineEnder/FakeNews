"{\"title\": \"'Wire' Creator David Simon Censors Rebuttal to his Anti-Constitution Rant\", \"content\": \"Here at Breitbart News, we spend a lot of time focusing on the liberal bully, so accurately captured in Ben Shapiro\\u2019s recent publication.\\u00a0To paraphrase Mr. Shapiro, the liberal\\u2019s tactic is to, \\u201cBully the living hell out of conservatives\\u2013to shut them up. Then pretend that such bullying is justified\\u2026Hidden beneath the left\\u2019s supposed hatred of bullying lies a passionate love of its vulgar tactics.\\u201d Watch as Mr. Shapiro\\u2019s words literally take shape before your eyes.\\u00a0 Here is Simon\\u2019s original post.Here is my rebuttal, which I posted on his blog. Lesson:\\u00a0Always take the fight to them.Simon responds:From the ideological name-calling\\u2026to the circular-argument fallacy and fundamentalism \\u2026to the ridiculous \\u2026 You aren\\u2019t arguing with me or the actual content of my essay, but with a straw man of your own limited construction. I would recommend that you bring this stuff to the comments at the Fox News site, or maybe Brietbart (sic). Oh, wait. You have. Well done, then. Your water has reached its natural level.My argument was clear: Simon\\u2019s ideological\\u00a0bias drives him to infer that the application of \\u201coriginal intent\\u201d Constitutional interpretation makes one a racist, and that since Conservatives and Libertarians support such interpretations, that they are racists.\\u00a0Simon denies his bias, pretends to be non-partisan, then outs himself by slamming Fox and Breitbart.LESSON: Don\\u2019t take their insults, and make them live up to their own rules. Now, I attempted to clarify my argument in two other posts. It became apparent to me that Simon, like most Liberals, doesn\\u2019t actually understand what \\u201coriginal intent\\u2019 or Constructionalist interpretation mean.\\u00a0You\\u2019ve shifted from \\u201coriginal intent\\u201d to the umbrella of Constructionalism [in another post]. In point of fact, there are numerous differences among Constructionalism, originalism, and textualism. Which do you mean?\\u00a0 [Regardless], your argument still lacks merit factually and logically. Factually, the Constitution would not have been ratified without the Southern states. You leap to the conclusion that because of this political compromise, Constructionalist interpretation of the entire document is morally substandard. So again, I ask, when you say \\u201cConstructionalism\\u201d in regards to Constitutional interpretation, how do you parse what portions are bereft of moral standing and which aren\\u2019t, since some\\u2013but not all\\u2013of the Founders were slaveowners?Furthermore, even the strictest form of Constructionalism refers to emphasizing judicial restraint and fidelity to the original meaning OF THE TEXT. Your argument STILL makes no sense\\u2013that the text, having allegedly been borne of slaveholders, must not be interpreted in that manner. How is interpreting a clause according to original intent immoral, just because SOME of the Founders were slaveholders?If we are not to narrowly interpret [the Constitution], you therefore infer that original intent is invalid, so the opposite may be valid\\u2013namely, that it is a living, breathing documents subject to the whims of the judiciary and their corresponding ideological positioning. I trust you were unhappy with the Bush v Gore decision?\\u00a0 Do we really want justices acting on emotion, or what the original text intended?\\u201d\\nBut Simon refused to post these substantive arguments.\\u00a0Why? Read on.I don\\u2019t wish to have you writing long missives to little effect.\\u00a0Characterization and personalization of all participants, not merely myself, here is frowned upon, and those who can\\u2019t raise their game\\u2026without apology, are consigned to the kill file. [Apology] namely by asking me to take down the link to your Brietbart [sic] screed and posting the same arguments. But this is not Brietbart [sic]. Or the comments section to Fox News or MSNBC or any other ideological jerk-fest\\u2026You have ventured into a small domain of the internet where civility and substance are given great sway.So here we see Simon\\u2019s arrogance. After denying that he engaged in attacks on Conservatives and Libertarians, and that \\u201ccharacterization of all participants is frowned up,\\u201d he expects me to apologize and ask him to remove the link to my article. You know, to uphold the \\u201ccivil standards\\u201d of discourse, like \\u201cpicking up a brick and walking toward that courthouse in Sanford.\\u201d \\u00a0 LESSON: NEVER apologize for holding your ground. Instead, I attempted to engage him in honest discussion by sending in two not-so-lengthy missives directly challenging his arguments. Which he refused to post.\\u00a0 Why did Simon censor the post? To get me to shut up, and because I dismantled his argument and he had no response. Now comes to the tricky part, proving his hypocrisy. LESSON: Make them live up to their own rules. \\u00a0I challenged\\u00a0his claim of civility to another commenter\\u00a0to see if he would respond to the pettier issue, revealing him to be a hypocrite for not responding the substantive issue he so sanctimoniously claimed to elevate. You can guess the outcome: Upon being asked to leave the country by a fellow citizen, I am certainly entitled to be equally blunt\\u2026.Flag-waving, unconditional jingoism and political self-righteousness needs a burr in its ass at all points. I have said so, civilly, and in precise proportion to the offensive nature of the original query. Tellingly, Brendan, who took up the mantle of the original query, has indeed rethought his position and apologized for even attempting to defend that query.\\u00a0You on the other hand, have seized upon the same weak-ass argument, mistaking it as an opportunity to roll once more in the rhetorical gutter. \\u201cYes, Brendan apologized to his Better. Now I reveal Simon\\u2019s hypocrisy. LESSON: Always call them out. Always.\\u201cActually, David, what I did was to send you TWO messages addressing the substance of your article, as you requested. What you did, fine defender of dissent that you are, was to censor them\\u2026yet not censor my other substantive comment.\\u00a0 So I offer them again to you, if you so wish to post them, and elevate YOUR game, by responding.\\u201dAnd that brings us to the exciting conclusion\\u2013906 glorious words that speak for themselves. But I won\\u2019t waste another line on Simon. You can go to his blog and read it yourself.LESSON: Let them hang themselves in public and\\u00a0get your screenshots.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 125015}"
