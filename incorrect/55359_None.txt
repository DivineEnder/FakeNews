She didn\\u2019t complain, that\\u2019s not what you did in that generation. And this is one of the reason that the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.\\\"He continued by telling the story of Lily Ledbetter.\\\"We fixed that -- and that's an example of the kind of advocacy we need because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family,\\\" Obama said. \\\"This is not just a women\\u2019s issue, this is a family issue, a middle-class issue and that\\u2019s why we've got to fight for it.\\\"Romney spoke of his record as governor of Massachusetts and the number of women he appointed to senior cabinet positions.\\\"I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applications seemed to be from men ...\\u00a0and I said gosh, can't we find some women who are also qualified?\\\" he said, talking about reaching out to women's groups to find qualified women for the posts, citing a study that found his administration had the most high-ranking women of all 50 states.He added that the recession has taken its toll on women and that the best way to help them is to improve the economy.\\\"In the last four years, women have lost 580,000 jobs. ...\\u00a03.5 million more women [are] now in poverty than four years ago,\\\" he said. \\\"What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have an economy so strong that employers are looking for more employees.\\\"Obama fired back, pointing to the incident earlier this year where a Romney staffer wasn't sure whether the candidate supported the Lily Ledbetter Act.Romney \\\"said I\\u2019ll get back to you, and that\\u2019s not the kind of advocacy women need in any economy,\\\" Obama said.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
