The goal is to bring a sense of spontaneity and accessibility to one of the world\\u2019s most choreographed and constricted positions.\\\",\\\"Leading the charge is Mr. Obama\\u2019s Office of Digital Strategy, a team of roughly 20 aides who spend their days managing his Twitter account and the White HouseFacebook page,Instagram accountandYouTube channel.\\\",\\\"Led by Jason Goldman, a 39-year-old former executive at Twitter, Blogger and Medium, the team has a variety of tasks, including live-tweeting presidential speeches in 140-character squibs from the White House Twitter account and using analytics to track which issues may be most ripe for a web video or graphic and then producing them.\\\",\\\"More than anything else, they are looking for ways to establish a digital identity for Mr. Obama. They say the old conventions of White House communications \\u2014 a major policy address, a television or newspaper interview or a written statement \\u2014 are less and less effective.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOur office is very much tasked and looking for ways to bring his voice directly to people,\\u201d said Kori Schulman, Mr. Goldman\\u2019s deputy, who has worked on the president\\u2019s digital team since 2009. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a balance of focusing on the president\\u2019s priorities and being flexible and opportunistic as conversations are happening online that relate to what the president cares about.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Technology has long been crucial to Mr. Obama\\u2019s politics. His campaign\\u2019s pioneering use of data analytics helped propel him to the White House, where he was the first president to use email and now is rarely seen without his iPad. In April, he named Mr. Goldman as the first chief digital officer, architect of the White House\\u2019s digital initiatives.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOne of the things he wanted to do was to open the White House, to pull the curtains back and show people how government works, and this was a natural progression in that,\\u201d Jennifer Psaki, the communications director, said of Mr. Obama. \\u201cHe\\u2019s always coming to us and looking for ways to engage, and it is a challenging thing to do from the White House, because you\\u2019re running the country.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Goldman and Ms. Schulman attend communications meetings each morning in the West Wing to help figure out when Mr. Obama should insert himself into the digital mix and alert him when something is trending on Twitter or generating heavy traffic on Facebook.\\\",\\\"In November 2013, images of Miles Scott, a 5-year-old leukemia patient dressed as Batman fighting crime in his hometown, San Francisco, sparked an Internet outpouring, and Mr. Obama\\u2019s aides thought \\u201cBatkid\\u201d should hear from the president. They used 30 seconds at the end of the weekly taping of Mr. Obama\\u2019s Saturday radio address to have him record asix-second Vine, saying: \\u201cWay to go, Miles. Way to save Gotham.\\u201d\\\",\\\"More recently, top officials have become more open to devoting presidential time to social media, after Mr. Obama\\u2019s digital gurus showed their colleagues with data metrics how his appearances on social media \\u2014 like YouTube videos he starred in to promote themes of hisState of the Union addressin January \\u2014 helped spread his message.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t know what the reception for this was going to be, and it turns out that we were pretty validated,\\u201d Nathaniel Lubin, who formerly led Mr. Obama\\u2019s digital and Internet efforts, said of the State of the Union videos. \\u201cThose videos being successful has gone a long way toward demonstrating how powerful this could be as a platform for the president.\\u201d\\\",\\\"WhenMr. Obama traveled to Alaskain August to build public awareness about climate change, he took over the White House Instagram account. For several days the president wielded a GoPro camera and a selfie stick to capture receding glaciers, and shared his every picture and video as if he were just another American guy taking a spectacular summer vacation.\\\",\\\"The reality is, of course, different. Mr. Obama\\u2019s tweets are sometimes written and almost always sent by aides. He follows only 70 accounts on Twitter, mostly government agencies, members of his cabinet and senior staff, Chicago sports teams and Bill Clinton. His spontaneous replies on digital platforms are rare.\\\",\\\"Like the man himself, Mr. Obama\\u2019s personality on social media can sometimes veer into the dry and professorial. He particularly likes to tweet what his aides refer to as fact series, several 140-character bursts of facts and figures about an issue \\u2014 like gun violence or criminal justice \\u2014 he is pushing.\\\",\\\"Increasingly, the White House is using Mr. Obama to break news over social media. His first reaction to theSupreme Court\\u2019s ruling establishing a right tosame-sex marriagenationwide in Junewas on Twitter, where he called the decision \\u201ca big step in our march toward equality.\\u201d He added the hashtag#LoveWins, which quickly became a trending topic.\\\",\\\"\\u201cUltimately, what all of this is about is finding ways to communicate with people in a time when media has become so disaggregated that simply communicating through the traditional means is woefully insufficient,\\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama\\u2019s former senior adviser and an architect of his digital strategy.\\\",\\\"Social media can also be a powerful tool for burnishing the president\\u2019s image with a sometimes-fickle public. One of the most viewed postings the White House has ever shared is aYouTube videoof the president taking an impromptu stroll near the White House last year, quipping \\u201cthe bear is loose\\u201d as he shook hands with awe-struck tourists.\\\",\\\"It was a time when \\u201cwe were really getting beaten up, and there was no break in the narrative,\\u201d said Mr. Pfeiffer, recalling how the rise of the Islamic State was capturing public attention. \\u201cAnd here we had this glimpse of the president as we all wished people could see him.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
