"{\"title\": \"Trump Defends Muslim Ban --- Constitution Doesn't Necessarily Give Us the Right to Commit Suicide\", \"content\": \"Sunday on NBC\\u2019s \\u201cMeet The Press,\\u201d while discussing banning Muslims form certain territories, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down on a claim he had made a week earlier in an interview with CBS\\u2019s \\u201c60 Minutes\\u201d with his vice-presidential pick Gov. Mike Pence (R-IN), which was the\\u00a0Constitution was \\u201cgreat,\\u201d but it didn\\u2019t \\u201cnecessarily give us the right to commit suicide.\\u201dTrump said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think so. I actually don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a pull back in fact, you could say it\\u2019s an expansion. I\\u2019m looking now at territories. People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Remember this. I\\u2019m OK\\u00a0with that because I\\u2019m talking territory instead of Muslim. But just remember this, our Constitution is great, but it doesn\\u2019t necessarily give us the right to commit suicide, OK? We have a religious, everybody wants to be protected, and that\\u2019s great and that\\u2019s a wonderful part of our Constitution. I view it differently. Why are we committing suicide? Why are we doing that? I live with our Constitution. I love our Constitution. I cherish our Constitution. We\\u2019re making it territorial. We have nations and will come out with a number of the places and it\\u2019s very complex.\\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 162953}"
