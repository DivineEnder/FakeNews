They are still scrambling to figure out an appropriate answer.Ronald Reagan used this phrase to bedevil President Jimmy Carter in 1980. The Georgian couldn\\u2019t respond either \\u2014 though the voters could.Simple and elegant, the question still resonates and can be used to devastating effect. Is it d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 vu all over again?The 1980 campaign was historic for many reasons. Reagan\\u2019s election signaled a radical new direction for America, changing the national morale, the economy and the national defense and foreign policy for more than a generation. For the populist conservative ran not only against the Washington establishment \\u2014 he ran against the GOP establishment.Each campaign seems to produce its own emblematic quote, like Sen. Lloyd Bensten\\u2019s cringing putdown of Dan Quayle in 1988, \\u201cYou\\u2019re no Jack Kennedy.\\u201d The 1980 Reagan-Carter campaign had more than its share. Carter\\u2019s \\u201cI asked my daughter Amy what she thought the most important issue was, and she said nuclear weaponry\\u201d was one; Reagan\\u2019s \\u201cThere you go again\\u201d was another.But the phrase that likely sealed the deal with voters was \\u201cAre you better off that you were four years ago?\\u201d \\u2014 which the Gipper used in his summation at the Reagan-Carter debate.The question remains, however, where did this quote come from?David Gergen, a former Nixon and Ford aide, says he gave it to Reagan, though many who participated in Reagan debate prep don\\u2019t remember this.Reagan was a talented phrase-maker in his own right. During one mock debate session, Rep. David Stockman of Michigan, standing in for Carter, was pummeling the GOP nominee. Reagan got angry. \\u201cDamn it!\\u201d he said, \\u201cHere you go again!\\u201dHis debate team laughed. Reagan relaxed, smiled and said that maybe he\\u2019d tuck it away, to use in the real debate. At another session, Stockman was hitting him on the environment and Reagan got another laugh with, \\u201cGee David, maybe I\\u2019d better get a gas mask!\\u201d That line, fortunately, did not make the debate.So where did that key question originate? Reagan had been trying similar phrases on the campaign trail that fall. But a newly uncovered memo offers a clue.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
