"{\"article_id\": 33795, \"title\": \"SAFE Act memo doesn't quell primary threats\", \"content\": \"ALBANY\\u2014After stewing over the weekend about an agreement to freeze development of an ammunition sales database, conservative Republicans and gun-rights advocates renewed their vow to launch primary campaigns against several G.O.P. senators who support the agreement.Many upstate Republicans remain furious with Majority Leader John Flanagan and other G.O.P. senators who supported Governor Andrew Cuomo's SAFE Act, a gun-control measure passed after the Sandy Hook school massacre in 2012. Flanagan and Jim Malatras, a top aide to Cuomo, released a memorandum of understanding late Friday that will effectively pause development of the already-stalled database, which was part of the SAFE Act's provisions.The memorandum was a big win for Flanagan, a Long Islander who became majority leader this year after besting John DeFrancisco of Syracuse. Upstaters\\u2014and many gun rights activists\\u2014unsuccessfully pushed for DeFrancisco, in part because the Long Island Republican delegation supported the SAFE Act.\\u201cThe SAFE Act memorandum of understanding had the tactical effect of a 2,000-pound bomb dropped from a B-52 flown by a blind pilot,\\\" wrote Jake Palmateer, an activist with NY2A, an organization opposed to the legislation. Palmeeter noted that several Republican officials, including Assemblymen Pete Lopez and Bill Nojay, spoke against the memorandum at a rally in Chenango County on Saturday.While the memorandum put a temporary hold on a program that has never been implemented, it reiterated the state's intention to compile the database of ammunition purchases at some point in the future.Palmateer wrote that Republicans in control of the Senate had lost their way, and he and his allies would support challengers in G.O.P. primaries as well as on third-party lines \\u201cas punishment to the Senate G.O.P.\\u201d Carl Paladino, a Buffalo developer aligned with the Republicans' conservative, populist, upstate wing, said he would also push against the six upstate senators who supported Flanagan's election as majority leader.\\u201cFlanagan and the group of six are in for an eye opener next year. They think we're all provincials here in upstate New York, and they're in for a rude awakening,\\u201d Paladino said by phone.Some Republican senators said the agreement was a positive step forward, considering the political realities of the state. (Cuomo has touted the act as a signature achievement, and it enjoys hearty support among his fellow Democrats who dominate the state Assembly.)State Senator Pat Gallivan, a Republican from rural Erie County, dismissed Palmateer's threats as posturing.\\u201cThe SAFE Act itself, many of us believe, was ill-conceived. Many of us believe a number of the provisions were unworkable\\u2014including the ammunition database that doesn't exist anywhere else in the country,\\u201d Gallivan, a former sheriff who voted for DeFrancisco and against the SAFE Act, said on \\u201cThe Capitol Pressroom.\\u201d \\\"People posture in this world of politics and they have strong beliefs one way or another. In government, what I want to focus on is issues. \\u2026 I voted against it .. and will continue to work to repeal it or relieve law-abiding gun owners of the most onerous aspects of it.\\u201dA free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York education policy and politics.A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York energy policy and politics.A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York health care policy and politics.A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York health care policy and politics.A morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on state news and politics.A morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on city news and politics.A weekly round-up of legislation in City Council for politics and policy professionals.A reported briefing on money in politics, executive moves, and trends in communications, lobbying and consulting.A twice-a-week digest of news on courts and the law in New YorkAzi Paybarah and Jimmy Vielkind's must-read briefing informing the daily conversation among knowledgeable New Yorkers.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
