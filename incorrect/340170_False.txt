Thebills, drafted by Representative Ra\\u00fal R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho, and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, already have 130 co-sponsors. On Thursday, the Republican Study Committee, the largest, most organized group of conservatives in the House, demanded a vote.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAll religious Americans deserve assurance that they can carry out their conscience without a federal government crackdown,\\u201d said Representative Bill Flores, Republican of Texas and the committee\\u2019s chairman.\\\",\\\"At the same time, wary Republican moderates have quietly drafted a novel alternative that would actually expand legal protections for gay men and lesbians. Their legislation would narrow the scope of protection offered to groups declining services to same-sex couples seeking to marry.\\\",\\\"The brewing dispute is coming at a delicate time for theRepublican Party. Donald J. Trump, the billionaire businessman seeking the Republican nomination for president, has stirred up Hispanic voters with the anti-Mexican and illegal immigration diatribes he has delivered since beginning his campaign. Last week, after Republican governors in South Carolina and Alabama pressed for the removal of the Confederate battle flag at their capitols, Southern Republicans in the House moved to preserve the right to lay those flags on Confederate graves at federal cemeteries, prompting an uproar led by African-American House members.\\\",\\\"Republican leaders have found themselves once again caught in a wedge between the conservative sentiments of the majority of their conference and the more liberal social trends in the nation at large. Asked about the First Amendment Defense Act, which is the name of the bill to protect tax-exempt organizations and individuals objecting to same-sex marriage on religious grounds, House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio on Thursday was careful not to dismiss it even as he declined to embrace it.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe Supreme Court\\u2019s decision on marriage raises a lot of other questions, and a number of members have concerns about issues that it raises and how they might be addressed,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut no decision has been made on how best to address these.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The bill proposed by moderates, though, would attach two provisions expanding protections long-sought by gay rights groups: the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which outlaws workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, and an amendment to the federal Fair Housing Act to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protected characteristics of housing seekers.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis opens up a can of worms, and Congress needs to show it can do two things at once: protect religious freedoms and provide legal protections for nondiscrimination,\\u201d Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, said Friday.\\\",\\\"Mr. Dent told his colleagues in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday that they were risking the same protests from business leaders and other gay rights supporters that Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana prompted in March when he signed legislation allowing businesses to refuse services to same-sex couples. The bill was quickly amended to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\\\",\\\"His appeal was greeted with silence, he said, but \\u201cthe message was delivered.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI would really hate to see the Indiana nightmare turn into a national debacle,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had intended to formally draft the bill next week, but its chairman, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, said Friday it is now unlikely that drafting will come before Congress\\u2019s August recess.\\\",\\\"At the same time, Republican leaders made it clear they saw a need for a legislative response to the court\\u2019s action. Without legal protection, Republicans fear religious broadcasters could lose their federal licenses if they do not grantsame-sex marriagebenefits to employees. Faith-based charities like World Vision, which rely on government grants, could face pressure \\u2014 or even the loss of their tax-exempt status \\u2014 if they do not drop requirements that employees sign a statement of faith, including respect for \\u201ctraditional\\u201d marriage. Catholic schools risk losing federal teacher-assistance grants and assistance with school meals, Republicans say.\\\",\\\"Mr. Labrador, in an interview Friday, said he was willing to work with Mr. Dent \\u2014 and even the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\\u2019s largest gay rights group \\u2014 to get the language right, although he said measures expanding legal protections for homosexuals were outside the scope of the bill.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to draft the narrowest bill possible. We\\u2019re just trying to protect people\\u2019s freedom of religion,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Gay rights advocates say those concerns are overblown. In the last 30 years, only a handful of organizations have ever lost their tax-exempt status, and those have been mainly over fraud charges. Religious organizations that do not hire women have never been threatened.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe right to believe is fundamental. The right to use taxpayer dollars to discriminate is not,\\u201d Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, said Friday.\\\",\\\"The moderate Republican alternative would draw religious protections narrowly, ensuring that they shielded religious nonprofit organizations from threats to their tax-exempt status and other federal benefits because of their adherence to heterosexual marriage, according to a one-page description of the legislation circulating in the House.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
