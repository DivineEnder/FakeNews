And the coin of the 2016 Republican presidential race has been anger and fear.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m very angry,\\u201ddeclaresDonald J. Trump, who has won three straight contests. The victor in Iowa, Senator Ted Cruz, warns in hushed tones that the United States faces \\u201cthe abyss.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Senator Marco Rubio, stoking conservative anger by accusing President Obama of deliberately damaging the nation,tells voters, \\u201cThere may be no turning back.\\u201d\\\",\\\"It\\u2019s no surprise, then, that Gov.John R. Kasichremains a pauper in the Republican campaign. Alone among major contenders, the second-term Ohio governor doesn\\u2019t employ applause lines about the evils of Mr. Obama or apocalyptic portraits of American decline. He laughed in an interview at the language employed by his rivals.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think people want to live in the dark,\\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \\u201cIf that\\u2019s where the market is, then they\\u2019re probably not buying me. But I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s where the market is.\\u201d\\\",\\\"With poor results in Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada, he has only a surprisesecond-place finishin New Hampshire as evidence. There, he staged a blitz of town hall appearances that emphasized pragmatic problem-solving, drawing on his record as a budget-balancing congressman and governor who has presided over an economic revival in a critical Midwestern battleground.\\\",\\\"Now, with the least campaign cash of any contender, he is hoping to survive the 11-state set of Super Tuesday primaries next week and keep his candidacy alive until he can reach neighboring Michigan on March 8 and his home state\\u2019s winner-take-all primary on March 15.\\\",\\\"All the while, he\\u2019ll face pressure to abandon the race from mainstream party leaders who loathe Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz and believe Mr. Rubio is their best bet.\\\",\\\"It\\u2019s not Mr. Kasich\\u2019s policies that distinguish him from the field. He\\u2019s an anti-abortion social conservative who signed a law this week in Ohio barring state contracts with Planned Parenthood.\\\",\\\"Like his rivals, he has proposed deep tax cuts to stimulate the economy. His plan to lower the current top rate of 39.6 percent to 28 percent, the same figure PresidentRonald Reagansigned into law in 1986, matches a proposal advanced by the onetime front-runner Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida.\\\",\\\"Mr. Bush\\u2019s departurefrom the race makes Mr. Kasich the only candidate to have served as a governor. In past campaigns, Jimmy Carter, Mr. Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush used executive experience at the state level as a valuable credential when seeking the Oval Office.\\\",\\\"That matters less in 2016. For all the numbers Mr. Kasich reels off about adding jobs and turning Ohio\\u2019s deficit into a surplus, governing experience represents a liability for the many Republican voters who blame politicians for their uncertain economic future.\\\",\\\"Mr. Kasich\\u2019s more potent distinction, his strategists believe, is his optimism. Where rivals paint scathing black-and-white contrasts with Mr. Obama, Mr. Kasich speaks in practical terms about how presidents must compromise.\\\",\\\"His tempered portrait more closely matches the reality of a country in which unemployment and budget deficits have sharply declined, even though middle-class incomes remain stagnant. Instead of foreboding, he conveys empathy.\\\",\\\"Mr. Kasich defends his decision to expandMedicaidunder Mr. Obama\\u2019s health law, apostasy to Republican rivals, as a hand up to the drug-addicted and mentally ill that saves money. He hugs troubled voters and, at times, sheds a tear with them.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think my candidacy represents hope to people,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t have solutions to these problems, and if we dwell on the negatives and not on the positives, how are we going to get out of this? How are we going to change things?\\u201d\\\",\\\"The slender hope for Mr. Kasich\\u2019s candidacy rests on his ability to rapidly leverage that brand into a much larger share of the Republican audience. All available signs cast doubt. One month into the contest, Mr. Kasich has the market for optimism all to himself.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
