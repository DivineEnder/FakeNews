"{\"source_id\": 2, \"title\": \"Once More Unto The Breach: Farage Returns To Thanet To Drum Up Support For 'Leave'\", \"content\": \"I was with Mr. Farage, albeit on the other side of the camera when he challenged the establishment in the South Thanet seat in 2015. We lost, as you\\u2019re probably aware, though we had a massive 27 per cent swing in our favour. Now it is becoming increasingly clear that the Conservative Party may have cheated with their spending last year, and it\\u2019s the talk of the town. That and the referendum.\\u201cOnce more unto the breach\\u201dSo once more unto the breach for Nigel as he toured the town centre: \\u201cBringing back memories is it, Raheem?\\u201d he said. And it indeed it did.But it was also an interesting journalistic endeavour to have been on one side, and watch them from the outside now.\\u201cRaheem, where do we go?\\u201d they asked, unsure of the lay of the high street, and wary that some \\u201cantis\\u201d \\u2013 Hope Not Hate activists \\u2013 would turn up and ruin their fun. Nigel was too busy shaking hands and popping into local shops to notice.\\u201cAre we voting Leave?\\u201d he asked four men outside the Village Grill cafe. \\u201cAbsolutely,\\u201d they replied, before going onto joke that they had only arrived in town \\u201cfor a quiet cup of tea\\u201d before being dazzled by dozens of cameramen, activists, and well-wishers.Ramsgate felt different yesterday. There weren\\u2019t the throngs of Labour supporters hurling abuse at the UKIP leader. There wasn\\u2019t the faint sense that \\u201cwe might lose\\u201d. Ramsgate and indeed South Thanet are most definitely voting to Leave the European Union.Behind the UKIP bus was a slightly more modern, air-conditioned, sleek coach. A perfect analogy, really. It belonged to Geenpiel, the Dutch activists who forced a referendum on the European Union in the Netherlands \\u2013 and won \\u2013 using modern media, online activism, and even drones. Nigel kept recalling to me the drones from when he visited during the Dutch plebiscite.The GeenPeil bus, with UKIP outrider, navigates the tight roads in South Thanet\\u201cI\\u2019ve never shot a drone,\\u201d he mused on several occasions.Emblazoned on the side of the GeenPeil coach are the words: \\u201cOn The Road To Democracy\\u201d.\\u201cWe\\u2019re here to return the favour of Nigel coming to the Netherlands,\\u201d they told me.It is evident to me, as ever, that the UKIP campaign is hardly the slickest, most organised in the world. But there\\u2019s a charm to that hodge-podge,\\u00a0\\u201cwhere do we go now?\\u201d, minimal-itinerary approach. It may not be the best use of Nigel\\u2019s time, but there are some in UKIP who wouldn\\u2019t have it any other way. And it keeps the \\u201cantis\\u201d on their toes. Despite a call to action against Farage yesterday, they were unable to locate or disrupt him.And Nigel and co were fully aware that while we\\u2019re moving into a \\u201cget out the vote\\u201d part of the campaign \\u2013 with just over eight days to go until the referendum \\u2013 they still had minds to change. The butchers he visited were sceptical, clearly what we\\u2019d call \\u201cSoft Leavers\\u201d who might return to the status quo at the last minute, in the polling booth, voting for the status quo in the face of uncertainty or risk. But Farage set them right.Farage convinces the butchers\\u201cAll I\\u2019ve ever known is in,\\u201d said the proprietor, to which Nigel replied, \\u201cThe key is we will be in charge of our own destiny\\u2026 to be honest, what our forebears fought for. So that we could be a free, independent nation.\\u201dIndeed it is these arguments, about sovereignty, about democracy, and about national identity that are ringing true the most which Britons up and down the country.\\u201cI am calling time on our membership of the European Union!\\u201dVote Leave \\u2013 the official campaign designated by the Electoral Commission \\u2013 were insistent that this should not form the crux of the campaign. But in the past two weeks they too have come around to Farage\\u2019s message, and now all the polls point to leaving.The second best response to yesterday\\u2019s tour was in Birchington \\u2013 an area which saw two Tories and three UKIP councillors elected in 2015.Atop the bus in BirchingtonIt was there that Nigel showed his eclectic appeal: being dragged into a nail salon one minute and a pub the next.\\u201cThat\\u2019s a really famous person!\\u201d one mother told her child. \\u201cI\\u2019m actually really surprised. I\\u2019m really excited,\\u201d she declared as Nigel stopped to talk selfies, bounding into the road as cars honked their horns and stopped, their drivers declaring, \\u201cOut! Out! Out!\\u201dChatting with the beauty parlour galsBut the best response was in Sittingbourne, where once again (unto the breach) the UKIP bus blasted out the theme from the Great Escape as it trundled over the cobbled high street.In the crowd of scores of supporters, there was just one person openly against leaving the European Union. She said it was because of \\u201cwomen\\u2019s rights and human rights\\u201d. Breitbart London noted that she seemed to be the one person that the Times journalist who was also present insisted on speaking to at length.\\u201cYou tell \\u2019em, Nigel!\\u201d screamed one woman, as throngs of supporters young and old lunged for selfies. One woman even asked him to sign her arm.And a group of young, black students found themselves face-to-face with Farage, having been reticent to make contact, discussing in amongst themselves whether he was a \\u201cracist\\u201d or not.\\u201cYou know what Nige! Nige! You know what? You\\u2019re a decent guy,\\u201d said one boy, clutching his \\u201cWe Want Our Country Back\\u201d poster, just after Nigel had signed it.Students gleefully pose with FarageAnd for those concerned, Nigel also looks refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to take the fight to the establishment over the closing week of the campaign.Farage looks healthy, stern, and confident\\u201cHe looks really well,\\u201d one of his aides told me on Saturday afternoon. \\u201cI really think we can do this,\\u201d he told me.\\nBut of course it is still all to play for, and some things can still go wrong.The trip was slightly marred when panicked press officers heard about a new graphic from the Farage-backed Leave.EU campaign.\\u201cIslamist extremism is a real threat to our way of life,\\u201d the social-media graphic read, alluding to the Orlando terror attacks. \\u201cAct now before we see an Orlando-style atrocity here before too long\\u201d it concluded.Talking to journalists on top of the Battle BusPersonally, I saw no problem with the graphic. Those complaining about it were members of the liberal-left media establishment, and throngs of Twitter-obsessed \\u2018Remain\\u2019 campaigners. Nigel and his team, however, distanced himself from Leave.EU. He told the Wall Street Journal and the Times that he supports every Leave group, not specifically Leave.EU.Whatever you think of the graphic, or rather, the speed at which is was released: the facts are not changed. European Union membership does increase the likelihood of Islamist-inspired terror in the United Kingdom and across Europe. We know Islamists are using Europe\\u2019s open borders and Schengen Agreement to travel freely across the continent. Britain remaining in the EU will arguably lead to further integration, perhaps even membership of Schengen and the Euro.But it was a point that neither Farage, nor the Leave.EU campaign leaders who I spoke to yesterday, seemed keen to make. Instead, Leave.EU removed the graphic and blamed it on an office junior.These sorts of incidents could hurt the campaign \\u2013 albeit in a miniscule way \\u2013 over the next week. But not because of the message. More because they are reluctant to stand by the absolute, hard, and uncomfortable facts surrounding security and terrorism.Chatting with Breitbart Londons editor in chief Raheem KassamBut what was abundantly clear yesterday is that members of the public of all backgrounds, races, religions, and ethnicities are voting to Leave.Remain campaign assertions, as well as media suggestions that the Leave campaign is constituted solely of old, white, angry men is not played out on the streets of Britain.And it\\u2019s not a idea borne out by the polling either.Women, for instance, are more likely to vote Leave. Black and ethnic minorities are becoming more likely to vote Leave, with 30 per cent of them currently supporting the cause.And that was evident in Ramsgate from the moment of arrival, when taxi driver Enes, from Turkey, told me he was desperate for Britain to Leave the failing European Union.\\u2026and with shopkeepersHe cited concerns over immigration \\u2013 not the cultural problems, but primarily the sheer numbers coming into Britain \\u2013 as his reason for leaving.So when people say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s all to play for\\u201d right now \\u2013 that\\u2019s not entirely true. The Leave campaign has the Farage momentum (Fomentum?) \\u2013 but it now needs to ramp up the pressure on the Prime Minister and the \\u2018Remain\\u2019 establishment, as voters are, as we know from experience, more likely to vote for the status quo on the day.So once more unto the breach\\u2026P.S. Farage isn\\u2019t the technophobe he\\u2019s portrayed as! Here he is using an iPad with some competency.\\u00a0Follow Raheem Kassam on TwitterPictures by Rachel Megawhat for Breitbart London\", \"article_id\": 301770}"
