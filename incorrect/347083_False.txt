"{\"title\": \"Inside the List\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Man in Motion:The singer Bobby Brown has a memoir on this week\\u2019s \\u00adhardcover nonfiction list \\u2014 \\u201cEvery Little Step,\\u201d co-written with Nick Chiles, debuts at No. 9. Brown rose to fame with New Edition in the 1980s before drug problems and a turbulent marriage to Whitney Houston made him a mainstay of police blotters, cementing his tabloid reputation as \\u201cthe bad boy of R&amp;B.\\u201d Those days are behind him now, according to the memoir, but Brown is still willing to share the wild details. Among frank \\u00adpassages about liaisons with Madonna, Janet Jackson and an entertainer at his bachelor party (\\u201cLet me say the night with the midget blew my mind\\u201d), Brown casually announces he\\u2019s also had a close encounter of the paranormal kind: \\u201cOne memorable night, one of the ghosts \\u00addescended from the ceiling and had sex with me. .\\u2008.\\u2008. And let me add this: This was before I ever touched any drug besides weed and alcohol.\\u201d The book isn\\u2019t all sex and drugs, though. There\\u2019s plenty of rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll, too. \\u201cMy God, funk was everything to me,\\u201d Brown says of his listening habits when he was growing up in Boston. \\u201cWhen I put on the funk, I\\u2019d start the dancing.\\u201d He adds that, in the rough projects where he lived, his sense of rhythm offered him a kind of protection. \\u201cAlthough violence was always around us, one of the main ways I battled back then was not with my fists \\u2014 it was with my dance moves. I wasn\\u2019t necessarily confident about my singing yet, but I knew I could whup anybody\\u2019s ass in a dance battle. .\\u2008.\\u2008. Break dancing, pop locking \\u2014 man, I was unbelievable.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Dear Diary:Emma Cline\\u2019s first novel,\\u201cThe Girls\\u201d\\u2014 new at No.\\u202f3 on the hardcover fiction list \\u2014 is about the young followers of a Charles Manson-like cult in 1969 California. So how did Cline, who is 27, research the period she\\u2019s writing about? One way was by reading her mother\\u2019s girlhood diary. As useful as it was, she told The Press Democrat in Sonoma County, where she grew up, it was also something of a letdown. \\u201cI expected it would be all about man landing on the moon,\\u201d she said. \\u201cInstead, it was about how she had a bad haircut or had a crush on a boy. But that was very helpful to keep in mind when writing about the \\u201960s, to think about how a 14-year-old girl without experience was in that cultural moment. So it was important to stay away from some of the most familiar \\u201960s signposts and not overdo it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mutual Admiration Society:Elin Hilderbrand is back on the hardcover fiction list with her latest Nantucket novel, \\u201cHere\\u2019s to Us,\\u201d new at No.\\u202f5.
