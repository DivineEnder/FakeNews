"{\"article_id\": 341293, \"title\": \"1 in 4 Women Experience Sex Assault on Campus\", \"content\": \"{\\\"In four years of college, more than one-fourth of undergraduate women at a large group of leading universities said they had been sexually assaulted by force or when they were incapacitated, according to one of the largest studies of its kind, released Monday.\\\",\\\"Responding toa survey commissioned by the Association of American Universities, 27.2 percent of female college seniors reported that, since entering college, they had experienced some kind of unwanted sexual contact \\u2014 anything from touching to rape \\u2014 carried out by incapacitation, usually due to alcohol or drugs, or by force. Nearly half of those, 13.5 percent, had experienced penetration, attempted penetration or oral sex.\\\",\\\"The survey bolstered findings from previous studies but stands out for its sheer size \\u2014 150,000 students at 27 colleges and universities took part last spring \\u2014 and for the prominence of the institutions involved, which include many of the nation\\u2019s elite campuses, including all of theIvy Leagueexcept Princeton.\\\",\\\"Last year, President Obama convened the firstWhite House task forceon college sexual assault, part of a growing demand for colleges to acknowledge, measure and address the problem. That task force, like members of Congress and victim advocates, called on colleges to conduct rigorous \\u201ccampus climate\\u201d surveys, including detailed information on the frequency of assault and harassment.\\\",\\\"Previous studies have estimated that about one in five women are sexually assaulted while at college, though comparisons are difficult because the studies use varying definitions of sexual assault.\\\",\\\"The new study cautioned that only 19 percent of students responded to the survey, far below the rates of some previous studies.\\\",\\\"The A.A.U. survey found that even in the most serious assaults, those involving penetration, almost three-fourths of victims did not report the episode to anyone in authority, let alone law enforcement. The reason victims gave most often for not reporting episodes was that they did not think the episodes were serious enough to report; others said they felt ashamed, or did not think they would be taken seriously.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis survey is significant confirmation of a major problem, and it confirms what we\\u2019ve been saying about the mind-set on campus and the reception survivors expect to encounter,\\u201d said Zoe Ridolfi-Starr, deputy director of Know Your IX, an advocacy group that fights sexual assault.\\\",\\\"Most of the institutions in the study released their own figures from the survey, and several of the most respected ones had some of the highest rates of sexual assault by force or incapacitation for undergraduate women \\u2014 34.6 percent at Yale, 34.3 percent at the University of Michigan, and 29.2 percent at Harvard.\\\",\\\"The findings were \\u201cprofoundly troubling,\\u201d said Yale\\u2019s president, Peter Salovey. Yale\\u2019s handling of sexual assault hascome under particular scrutinyin recent years, and the university has taken a number of steps to address it. Thomas Conroy, a university spokesman, said Monday that because the A.A.U. report was the first of its kind for Yale it was impossible to know whether those measures had paid off.\\\",\\\"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, praised the study but expressed impatience that Congress had not acted to force colleges to improve their handling of sexual assault. \\u201cHow many surveys will it take before we act with the urgency these crimes demand?\\u201d she asked.\\\",\\\"Some previous studies have focused more narrowly on rape and attempted rape, but the A.A.U. survey included much broader categories. It found that, when including acts carried out without force or incapacitation but with coercion or a lack of consent \\u2014 which some colleges now define as sexual assault \\u2014 one-third of senior women had experienced unwanted sexual contact during college.\\\",\\\"John D. Foubert, a professor of higher education at Oklahoma State University who studies campus sexual assault, said he was troubled by the low response rate and by the A.A.U. study\\u2019s use of slightly different definitions from previous studies.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis is pretty consistent with what we\\u2019ve seen before,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Across the 27 universities, men experienced much lower \\u2014 but still significant \\u2014 rates of sexual assault than women; 8.6 percent of male seniors said they had experienced some kind of unwanted sexual contact, including 2.9 percent who said they had experienced penetration, attempted penetration or oral sex, carried out by force or incapacitation.\\\",\\\"Transgender students and others who do not identify as either male or female had higher rates of assault than women. Experts said this was the first large-scale study they knew of to measure the extent of the problem for transgender students.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
