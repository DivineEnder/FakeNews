It shares a border with Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.In a statement, Maliki, a Shiite himself, said the army, anti-terrorism squad, and the Iraqi air force dislodged ISIS in Ramadi, Rudaw reports.\\u201cWe salute our heroes that returned the trust of their people and proved the power of success when the forces are united,\\u201d said Maliki.He specifically praised the Shiite militia forces for liberating Ramadi, although his remarks contradicted earlier reports that such armed groups, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMG), did not play a role in taking back the Sunni city.\\u201cHis statement made no mention of the aerial support that was an integral part of the offensive for Ramadi,\\u201d notes Rudaw.Since July, the American-led coalition has launched 630 airstrikes as part of the Ramadi campaign, including three on Sunday that hit 18 targets, according to Col. Steve Warren, the Baghdad-based spokesman for the international alliance.The U.S. has also spent billions to arm and develop the Iraqi security forces.U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Col. Warren did congratulate the Iraqi armed forces for capturing Ramadi.\\u201cWe congratulate the Iraqi Security Forces for their continued success against ISIL in Ramadi\\u2026 The coalition has provided steadfast support to the Iraqi government to enable them to fight and win against ISIL,\\u201d said Warren in a statement.He noted that coalition support included \\u201ctraining several Iraqi Army brigades, [Counterterrorism] units and federal and local police forces who fought in Ramadi, providing specialized engineering equipment to clear IEDs [Improvised Explosive Devices] and VBIEDs [Vehicle-Borne IEDs]: and providing advice and assistance at multiple Iraqi Army headquarters\\u2026\\u201dRAMADI: My statement on Ramadi success today. pic.twitter.com/NXFqaFUofC\\u2014 COL Steve Warren (@OIRSpox) December 28, 2015\\u201cThe expulsion of ISIL by Iraqi security forces, supported by our international coalition, is a significant step forward in the campaign to defeat this barbaric group and restore Iraq\\u2019s territorial sovereignty,\\u201d added Carter in a statement.On Monday, the Iraqi army reported that it had reached the city center and was in control of the government complex.Ramadi fell into the hands of ISIS jihadists in May in what was considered the Iraqi army\\u2019s second humiliating loss after their defeat in Mosul in 2014.The success by Iraqi military forces in\\u00a0securing the government complex \\u201cclearly demonstrates that the enemy is losing momentum as they steadily cede territory\\u201d in Iraq and Syria, said Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of U.S. Central Command, which is in charge of the fight against ISIS.Citing Gen. Ismail al-Mahlawi, head of military operations in Anbar, the\\u00a0Associated Press (AP) reported early Monday afternoon \\u201cthat Iraqi forces had only retaken the government complex and that parts of the city remained under IS control.\\u201dHe said ISIS jihadists still control 30 percent of the Iraqi city, adding that Iraqi forces do not fully control many districts abandoned by the militants.Nevertheless, USA Today quoted Abdul Ghani Al Assad, an\\u00a0Iraqi military commander, as saying that ISIS still held outlying districts of Ramadi, but the terrorists were now on the run.\\u201cDaesh fled to the eastern outskirts of the city,\\u201d reportedly said Al Assad, using the Arabic term for ISIL. \\u201cWe will chase them to end their evil totally.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 141298}"
