But he was not sweating it. \\u201cI don\\u2019t mind anything, except the Republican debates,\\u201d he said breezily.\\\",\\\"That may be because Mr. Schumacher, the filmmaker and screenwriter, has already weathered every possible entertainment industry storm.\\\",\\\"At 76, he has been responsible for hits (\\u201cThe Lost Boys,\\u201d \\u201cThe Client,\\u201d \\u201cBatman Forever\\u201d) and misses (\\u201cPhantom of the Opera,\\u201d the nipply batsuit in\\u201cBatman &amp; Robin\\u201d). When film offers began slipping, Mr. Schumacher was content to reboot with a young cast onstage. \\u201cNeighborhood 3,\\u201d which opens on Monday, is being performed by 17 members ofthe Bats, the Flea\\u2019s resident troupe of nonunion,unpaidactors.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI like working with superstars too, but I had a lot of luck in my movies with unknowns, so it\\u2019s fun to be in that again, where all their dreams and hopes are,\\u201d Mr. Schumacher said. \\u201cMaybe it keeps me young.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A svelte 6 foot 3, with his silver hair bobbed, Mr. Schumacher has the look, and the jewelry, of a California surfer (which he was), and the swagger and unfiltered mouth of a native New Yorker.\\\",\\\"He was raised in Long Island City, Queens, before migrating toStudio 54, and then West. (He started in Hollywood as a costume designer, wrote spec scripts that were actually produced, and moved behind the camera with \\u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Woman,\\u201d starring Lily Tomlin.) \\u201cGrowing up on the streets of New York, that\\u2019smy strength,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNeighborhood 3,\\u201d a dark comedy by the rising Los Angeles playwrightJennifer Haley, is only his second experience directing theater; the first was more than 25 years ago, in Chicago, awell-received productionof \\u201cSpeed-the-Plow\\u201d far outside the Loop.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI wanted Off-Off-Off,\\u201d Mr. Schumacher said of landing now at the Flea\\u2019s 74-seat space. \\u201cThis reminds me of some of the Chicago theaters \\u2014 it\\u2019s theater of, for and by the people. It\\u2019s very \\u2018Let\\u2019s put on a show!\\u2019\\u201d\\\",\\\"Carol Ostrow, the producing director of the 19-year-old Flea, said Mr. Schumacher exemplifies an aspect of its mission: \\u201cTo be a place where emerging actors take their place in the ecological system of theater, and where established professionals can come back and rediscover what it was about this business that hooked them.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI felt that any inexperience in terms of staging would be vastly compensated by what he did have in terms of his experience to offer a young company,\\u201d she added. \\u201cEvery day, they all learn from the master.\\u201d\\\",\\\"At a postpreview notes session last week, Mr. Schumacher sat surrounded by cast members in a semicircle, like a shepherd and his flock. He gave them notes on projecting and cracked jokes about J-Date. The show was written for a cast of four \\u2014 two teenage types and two parent types \\u2014 but at Ms. Ostrow\\u2019s behest, and with Ms. Haley\\u2019s approval, that swelled for the Bats, most of whom are in their 20s.\\\",\\\"Set in a cookie-cutter suburban subdivision, where the all-powerful Neighborhood Association keeps watch and teenagers are addicted to the zombie-killing, role-playing video game of the title, the play dramatizes the disconnect between generations. Toggling between the virtual and real worlds, families and neighbors engage in an increasingly volatile \\u2014 and bloody, yet funny \\u2014 standoff.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think the theatrical space is really perfect for telling stories about virtual reality,\\u201d Ms. Haley said, \\u201cbecause in a way it mimics the theatrical construct in which actors become avatars.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Haley, 44, has made a specialty of bringing technological themes to the stage. Her play \\u201cThe Nether,\\u201d about an alternate-reality future, was acritical hitfor theMCC Theaterthis year.\\\",\\\"\\u201cNeighborhood 3\\u201d actually goes further back, having debuted at the Humana Festival in Louisville, Ky., in 2008, tomixedreviews.\\\",\\\"It was Mr. Schumacher who brought it to the attention of the Flea, Ms. Ostrow said, and he asked Ms. Haley, whose work he had followed, for her permission to direct. She was keen, thinking that, after directing \\u201cLost Boys\\u201d and \\u201cSt. Elmo\\u2019s Fire,\\u201d he understood the young mind. \\u201cHe picked out his favorite lines, and they were always the ones with the darkest humor,\\u201d she said.\\\",\\\"Under the Flea\\u2019s recently installed artistic director,Niegel Smith, \\u201cNeighborhood 3\\u201d was to include a live-action game, developed by an outside company and played on the streets of the city, but it was scrapped because of logistical hurdles and lack of funding.\\\",\\\"Otherwise, Mr. Schumacher might have been the first in line to try it: He\\u2019s au courant enough to have gifted his many godchildren with the latest version of \\u201cCall of Duty.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He also may be the Kevin Bacon of interconnected glam 20th-century life. Richard Avedon photographed him when he was still studying design at Parsons. Dominick Dunne and Joan Didion got him his first job in Hollywood, as a costumer on an adaptation of Ms. Didion\\u2019s \\u201cPlay It as It Lays.\\u201d\\\",\\\"After he worked on costumes for \\u201cSleeper,\\u201d Woody Allen encouraged him to write. \\u201cHe said, \\u2018But you must finish, and someone has to read it\\u2019\\u201d \\u2014 great advice, Mr. Schumacher recalled.\\\",\\\"He has worked with Diana Ross, lunched with Edith Head and shared a story involving George Cukor, Mae West and Greta Garbo (the punch line of course, was West\\u2019s).\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019ve had a really long run, longer than some people that I think are far more talented than I am,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure, the way I lived my life, that I knew I would ever make it to 40.\\u201d (He has been sober since age 52.) \\u201cAnd so I have no complaints.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Still, his last Hollywood feature,\\u201cTrespass,\\u201dearned barely $24,000 at the domestic box office in 2011, despite starring Nicole Kidman and Nicolas Cage. By then, Mr. Schumacher had moved back to New York. Though he was set financially, retirement was not an option. \\u201cI have to work,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been working since I\\u2019m 9. I started delivering meat for the butcher.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He directed a few episodes of the Netflix series \\u201cHouse of Cards,\\u201d at the request of his longtime friend David Fincher, and asked an agent at Creative Artists Agency to steer him toward theater.\\\",\\\"Mr. Schumacher was first attached to \\u201cThe Parisian Woman,\\u201d a work that Beau Willimon, the \\u201cHouse of Cards\\u201d creator, adapted from a 19th-century French play. But despite interest from Ellen Barkin, it never materialized as a project for Mr. Schumacher. (With another director, it played in 2013 at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, Calif.)\\\",\\\"The Flea has been an education, he said. And though he still occasionally says \\u201coff screen\\u201d when he means \\u201coffstage,\\u201d Ms. Ostrow said he was a quick study. \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t understand what tech was,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhen I explained it to him, he said, \\u2018Oh, you mean every day on a movie set?\\u2019\\u201d\\\",\\\"He spends free time visiting friends and with his boyfriend of four and a half years, a former Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model.\\\",\\\"Is he younger? \\u201cYes!\\u201d Mr. Schumacher replied with a quick smile. \\u201cBut everyone is younger than me.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
