In addition, we hope to receive funds currently in the omnibus appropriations bill that would allow us to do additional hiring.The Domestic Policy Council executive order reflects the fact that ONAP is part of the DPC, and as a result, the head of the office automatically participates on the Council. Those listed in the executive order are departments, agencies and White House offices not part of the DPC.Thank you for your interestIt remains unclear whether this represents a change in the status of the head of the office, and Obama's press shop didn't respond to Gerstein's question on\\u00a0 the subject last night.\", \"article_id\": 1947}"
