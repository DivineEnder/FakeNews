"{\"title\": \"Assad's Wife Blames Deaths of Syrian Children on Western Powers\", \"content\": \"As RT.com makes clear, probably inadvertently, Rossiya led Asma Assad into these accusations by asking loaded questions about why some humanitarian tragedies in Syria receive more international news coverage than others.She then groused about the saturation coverage given to the death of Aylan Kurdi, the Syrian refugee whose drowned body became a global media symbol of the refugee crisis, and the injured boy\\u00a0Omran Daqneesh, who has become the face of civilian suffering in Aleppo.Asma Assad tried to portray her husband\\u2019s regime as the guardian of all Syrian children:The western media decided to focus on these tragedies because it suited their media agenda. It is actually the West dividing our children in this conflict according to the political beliefs of their parents. Aylan was a Syrian child irrespective of what his parents believed as was Omran and the other innocent children in the Zara village massacre.These are all children, they are all innocent children and they are all a loss to Syria irrespective of which side of the conflict we support. And as a Syrian, I am personally saddened by the loss of every single child, whether it is Aylan or Omran or the many, many others, whose names did not reach western headlines.\\u201cUltimately, humanitarian aid should not be determined by geography, political orientation or religious beliefs. It cannot be allowed to be driven by political agendas,\\u201d she added.The BBC reports that Asma Assad claimed to have been offered political asylum by an unnamed country in the interview, but she refused because she wanted to remain by her husband\\u2019s side. She accused those who offered her asylum of attempting to undermine the Assad presidency:Yes I was offered the opportunity to leave Syria or rather to run from Syria. These offers included guarantees of safety and protection for my children and even financial security.It doesn\\u2019t take a genius to know what these people were really after. It was a deliberate attempt to shatter people\\u2019s confidence in their president.The Syrian First Lady, who was a London-born investment banker before marrying Bashar Assad in 2000, made a point of thanking Russia for its \\u201cnoble efforts\\u201d in support of her husband\\u2019s regime.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 156747}"
