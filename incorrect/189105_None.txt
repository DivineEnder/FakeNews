"{\"title\": \"Michael Moore's Implosion Concludes With Some 'Final Thoughts' On Bin Laden\", \"content\": \"No need to editorialize here. We\\u2019ll just let the man\\u2019s  words, historical illiteracy and moral equivalency speak for itself. It took some work, but we were able to narrow down our list of The Stupid to 10. For  context\\u2019s sake, Michael Moore\\u2019s  piece can be read in full here.\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, for this evening\\u2019s entertainment, quotes from Mr. Michael Moore:\\n\\n2. There was no bloodlust euphoria on the day Timothy McVeigh was executed. We were silent. The families of the Oklahoma City dead were silent, relieved. What is the difference between McVeigh and bin Laden, other than the number they slaughtered? I wonder.3. [T]he Taliban are Afghan citizens, not an invading force, and, for better or worse, they seem to enjoy the support of many of the common people throughout Afghanistan.\\n\\n5. I know a lot of people see no need for a trial for these bad guys (just hang \\u2019em from the nearest tree!), and think trials are for sissies. \\u201cThey\\u2019re guilty, off with their heads!\\u201d Well, you see, that is the exact description of the Taliban/al Qaeda/Nazi justice system.6. [Osama] was a multimillionaire crime boss (using religion as his cover)[.] \\u2026  He had people killed under the guise of religion, and not many in the media bothered to explain that every time Osama referenced Islam, he wasn\\u2019t really quoting Islam. Just because Osama said he was a \\u201cMuslim\\u201d didn\\u2019t make it so.7. Yet, we began to fear Muslims and round them up.8. We profiled people from Muslim nations at airports. We didn\\u2019t profile multi-millionaires (in fact, they now have their own fast-track line to easily get through security, an oddity considering every murderer on 9/11 flew in first class).9. We did exactly what bin Laden said he wanted us to do: Give up our freedoms (like the freedom to be assumed innocent until proven guilty), engage our military in Muslim countries so that we will be hated by Muslims, and wipe ourselves out financially in doing so.10. A killer of 4,000 (counting the African embassies and USS Cole bombings) got double-tapped in his pajamas. Assuming it was possible to take him alive, I think his victims, the future, and the restoration of the American Way deserved better. That\\u2019s all I\\u2019m saying.No doubt, bin Laden\\u2019s victims appreciate Mr. Moore speaking on their behalf.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 189105}"
