"{\"title\": \"Florida Passes Race-based Student Goals\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"By 2018, they want 90% of Asian students, 88% white students, 81% Hispanics and 74% black students to read at or above grade level. They want 92% Asian, 86% whites, 80% Hispanics, and 74% blacks to be proficient in math. \\u201cTo expect less from one demographic and more from another is just a little off-base,\\u201d said Juan Lopez, magnet coordinator at John F. Kennedy Middle School. \\u201cOur kids, although they come from different socioeconomic backgrounds, they still have the ability to learn,\\u201d Lopez said. \\u201cTo dumb down the expectations for one group, that seems a little unfair.\\u201dA little off-base? A little unfair? Basically the board is telling blacks they will never be as smart as anyone else so why even bother trying. State Board of Education Chairwoman Kathleen Shanahan said they set very high goal for all students in Florida.No, they did not. The board set high expectations for Asians and told whites, Hispanics, and blacks they\\u2019ll never be as smart as their Asian counterparts. The board told Asians the stereotypes about them being excellent in school are true. They play into the stereotype Asians excel at academics more than other races and that poor black students don\\u2019t do as well as others. It is insulting to play into stereotypes instead of inspiring them to be the very best. Just because they are poor doesn\\u2019t mean they can\\u2019t come out on top.\\u00a0This law is pure racism. It\\u2019s true that everyone doesn\\u2019t learn the same way, but that doesn\\u2019t give the board of education an excuse to separate students by race. The goals should be the same for every child and every child should aim to be at 100% in reading and math and all the other subjects.\\u00a0Every child should be pushed to be their very best no matter their race or living conditions.\\u00a0Palm Beach County School Board vice-chairwoman Debra Robinson is disgusted by this law and received a lot of complaints from Hispanic and black parents. Hopefully they\\u2019ll raise enough of a fuss to have this racist law overturned.\\n\", \"article_id\": 226356}"
