"{\"content\": \"They\\u2019ve got one message and that is, we\\u2019re going to make sure that we cut people\\u2019s taxes even more \\u2013 so that by every objective measure our deficit is worse and we will slash government investments that have made this country great, not because it\\u2019s going to balance the budget, but because it\\u2019s driven by our ideological vision about how government should be.\\u00a0 That\\u2019s their agenda, pure and simple.Obviously the takeaway line here is that \\u201cgovernment investments \\u2026 have made this country great.\\u201d That is insipid. The American people and their hard work, perseverance, and creativity make this country great\\u2013not bureaucrats in Washington spending huge sums of money in order to generate mediocre results. \\u00a0In another speech on Friday, Obama suggested that Republicans suffered from \\u201cmadness\\u201d for opposing him.The notion that cutting taxes creates deficits \\u2013 not his wildly out-of-control spending, the largest single spending spree in the history of mankind \\u2013 is pure Obama, suggesting that all money and rights source back to the government, not the people. The idea that Obama is suddenly a budget-balancer is hilarious, especially when you recognize that by not cutting spending, the only way to balance the budget is to ratchet up taxes dramatically.But this speech is going to be President Obama\\u2019s blueprint for the election cycle. And there\\u2019s more to it than his simple Big Government view of politics.He ticked off his list of accomplishments in tending to \\u201ca set of challenges that had been building up for decades.\\u201d What are those accomplishments? Ending \\u201cdon\\u2019t ask, don\\u2019t tell\\u201d \\u2013 hardly a landmark proposition, considering that President Clinton instituted it in the first place. Signing the Lilly Ledbetter Act, a terrible piece of legislation that extends the statute of limitations indefinitely for discrimination lawsuits \\u2013 basically, a sop to the trial lawyers. Investment \\u201cin clean energy\\u201d \\u2013 that\\u2019s companies like Solyndra. And, of course, Obamacare, which is blatantly unconstitutional and puts our entire economy on the verge of bankruptcy. So there\\u2019s that.The speech goes on with his litany of \\u201caccomplishments\\u201d that aren\\u2019t actually accomplishments \\u2013 ending American involvement in Iraq and handing power over to the Iranians; chaos in Afghanistan; reading terrorists Miranda rights that they shouldn\\u2019t have. Lies, half-truths, and nonsense masquerading as a winning record. And he spells out further goals: moving beyond fossil fuels (how?), investing in infrastructure (remember those non-existent shovel-ready projects?), and reforming immigration (what do you suggest?). So if we\\u2019re interested, four more years of incompetent world-changing are just around the corner.The speech also featured Obama\\u2019s capitalization on the personal popularity of his wife, Michelle, who has become one of his most successful fundraising tools. It featured an insane amount of whining, too. There\\u2019s his self-proclaimed martyrdom: So there\\u2019s a lot at stake.\\u00a0 But the good news is, as I travel around the country, part of what sustained me each and every day \\u2013 people sometimes ask, boy, you\\u2019re working pretty long hours and people are calling you pretty nasty names, and how do you put up with all that?\\u00a0 How many people truly ask President Obama how he works so hard and gets called names? And how many presidents have whined about it in public?And the whining didn\\u2019t stop there. We got President Obama\\u2019s \\u201cBlame Bush Without Mentioning Him\\u201d routine:We\\u2019ve gone through a tough three years, this country \\u2013 as tough as any in our lifetime.\\u00a0 The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\\u00a0 The economic aftermath that left millions without work.\\u00a0 A collapsed housing market.\\u00a0 It\\u2019s hard to remember sometimes how perilous things were when I was sworn in.\\u00a0 The month I was sworn into office, we lost 800,000 jobs in that month alone.\\u00a0 We had lost almost 4 million in the months before I took office.\\u00a0 And then we would just keep on shedding jobs for the first few months that I was sworn in.\\u00a0 The banks were locked up, so even blue-chip companies couldn\\u2019t get credit.\\u00a0 People, I think, genuinely thought that you might see a world financial meltdown.\\u00a0 And nobody exactly knew where the bottom was.\\u00a0 The stock market, by the way, was about half of what it is today.Notice how he blames Bush for job losses on his own watch. Subtle.His last line is a killer, though:If you are just as determined, and you\\u2019re willing to work just as hard as we did four years ago, then we\\u2019re going to win.\\u00a0 And more importantly, we\\u2019re going to make sure that this country is everything that it deserves to be.What does that even mean? What do we deserve to be? For Obama, the answer is obvious: we deserve to be bankrupt. Which means great. Or something.\\n\", \"article_id\": 222951, \"title\": \"Obama: Government Spending 'Made This Country Great'\", \"source_id\": 2}"
