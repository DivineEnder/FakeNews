Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate set out to rebuild the crumbling image of the world\\u2019s greatest deliberative body, they started from the ground up.\\\",\\\"Thenew institute, which will be dedicated on Monday to the memory of the senator who spent nearly 50 years thundering from the Senate floor, has as its centerpiece a full-scale replica of the chamber, a re-creation startlingly authentic even to those who have spent countless hours in the real thing.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI walked in there and I actually got a chill,\\u201d said former Senator Trent Lott, the Mississippi Republican, who sits on the center\\u2019s board. \\u201cI thought, \\u2018I have been here before.\\u2019\\u00a0\\u201d\\\",\\\"President Obama, the Kennedy family and former colleagues are scheduled to be on hand for ceremonies celebrating both Senator Kennedy and the center\\u2019s vision: to remind the public that an institution that today is known more forfilibustersand dysfunction than bold leadership and stirring debate can again become a venue for finding national consensus.\\\",\\\"To drive that point home, the $78.4 million combination museum and civics classroom will allow visitors to serve as senators in training in a Hollywood-ready facsimile of a setting that Mr. Kennedy saw as hallowed ground able to stir senators to overcome their political impulses to accomplish big things.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe believed in the majesty of the place,\\u201d said his widow, Victoria Reggie Kennedy. She, along with other family members, has been a moving force behind the institute, which Mr. Kennedy had a major role in planning before he died in 2009.\\\",\\\"The notion for the institute, adjacent to his brother\\u2019s presidential library, originated as Mr. Kennedy was pondering a possible post-Senate life. At a family birthday dinner in 2002, Edwin Schlossberg, a designer who is married to Caroline Kennedy, the senator\\u2019s niece, presented him with a rough drawing and an idea for a facility that would represent more of a political learning experience than simply an overview of the Senate.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSenator Kennedy was so in love with being in the Senate,\\u201d Mr. Schlossberg said. He said his concept was to build a center that would not just \\u201cbe a place to learn about the Senate but to learn about being in the Senate.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The idea of reproducing the chamber took hold from there, and it became integral to the institute, which received significant support from Mr. Kennedy\\u2019s colleagues in Congress through $38 million in public funding over the years.\\\",\\\"Built from the results of a three-dimensional architectural survey of the actual chamber, the institute\\u2019s version is not an exact replica. The rostrum occupied by the presiding officer is not raised in order to comply with accessibility standards, there is a prominent video screen and there are no busts of the vice presidents who have presided, to name a few variations.\\\",\\\"But from many angles on the floor and from the visitors\\u2019 and media galleries, those differences virtually disappear, aided by the matching color scheme and carpeting, the familiar assembly of 100 specially made desks, the characteristic cloakroom and entry doors, the (faux) marbling and the padded staff benches lining the back walls. A designated desk to be filled with candy awaits just as in the actual Senate. The institute has even recorded the hubbub of the Senate voting, with calls for the Senate to be in order, to play for verisimilitude.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt is an audacious idea,\\u201d said Bill R. DeWalt, executive vice president of the institute, about the re-creation. \\u201cBut it works.\\u201d\\\",\\\"It may work particularly well on Monday when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the president of the Senate, presides over the dedication of the chamber with current senators on the floor \\u2014 paired with college students from around the country.\\\",\\\"The institute also houses a re-creation of Mr. Kennedy\\u2019s office in the Senate\\u2019s Russell Building, complete with family photos and the tennis balls left for his ever-present Portuguese water dogs.\\\",\\\"The chamber will be the setting for what the institute is calling immersion modules. In two-hour simulations, specially trained staff will lead up to 100 middle and high school students through their swearing in, hearings, legislative negotiations, debate and voting. The rules provide for a filibuster but one that, in this chamber, is limited.\\\",\\\"Two case studies on immigration and the Compromise of 1850 have been developed, and staff said a third on thePatriot Actwas being assembled with the assistance of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, through the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville. The idea is to show what goes into drafting legislation and the trade-offs required to get an outcome.\\\",\\\"Mrs. Kennedy and other institute officials said that almost without exception in trial runs, restless students had immediately become serious upon entering the chamber and enthusiastically participated to a degree surprising to some of their teachers.\\\",\\\"And while their parents might have become jaded about the abilities of Congress, members of the institute\\u2019s staff said it was not too late for younger Americans to learn how to tolerate an opposing point of view or how a compromise can be superior to solutions that do not accommodate competing outlooks.\\\",\\\"Mr. Kennedy\\u2019s former colleagues say that is the legacy of the Massachusetts Democrat, who no doubt would have had something interesting to say about the Senate gridlock of recent years. They note that Mr. Kennedy, always one of the most liberal members of the Senate, was able to find a way to create landmark legislation with Republicans on such difficult topics as immigration, health care and education \\u2014 a skill that seems almost lost in Congress today.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere wasn\\u2019t anybody who felt more strongly about issues,\\u201d said former Senator Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, a Democrat and another member of the institute\\u2019s board who served with Mr. Kennedy. \\u201cHe came to the floor to speak powerfully and emotionally in the strongest terms he could use to express himself. Having done that, he would reach out to the people on the other side.\\\",\\\"\\u201cA lot of people take the first part ofTed Kennedyand go to the floor and express their strong views, but the second part is lacking,\\u201d Mr. Daschle said. \\u201cTed Kennedy was remarkable in his ability to reach out to the most conservative people to find common ground.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
