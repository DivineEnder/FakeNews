"{\"article_id\": 346480, \"title\": \"De Blasio Shifts Away From His Re-election Message of \\u2018One City\\u2019\", \"content\": \"{\\\"The central message of MayorBill de Blasio\\u2019s re-election pitch appeared clear, even early in his administration: After a winning 2013 campaign that deplored the \\u201ctale of two cities,\\u201d the mayor\\u2019s bid for a second term would be founded on his mission to create \\u201cone city\\u201d for all New Yorkers.\\\",\\\"Words of unity adorned banners placed behind Mr. de Blasio at public events and the official names on his agenda: a plan for the city\\u2019s future titled OneNYC; a policing strategy named One City, Safe and Fair Everywhere; and a nonprofit formed to buttress the mayoral agenda, the Campaign for One New York.\\\",\\\"But in recent months, as overlapping investigationshave swamped his administration, the notion that Mr. de Blasio has brought about a unified city \\u2014 a theme that mayoral advisers believed could lure New Yorkers into the fold who voted against him last time \\u2014 appears to have all but vanished as an argument for his re-election in 2017.\\\",\\\"While the \\u201cone city\\u201d banners remain, the inquiries into Mr. de Blasio and his aides have sapped much of the mayor\\u2019s ability to court new voters at the moment, some of his advisers believe, especially skeptical whites who have mostly shunned the mayor\\u2019s agenda.\\\",\\\"They also have given new hope to potential challengers in 2017: Bradley Tusk, a former close adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the architect of Uber\\u2019s successful bid to oppose Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s regulatory efforts, is vowing to organize aggressively in support of the mayor\\u2019s defeat in a Democratic primary.\\\",\\\"The shifting political landscape has forced Mr. de Blasio to retool his strategy: His aides said the new game plan was to highlight the mayor\\u2019s accomplishments, portray him as an able manager of its day-to-day and long-term needs, and shore up support among the core constituencies that have long backed him, including labor unions and liberal activists.\\\",\\\"Surrogates have blasted out a litany of mayoral achievements by email, on Twitter and in op-eds articles. Aides have pointed to supportive words from a small number of voices rising to defend the mayor.\\\",\\\"Returning to the \\u201ctwo cities\\u201d theme, the mayor has fashioned an array of boogeymen to rail against, from \\u201cbillionaire media owners\\u201d and hedge fund managers to state investigatory agencies and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has been increasinglywilling to punch backpublicly. It is a refrain that the mayor has underscored since a recent strategy discussion in which he embraced the idea, one adviser said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe said we would take on the tale of two cities,\\u201d Mr. de Blasio told the crowdat his birthday fund-raiserlast month. \\u201cBut those who believe the tale of two cities is somehow ordained, they will fight to preserve it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Over the next month, Mr. de Blasio is expected to hold about a dozen additional low-dollar campaign fund-raisers, ranging in size from dozens of attendees to several hundred, according to a campaign adviser, with hosts including State Assemblyman Luis R. Sep\\u00falveda of the Bronx and the City Council members Daniel Dromm, Ydanis Rodriguez and Helen Rosenthal.\\\",\\\"Most of the aides and advisers interviewed about the mayor\\u2019s approach spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations, plans and the effect of investigations and negative headlines on the outlook for 2017.\\\",\\\"But the fear of powerful opponents is not unfounded. Mr. de Blasio has faced stiff resistance to his agenda \\u2014 and millions spent on negative television ads \\u2014 from well-funded antagonists includingcharter schooladvocates, Uber and the city\\u2019s largest police unions.\\\",\\\"Mr. Tusk, who would have run a Bloomberg presidential campaign had it gone forward, said his consulting firm, Tusk Holdings, dropped Mr. Bloomberg as a client last month in order for Mr. Tusk to publicly pursue efforts to unseat Mr. de Blasio, starting with a private poll of Democratic primary voters that began on Wednesday.\\\",\\\"He unveiled a new website on Monday \\u2014NYCDeservesBetter.com\\u2014 along with a podcast and a tipsheet for potential candidates, paid for with his own money, he said. (His firm is also working for the Patrolman\\u2019s Benevolent Association, which is negotiating its contract and running television ads thatgo after the mayor.)\\\",\\\"\\u201cI hate the way the city is being run right now,\\u201d Mr. Tusk, 42, said in an interview. \\u201cEverything is focused on politics, everything is focused on ideology.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Tusk said he would seek to expand turnout in the Democratic primary, which Mr. de Blasio won with roughly 280,000 of 690,000 ballots cast in 2013, out of around three million registered Democrats. Mr. Tusk planned to court younger New Yorkers with the sorts of sharing apps and services that have become ubiquitous in many of their lives, including Airbnb, Uber and the restaurant delivery service Seamless. (None of the companies have yet been approached by Mr. Tusk about participating in a get-out-the-vote campaign, though he said he had discussed the idea with Uber at the national level when Mr. Bloomberg was mulling his presidential run.)\\\",\\\"The poll, he said, would lay the groundwork for an as-yet-unnamed challenger. Among those included in the poll were a few familiar potential candidates \\u2014 the public advocate, Letitia James; the comptroller, Scott M. Stringer; Representative Hakeem Jeffries \\u2014 and some unusual ones like the Rev. Al Sharpton, the former police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough.\\\",\\\"Another potential candidate, Paul J. Massey Jr., a real estate developer who has said he is mulling a Republican run for mayor, closed anonprofit issue advocacy grouphe formed this year, 1NY Together, before it ever got off the ground \\u2014 an indication of the shifting attitudes toward the nonprofit model that Mr. de Blasio had embraced. (Citing the completion of its work, Mr. de Blasio has said the Campaign for One New York has also stopped operations.)\\\",\\\"\\u201cToo many 501(c)(4)\\u2019s have crossed the legal line, and I wouldn\\u2019t want to be mentioned in the same sentence with any of them,\\u201d he said, referring to the section of the tax code that allows for their creation.\\\",\\\"Faced with the opposition, the mayor\\u2019s strategy has been threefold, aides said: Stay focused on the job; keep in constant communication with supporters and allies; and get the message out on the radio, in town-hall-style meetings and through community events.\\\",\\\"In recent weeks, council members have been encouraged by the mayor\\u2019s office to post messages on Twitter vowing to \\u201c#protectprogress\\u201d; eight of 51 had done so by Friday. Unions, too, were pressed to express support.\\\",\\\"\\u201cScreaming headlines have jumped ahead of the appropriate legal scrutiny now taking place,\\u201d Henry Garrido, the executive director of District Council 37, the city\\u2019s largest union of municipal workers, wrote in an email to his members on May 26. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s important during this challenging time to take stock of the accomplishments of the past two and a half years.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Sharpton, who defended Mr. de Blasio ina speech last month, said no one had asked him to do so. \\u201cMy concern was protecting some of the initiatives,\\u201d he said, adding, of the investigations into Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s team, that \\u201cthere\\u2019s no there there yet.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI\\u2019m not saying there won\\u2019t be,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s no there yet.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Phil Walzak, a top adviser to Mr. de Blasio, said the mayor never abandoned his goal of a more unified city and pointed to \\u201cone-city moments\\u201d such as a news conference last month in which business leaders expressed support for mayoral control of city schools, the Police Department\\u2019s low crime numbers and the administration\\u2019s focus on improving homeless services.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe are in a snapshot in time,\\u201d Mr. Walzak said. By the start of the 2017 election campaign, he said, \\u201cthe atmosphere and climate that we\\u2019re going to be operating in will be fundamentally different because I believe that our team has acted appropriately and we\\u2019ll be vindicated.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cOutside of all of these atmospherics,\\u201d he continued, \\u201cthe story we have to tell is very powerful.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
