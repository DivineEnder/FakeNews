"{\"title\": \"Islamist Murders Jews, Media Rushes to Defend Islamism\", \"content\": \"As it turned out, however, the gunman had nothing to do with neo-Nazism or conservatism; he was an al-Qaeda associated Islamic radical who repeatedly called the news channel France 24 to announce that \\u201chis crimes were revenge attacks for Palestinian deaths.\\u201dFor those who live in the real world, this news is anything but surprising. Islamist radicals, including members of al-Qaeda, have routinely attacked Jews all over the world, from the Chabad of Mumbai to the attempted killings of Israeli diplomats in India and Georgia to the murder of Jews at the El-Al counter of the Los Angeles International Airport.Yet the media wouldn\\u2019t draw that conclusion. Instead, they went into full-on Islam whitewashing, citing the usual liberal bromide that poverty causes Islamists to murder Jews. The Telegraph\\u2019s Ed West wrote: \\u201cIslam is not to blame for the Toulouse killings \\u2026 It is not religion that turns some young Muslim men in the West violent, but the sense of alienation and frustration that inevitably comes from being a second-generation immigrant.\\u201d Meanwhile, Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad, shedding crocodile tears, said, even as the rockets continue to fall from Gaza, \\u201cIt is time for these criminals to stop marketing their terrorist acts in the name of Palestine \\u2026\\u201dCan the murders in Toulose be separated from the murders of the Chabad rabbi and his pregnant wife in Mumbai? Can they be separated from the butchery of Daniel Pearl and Nicholas Berg? Of course not. But the media will do its darndest to try. Islamism is never the enemy; capitalism and white racism are. So long as the media continues to cover for the world\\u2019s Islamists in the name of tolerance and multiculturalism, they will be aiding and abetting murder and terror against Jews across the globe.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 217033}"
