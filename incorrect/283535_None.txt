"{\"article_id\": 283535, \"title\": \"Blue State Blues: Universities and the 'Chicago Way'\", \"content\": \"Ten years ago, my dad was the whistleblower in a case that blew open the corruption in the organ transplant system in Chicago. Three hospitals\\u2013all run by universities\\u2013were accused of gaming the transplant list, lying about how sick their own patients were to move them to the top. They cheated without regard to the lives that were placed at risk at other hospitals\\u2013people near death, in some cases. They betrayed the public trust.My father had fought a quiet battle against corruption for years. As former head of the Regional Organ Bank of Illinois, he had helped devise the rules, after all. He took his concerns about cheating at his own hospital, the University of Illinois at Chicago\\u2013a public institution\\u2013straight to the top of the academy. The university listened and did nothing\\u2013that is, nothing but retaliate against my father for trying to stop a terrible moral wrong.In the end, he was vindicated. \\u201cA man of principle,\\u201d the\\u00a0Chicago Tribune\\u00a0declared.\\u00a0As reporter Nara Schoenberg wrote: \\u201cAccording to Pollak\\u2019s suit and the government, three of the city\\u2019s top medical centers\\u2013the University of Illinois Hospital, Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the University of Chicago Hospitals\\u2013improperly diagnosed and hospitalized patients in the 1990s to move them up on the liver transplant waiting list.You can see why the story of Dr.\\u00a0Robert Pedowitz, former chair of UCLA\\u2019s orthopedic surgery department, struck a chord with my father. In 2012, Chad Terhune of the\\u00a0Los Angeles Times\\u00a0wrote, \\u201cthe surgeon sued UCLA, the UC regents, fellow surgeons and senior university officials, alleging they failed to act on his complaints about widespread conflicts of interest and later retaliated against him for speaking up.\\u201dAll of that is deeply familiar. In my father\\u2019s case, Schoenberg wrote, the dean of the medical school \\u201csent Pollak a disciplinary letter accusing him of \\u2018virtual insubordination,\\u2019 an accusation that arose, in part, from Pollak\\u2019s refusal to conduct the liver program in the \\u2018Chicago Way,\\u2019 the lawsuit says.\\u201d (Yes\\u2013that same \\u201cChicago Way\\u201d so beloved of the Obama administration, one that satraps like David Axelrod\\u00a0wear like a badge of honor.)\\u201cPollak continued raising objections for another year or so, until April 1998, when he was removed from his post as chief of the transplant division\\u2026.In the aftermath of Pollak\\u2019s demotion, all 65 surgery residents signed a letter \\u2018imploring\\u2019 University of Illinois President James Stukel to reinstate him. The letter described him as \\u2018one of the most dedicated, moral and honest mentors we have.'\\u201d\\u00a0Likewise, apparently, in Pedowitz\\u2019s case at UCLA.As Terhune writes: \\u201cAs department chairman, Pedowitz testified, he became concerned about colleagues who had financial ties to medical-device makers or other companies that could unduly influence their care of patients or taint important medical research.\\u00a0He also alleged that UCLA looked the other way because the university stood to benefit financially from the success of medical products or drugs developed by its doctors.\\u201dIn an interview with the\\u00a0Times, Dr. Pedowitz warned:\\u00a0\\u201cThese are serious issues that patients should be worried about\\u2026 These problems exist in the broader medical system and they are not restricted to UCLA.\\u201d He could have added: these problems exist in universities, where administrators think they are immune from the kind of accountability that private companies, and to a far lesser extent government agencies, eventually have to face.At Harvard, my alma mater, a student recently took to the pages of the Harvard\\u00a0Crimson\\u00a0to\\u00a0express\\u00a0her deep frustration at the university\\u2019s failure to respond appropriately to complaints about sexual assault\\u2013and in her own case in particular. I might have chalked it up to the usual absurdity and narcissism of campus sexual politics, had I not had classmates for whom sexual assault on campus had been a very real, debilitating reality.To the credit of Harvard president Drew G. Faust, the university is\\u2013finally\\u2013taking the student\\u2019s concerns quite seriously. But there are other students\\u2013those facing accusation of assault and far lesser violations\\u2013who have no real due process rights within the university\\u2019s medieval internal justice system. The Obama administration has, unfortunately,\\u00a0weighed in\\u00a0to reinforce the universities\\u2019 absurd and often unjust prejudice against defendants.Universities must enjoy the protections of academic freedom (though they are more inclined to conformity, as Azusa Pacific\\u2019s recent decision to \\u201cdisinvite\\u201d Professor Charles Murray reminds us). Yet they ought not exist as a sphere apart from principles of transparency, accountability and fairness. The \\u201cChicago Way\\u201d is not just an ethic of the street, but also the ivory tower. It is time to confront the political patrons of such academic corruption.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
