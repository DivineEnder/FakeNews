The attack is considered one of the most brutal in the Jewish state\\u2019s history.Kuntar led a group of four Palestine Liberation Front terrorists who entered Israel by boat from Lebanon on April 22, 1979. They first killed a policeman, Eliyahu Shahar, who apparently discovered the breach. They divided into two groups. One group, led by Kuntar, broke into the home of the Haran family just before police reinforcements arrived.Kuntar ran to a nearby beach, taking 31-year-old Danny Haran as a hostage as well as his four-year-old daughter, Einat.\\u00a0\\u00a0Danny\\u2019s wife, Smadar, hid with her two-year-old daughter, Yael, in a crawlspace above the bedroom.\\u00a0\\u00a0Smadar accidentally suffocated Yael to death while trying to quiet her daughter\\u2019s screams.Newsweek called the attack \\u201cso sickening they give pause even to some of Israel\\u2019s enemies.\\u201dOn the beach, Kuntar shot Danny in front of his daughter and then drowned him in the sea to make sure he was dead.
