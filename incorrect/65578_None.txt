"{\"article_id\": 65578, \"title\": \"The sincerest form of negative advertising?\", \"source_id\": 1, \"content\": \"Republicans are drawing on an unlikely source of inspiration as they pummel President Obama over his comment that the private sector economy is \\\"fine.\\\"Consider, if you will, the similarity between Obama's 2008 ad targeting John McCain's most infamous gaffe -- \\\"the fundamentals of our economy are strong\\\" -- and the web video put out this afternoon. (As I'm writing this, I see that Obama has already backpedaled on his comment in a subsequent White House event.))The context of the comments and the political mood are different, but the kicker is the same: \\\"How can [McCain/Obama] fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?\\\" And this is only what the RNC could put together on rush notice.\"}"
