That is up from an estimate of 145% made this past January.\\u201cSuch high and rising debt would have serious budgetary and economic consequences,\\u201d the agency warned.The increase reflects higher costs for health-care programs and Social Security, the result of an aging population, and higher interest payments on the government\\u2019s debts. CBO also lowered its projections for GDP growth over the next 30 years\\u2014in part because of slower productivity growth\\u2014which boosted the estimates of debt as a share of GDP.The report\\u2019s estimates are based on the assumption that current laws remain generally unchanged, and that potential GDP grows 1.9% on average each year through 2047, significantly lower than the 2.9% average over the previous 50 years.Lower interest rates are expected to soften the impact of higher deficits and slower economic growth by effectively offsetting the costs to the federal government. The latest CBO estimates envision the 10-year Treasury rate, after inflation, reaching 1.5% over the long term, down from estimates of 1.9% last year and 2.2% in 2015.Net interest costs are expected to average 2.1% of GDP over the coming decade, Thursday\\u2019s report showed, down from 2.5% last year. Despite the downward revision, however, those costs are expected to triple as a share of total federal spending over the next 30 years, from 7% today to 21% by 2047, as interest rates rise.The Federal Reserve started lifting short-term interest rates in December 2015 after keeping them pinned near zero for nearly a decade. Thursday\\u2019s CBO report assumes two Fed rate increases in 2017, including one earlier this month, and two increases in 2018.CBO also significantly lowered its projections for immigration, mainly because of an apparent slowdown in unauthorized immigration in recent years, the agency said.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.comAppeared in the Mar. 31, 2017, print edition as 'National Debt Is Projected To Nearly Double in 30 Years.'\", \"source_id\": 22245}"
