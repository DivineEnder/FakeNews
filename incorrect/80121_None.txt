"{\"title\": \"Hillary to Obama: Let's hug it out\", \"content\": \"Hillary Clinton called President Barack Obama on Tuesday to \\u201cmake sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him\\u201d when she recently discussed her views on foreign policy in an interview with The Atlantic, according to a statement from a Clinton spokesman.The statement comes amid tension between the Clinton and Obama camps in the wake of the interview. It also comes as Obama and Clinton, his former secretary of state, are due to cross paths at a social gathering Wednesday night in Martha\\u2019s Vineyard.In the interview, Clinton dismissed the Obama administration\\u2019s self-described foreign policy principle of \\u201cDon\\u2019t do stupid stuff.\\u201d And while she also praised Obama several times, Clinton nonetheless called his decision not to assist Syrian rebels early on a \\u201cfailure.\\u201d( Also on POLITICO: Obama calls Syria critique 'horsesh\\u2014')Earlier Tuesday, longtime top Obama aide David Axelrod took a swipe at Clinton on Twitter, writing: \\u201cJust to clarify: \\u2018Don\\u2019t do stupid stuff\\u2019 means stuff like occupying Iraq in the first place, which was a tragically bad decision.\\u201dThe statement from Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill noted that although Obama and Clinton have had disagreements, she has discussed these differences publicly before, including in her memoir, \\u201cHard Choices.\\u201d\\u201cSecretary Clinton was proud to serve with President Obama, she was proud to be his partner in the project of restoring American leadership and advancing America\\u2019s interests and values in a fast changing world,\\u201d said the statement, shared with POLITICO. \\u201cShe continues to share his deep commitment to a smart and principled foreign policy that uses all the tools at our disposal to achieve our goals. Earlier today, the secretary called President Obama to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership.It continued: \\u201cSecretary Clinton has at every step of the way touted the significant achievements of his presidency, which she is honored to have been part of as his secretary of state. While they\\u2019ve had honest differences on some issues, including aspects of the wicked challenge Syria presents, she has explained those differences in her book and at many points since then. Some are now choosing to hype those differences but they do not eclipse their broad agreement on most issues. Like any two friends who have to deal with the public eye, she looks forward to hugging it out when ... they see each other tomorrow night.\\u201d( Also on POLITICO: Obama's inconsistent truth)Clinton has always been more of a hawk than Obama; her vote in favor of authorizing the use of force in Iraq haunted her on in the Democratic primary against Obama when they were running for president in 2008, and she only recently, in her book, has said she was wrong to vote that way.Now pondering a 2016 White House run, she spoke at length on a variety of foreign policy issues with The Atlantic\\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, a preeminent establishment foreign policy writer who frequently writes about Israel.She talked extensively about the situation in Gaza, aligning herself tightly with Israel, and spoke in tough tones about Iran\\u2019s nuclear program. When asked about Syria\\u2019s civil war, she reiterated her past position that the U.S. should have assisted the Syrian rebels sooner, the efficacy of which Obama has rejected as a \\u201cfantasy.\\u201d And as far as the \\u201cDon\\u2019t do stupid stuff\\u201d mantra, she said it was not \\u201can organizing principle\\u201d \\u2014 something that \\u201cgreat nations\\u201d need.( Also on POLITICO: Axelrod swipes at Clinton over Iraq)Despite her pains to praise Obama in the interview \\u2014 and the fact that her positions on the issues were already publicly known \\u2014 her comments were widely interpreted through a political prism that casts her as a calculating figure, and that therefore this must have been part of an intentional calibration away from the increasingly unpopular Obama.Several Clinton supporters have stressed that she is entitled to her own views, and that she is in a bind \\u2014 either criticized as overly calculating if she stays silent or faulted for being candid about what she thinks.One of the criticisms about her interview relates to its timing: It comes as Obama is attempting to get his arms around a number of overseas crises, from Ukraine to Gaza to Syria.Follow @politico\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 80121}"
