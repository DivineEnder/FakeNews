"{\"content\": \"Much time and effort have been spent trying to educate scientists to communicate better with politicians and lawmakers \\u2013 as well as the public. The results, however, have been unimpressive.This is not because scientists use incomprehensible technical jargon. The problem is that cutting-edge science is imprecise.New ideas and information usually come with caveats \\u2014 and a large pinch of salt. Limited to specific situations, they need further testing, before they become widely accepted. This doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s not the best information science has at the time. It just needs to be treated carefully.It\\u2019s a matter of weighing a known cost against possible risks. For example, if new research indicates that eating spinach may increase risk of miscarriage by 10 percent, many pregnant women might stop eating it \\u2013 even if results are preliminary.On the other hand, if scientists say that eating chocolate daily for 60 years might shorten your life by a week, most people might throw caution to the winds and reach for that assortment box.Social issues are more complicated, because benefits are uneven.But environmental issues are where the real problem lies. Costs tend to be distributed unevenly and possible benefits may not be apparent for years or decades or \\u2013 if the goal is to avoid some problem \\u2013 never.The Conference of Parties 16, the U.N. climate change meeting, begins Monday in Cancun. So let\\u2019s consider the failure of the COP15 in Copenhagen. There, China and the United States, two countries with the most to do to reduce carbon emissions to sustainable levels, effectively blocked any real progress.They did this largely because the financial costs of reducing emissions now are high and unpalatable domestically. Especially in the United States, where \\u201cuncertainty\\u201d over the science is often exaggerated and exploited by those who stand to lose the most.Science is an iterative process. Scientists hold up concepts as truth, then work to disprove or refine them. This time-consuming process eventually produces widely accepted truths \\u2013 theories or laws like gravity, for example, or, evolution and those relating to electricity. Many forget these laws remain science \\u2013 so could still possibly be disproved.But human health and environmental policy require management decisions ahead of scientific certainty \\u2013 one reason why red wine is good for you one year, bad the next. New results come out, undergo scientific scrutiny and medical advice gets changed.\", \"article_id\": 17993, \"source_id\": 1, \"title\": \"Scientific talk on climate change\"}"
