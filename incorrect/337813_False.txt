"{\"title\": \"At CPAC, a Bustling Marketplace for the Republican Party&#8217;s Brand Names\", \"content\": \"{\\\"OXON HILL, Md. \\u2014Newt Gingrichput in a word for his wife\\u2019s line of children\\u2019s history books featuring an inquisitive pachyderm named Ellis the Elephant.\\\",\\\"AsSarah Palinwas thrashing President Obama\\u2019s foreign policy, a copy of her best seller on the secularization of Christmas was being peddled at a kiosk downstairs.\\\",\\\"A Trump logo stenciled in gold, in the same capital letters emblazoned on real estate and casinos all over the world, caught the eye on a seven-foot sign that greeted activists \\u2014 potential consumers, every one \\u2014 as they streamed into a convention hall.\\\",\\\"The commerce of conservatism has never been more robust. And here at the right\\u2019s biggest trade show, the annualConservative Political Action Conference, just about everyone is selling something.\\\",\\\"Political figures\\u2019 seeing financial incentives in keeping their names circulating as presidential hopefuls is nothing new. But the merging of political and profit motives has gotten to the point where many Republicans say they fear that their nominating process has begun to look like a machine for generating and heightening brand awareness.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere are a lot of reasons for running for president,\\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News. \\u201cAnd getting to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue often isn\\u2019t one of them.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The conservative movement today has a cast of celebrities best exemplified by people like Ms. Palin andDonald J. Trump, whose net worths depend in part on maximum media exposure. Ms. Palin has her own channel and a stable of books. Mr. Trump has his NBC program, \\u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\\u201d; the Miss Universe franchise; and numerous hotel and resort properties. (It did not go unnoticed that he publicly floated the idea in January that he might run in 2016, right around the time the Miss Universe pageant was airing and \\u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\\u201d season was building toward its finale.)\\\",\\\"Republicans also note that there is not really any analogue on the left. While celebrity liberals like the comedian Bill Maher and the filmmaker Michael Moore earn their livings as quasi-political figures, they do it independently of the Democrats\\u2019 political structure, without dangling the idea that they might run for office themselves. (Not that top-tier Democrats have any compunction about capitalizing on their political fame: Mr. Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton have both made millions from their books.)\\\",\\\"But the conference here, universally known as CPAC, is one of the Republican Party\\u2019s premier venues for candidates who are thinking about running for president. And on Friday afternoon, none other than Mr. Trump was given a prime speaking slot.\\\",\\\"(Sensing the crowd\\u2019s lack of enthusiasm, Mr. Trump addressed those who think he is faking it. \\u201cI\\u2019m not doing this for fun,\\u201d he insisted. Yet it took him all of three minutes to plug one of his books.)\\\",\\\"The financial incentives flow in two directions, however. TheAmerican Conservative Union, which hosts CPAC, collected money from Mr. Trump\\u2019s company for the privilege of displaying his logo outside the event and on its website as an associate sponsor. Top-tier sponsors pay as much as $25,000 to $50,000, two contributors said this week.\\\",\\\"The group also asked some of the high-profile speakers invited this year if they would lend their names to its direct mail fund-raising solicitations.\\\",\\\"Republicans say they see two related but worrisome factors at work.\\\",\\\"First, they say, the party has become too willing to look the other way when flawed candidates step forward, as Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain did in 2012. Second, the dilution of the field has encouraged less-than-serious candidates to exploit the Republican nominating contest for their own purposes.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey\\u2019re make-believe candidates, but we all agree to pretend that maybe they will run,\\u201d said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. \\u201cWhy?\\u201d\\\",\\\"But Mr. Norquist said Republicans were losing patience, especially when the potential 2016 field has so many serious contenders.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOn a stage with Bush, Walker, Christie, Jindal, Perry, Rand and Cruz,\\u201d he asked, \\u201cthe munchkins are going to be taken seriously?\\u201d\\\",\\\"Some of the second-tier candidates worry Republicans because they fear that the party is, once again, entertaining too many contenders who lack a serious chance at the nomination. Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon, has a devoted fan base but has never run for political office before. Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a failed 2012 presidential candidate, has also not ruled out a run in 2016. Some Republicans fear that both could pose unwanted distractions.\\\",\\\"Mr. Santorum spoke at the conference on Friday as well \\u2014 and then signed copies of the book he and his wife, Karen, had written.\\\",\\\"As for Mr. Trump, few Republicans believe he will actually run, despite his recently hiring the Iowa-based political consultant who helped Mr. Santorum win the state\\u2019s caucuses in 2012.\\\",\\\"After all, Mr. Trump has perfected the presidential head fake for the better part of three decades. His first flirtation was in 1987, right as his book \\u201cTrump: The Art of the Deal\\u201d was going on sale. He did it again in 1999, when he sought the support of the Reform Party, whose chief at the time, Pat Choate,called hima \\u201chustler.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In 2011, discussing a potential 2012 campaign, he told The New York Times, \\u201cI\\u2019m very serious.\\u201d\\\",\\\"This week, he told The Washington Post he was more serious than ever, backing up the assertion by saying he had not committed to a new season of \\u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But an executive at NBC said that the planning for the next season was still far out, and that Mr. Trump would not normally be expected to have committed to the show by this point.\\\",\\\"On Friday, as Mr. Trump stood on stage at CPAC with Sean Hannity, Mr. Hannity pointed out that he was wearing a tie from Mr. Trump\\u2019s retail collection.\\\",\\\"That was not enough of a plug for Mr. Trump.\\\",\\\"\\u201cBuy \\u2019em at Macy\\u2019s,\\u201d he told the crowd.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 337813}"
