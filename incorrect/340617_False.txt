"{\"content\": \"{\\\"The most sensible approach to the Alpine geological wonderland known as the Dolomites is also the most evocative one. Here\\u2019s how it\\u2019s done: After the three-hour drive from Venice Marco Polo Airport toward Austria, pull off the autostrada into the inviting city of Bolzano.\\\",\\\"In the pedestrian zone on Piazza della Mostra you will encounter the town\\u2019s best restaurant, Zur Kaiserkron. The lunchtime flavors \\u2014 smoke-cured ham known as speck, orange-infused ravioli, honey-glazed duck with beet sauce, an array of local mountain cheeses \\u2014 inform you that you\\u2019ve arrived in a distinctive place with a robust Mitteleuropean sensibility that also has the capacity to surprise.\\\",\\\"As you proceed northward, note how the city gives way to silky green meadowland. And then suddenly you see it: the asymmetrical limestone spires of the Dolomites erupting from the placid landscape like a gigantic prehistoric paw in gruff welcome.\\\",\\\"I\\u2019d been to the Dolomites several times before my recent trip, but always in winter, when the hotels are monopolized by ski bums and many of the slender, high-altitude roads are impassable. Its high-season epicenter is the resort town of Cortina d\\u2019Ampezzo, the site of the 1956 Winter Olympics and today a snowy haven for fanciers of chic.\\\",\\\"An altogether different experience awaits a summer visitor. Prices are lower, rooms and tables at the best places are more accessible, the lifts are open to any and all sightseers, and its picturesque, if at times nerve-rackingly corkscrew, thoroughfares are far more easily negotiated. Shorn of its wintry curtain, the mountainous landscape leaves no doubt that \\u2014 with apologies to Tuscany, Sicily and Campania, home of the Amalfi Coast \\u2014 the Trentino-Alto Adige region bordering Austria and Switzerland featuresItaly\\u2019s most stunning topography.\\\",\\\"And in the summertime, when the sunlight lingers well after 9 in the evening, views of that topography invite a more leisurely appreciation.\\\",\\\"But the Dolomites aren\\u2019t for mere gazing, as I discovered in July after leaving Bolzano and ascending into the mountain village of Castelrotto. All around my car, an outbreak of physical fitness materialized: hundreds of men, women and children in jogging shorts or mounted on cycles or clacking downhill with their walking sticks. And a few miles outside of town, at the Adler Mountain Lodge where I checked in, a wellness convention seemed to be underway, with the hotel\\u2019s entire clientele shuffling cultlike in their terry cloth robes and slippers from sauna to massage to outdoor pool, which overlooked what has to be the most entrancing view in the entire region.\\\",\\\"The Adler is barely a year old and is as sleek and solicitous as any resort one might encounter in Aspen or Chamonix. I sat on the torchlit patio with a glass of local riesling and appraised the Dolomites. The 18 peaks \\u2014 some exceeding 9,000 feet \\u2014 form the centerpiece of a national park as well as a Unesco World Heritage site. They loom over deep valleys, wildflower-speckled meadows and a multitude of glistening lakes. Encased in their flinty bulk is the fossilized narrative of a rich marine life that perished in the Triassic period over 200 million years ago.\\\",\\\"As I sat there, the fading sun brushed dabs of gold and lavender against the rock faces. I contented myself by sending taunting photographs to my friends back home in Washington until a waiter appeared and gently inquired if I intended to eat dinner, as it was getting on 9:30. I submitted to an excellent five-course meal that included cauliflower soup with pine nuts, conchiglie pasta with prawns and lamb chops on a bed of anise-laced cabbage, and then returned to my room, drew back the curtains and opened the windows, so that when I awoke I could encounter immediate visual evidence that I hadn\\u2019t dreamed all of this.\\\",\\\"The next morning I perused the bulletin board next to the Adler\\u2019s reception desk, taking note of the day\\u2019s various hotel-sponsored physical activities that I would be missing. I had places to go, and the one road leading out of the hotel would soon be closed for several hours to accommodate a half-marathon whose participants would include members of Nigeria\\u2019s national track team (they train here annually because of the thin mountain air).\\\",\\\"My own wellness program was of a different sort. I was headed two hours east to San Vito di Cadore, an otherwise unimpressive town that hosted, inside a somewhat dreary hotel, the hottest new restaurant in the Dolomites. Aga is its name \\u2014 \\u201clike acqua,or water,\\u201d explained the impish co-chef and owner (with his partner Alessandra Del Favero) Oliver Piras, \\u201cbecause we\\u2019re simple, limpid and transparent.\\u201d He managed to say this with a straight face.\\\",\\\"The tiny, four-table restaurant has spartan, Scandinavian-like furnishings, with cuisine that showcases the 35 local herbs grown in Aga\\u2019s adjacent garden. But decidedly un-limpid courses like elderberry broth with eggplant-stuffed pasta, guinea fowl in juniper sauce and a sorbet with dwarf pine needles were as daring as they were delicious. I consumed everything fearlessly, knowing that my war on calories would soon begin at my next lodging, which was not accessible by car.\\\",\\\"Two miles outside the mountain village of Barbiano, I found the parking lot for Briol. I left my luggage in the trunk, stuffed a change of clothes into a backpack and proceeded toward a trail that maintained a murderous grade until, one hour later, the hotel at last came into view at an altitude of 4,000 feet.\\\",\\\"Briol is the warm and funky former mountain retreat of a Bolzano entrepreneur that has remained in his family since its construction in 1871. Some 50 family members still reside in the 15 residences strewn across the rolling property. In one such dwelling, irregularly shaped with a maze of small rooms, Freud stayed for a time as a guest of the architect who had built it.\\\",\\\"The inn itself is a reminder of the region\\u2019s peculiarities. German is the primary language spoken at the hotel (a legacy of the Austro-Hungarian empire, which possessed Alto Adige until surrendering it to Italy after the end of World War I). As is customary among mountaineers, I was greeted not with an aperitif but with a shot of grappa. The shaggy hikers hunched on wooden benches drinking beer. Creaky wooden floors, communal bathrooms and the complete absence of spa culture suggest that the featured attraction at Briol is not luxury but splendid isolation.\\\",\\\"While awaiting dinner on the balcony, I saw a young bearded man with a backpack trudging up the steep hill. He entered the dining room as I did, offered his hand and introduced himself as Martin Gojer \\u2014 one of the best winemakers in the region who had, to my surprise, taken me up on my offer to join me for dinner, which meant driving from his cellar in Bolzano and hiking up from Barbiano.\\\",\\\"Where the traditional mountain cuisine of the Dolomites is hearty and no-frills, its wine is precise but somewhat characterless, owing to the cooperatives that predominate in Alto Adige. Mr. Gojer\\u2019s winery, Pranzegg (named after his family\\u2019s 455-year-old property), represents a welcome break. From his backpack he produced a bottle of one of Pranzegg\\u2019s red wines \\u2014 made from the indigenous schiava grape, long understood to be a lowly varietal (\\u201cschiava\\u201d means \\u201cslave\\u201d) \\u2014 and poured it as our beef with polenta arrived. Its austere elegance was almost Burgundian.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI had a conversation with Josko Gravner that had a big impact on me,\\u201d Mr. Gojer, 36, said, referring to the revered if quixotic Friuli winemaker who ferments his white wines in terra-cotta amphoras. \\u201cHe said, \\u2018A wine without a soul is just a beverage.\\u2019 He encouraged me to find my own path.\\u201d\\\",\\\"I did the same myself, at 5 the next morning. A tangerine ribbon of sunlight creased the horizon as I began the first of my daily climbs. Black squirrels and a single mountain goat scurried off at my huffing approach along the forest path.\\\",\\\"The hundreds of hiking trails throughout the Dolomites are well marked; many of them feel scarcely used, plunging you into a remoteness that might be disquieting, except that at every clearing you look up to find yourself saluted by that familiar 18-fingered paw.\\\",\\\"Briol is manifestly a destination for solitude-seekers. Departing that morning after a stout breakfast and hiking downhill to my car, I made my way northward to the much-visited but charming town of Corvara. I had known to stay away from it the day before: The roads around Corvara had been closed all morning because of the Maratona, an annual cycling event that had attracted 9,000 participants from 67 countries. A day later, and indeed throughout my six-day stay, I encountered packs of two-wheelers gamely surging up every mountain road I traversed.\\\",\\\"\\u201cBiking is the new golf,\\u201d the Maratona\\u2019s affable president, Michil Costa, told me as we sat over espressos in the reception room of his family\\u2019s handsome hotel, appropriately named La Perla, where I would stay the next two days. \\u201cYou look at these bikes they\\u2019re riding \\u2014 they cost thousands of dollars. Back in 1997 when I became president of this event, biking was for the poor. Now it\\u2019s turned into a big business for this area.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Elements of the Dolomites\\u2019 native inhabitants, the Ladins, remain, including the Ladino language itself (commonly spoken wherever I visited) and the sense of reserve prevalent in isolated mountain communities. Otherwise, the 54-year-old Mr. Costa told me, the region had seen much change during his lifetime here.\\\",\\\"His father had built La Perla in 1956, back when Corvara\\u2019s visitors got around on foot rather than on bicycles. At the son\\u2019s prodding, in 1982 the hotel opened the first fine-dining establishment in the Dolomites, La Stua di Michil. \\u201cFor a full year, the concept didn\\u2019t work at all,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople here just wanted to eat polenta.\\u201d But as high-dollar tourism seeped into the region, so did a demand for food that transcended mountain sustenance.\\\",\\\"La Stua di Michil became a Michelin-star restaurant, and before long two other nearby first-class hotels \\u2014 Rosa Alpina and Ciasa Salares, both in San Cassiano \\u2014 would also offer outstanding cuisine. And though the standard fare at the mountain osterias known as rifugios largely remains slabs of speck and strong local cheese, there are exceptions \\u2014 most notably Col Alt, a rifugio above Corvara accessible only by ski lift, where meat dishes take the form of succulent venison or rabbit, and bottles of aged Barolo offer a noble complement to the soaring mountain vistas.\\\",\\\"One night I was having an excellent dinner at La Stua di Michil, an intimate wood-paneled restaurant with a featured soundtrack of the American jazz trumpeter Chet Baker (whose tragic life was distilled into a few loving paragraphs alongside the evening\\u2019s menu), when La Perla\\u2019s resident hiking guide, Marco Sacchelli, strolled in. The lean, ponytailed guide went from table to table, wanting to know who was game for a fairly challenging four-hour hike the next day. I said that I was in.\\\",\\\"The next morning at 10, the hotel van deposited eight of us at the Alpe di Fanes, the plains from which we began a ferocious ascent, followed by a walk through a blissful stretch of meadow and silvery springs before the uphill climb recommenced for nearly an hour. At last we found ourselves at a plateau, standing directly between two peaks of the Dolomites, Cima del Lago and Cima Scotoni, 7,500 feet above sea level. A stubborn pocket of the previous winter\\u2019s snow remained beside our feet. Directly below us, perhaps a thousand feet downhill, a fava bean-shaped lake of impossible exquisiteness shimmered. It looked no less beautiful when we stood right beside it an hour later.\\\",\\\"I did not think any experience could trump what I had already had, until I roller-coaster-rode my way westward from Corvara and into the sumptuous Val di Sarentino. After driving through the town of Sarentino, the road shot uphill again and narrowed into essentially a one-lane, paved trail for about four miles. It dead-ended at Auener Hof, a 10-room Relais &amp; Chateaux wellness resort affixed to its Michelin-star restaurant, Terra. The hotel is owned and operated by two siblings, Gisela and Heinrich Schneider, who respectively double as the restaurant\\u2019s sommelier and chef and whose grandfather built the original structure in 1940, back when the area lacked plumbing and electricity and, for that matter, a roadway.\\\",\\\"Now Auener Hof lacks for nothing. Opting for rigor over Zen, I forwent the spa\\u2019s silver quartzite primordial stone massage and set out uphill for a 75-minute hike to something more straightforwardly primitive: the Stoanernen Mandeln, or Stone Men, a bizarre assemblage of 100 or so sandstone figures presumably constructed by ancient shepherds for reasons of their own. Midway into the trek, the skies suddenly went dark and I found myself in the middle of a hailstorm. I kept going, telling myself that the icy stones pummeling my back were akin to a massage and that my fingers would eventually regain their warmth.\\\",\\\"The storm abruptly stopped just as I took my place among the stone sculptures. Before long, sunlight drenched the meadows; a half-dozen cattle lay on the trail in front of me, blocking my passage. I climbed a fence, jogged the rest of the way downhill and concluded I\\u2019d earned myself an epic dinner.\\\",\\\"Which was precisely what I got that evening at Terra, an architecturally theatrical structure, with its birch trunk pillars and 13 well-spaced tables and glass-encased kitchen \\u2014 not to mention a view through the glass wall that took in not only the Dolomites but, directly below, the spectacle of a deer nursing her fawn. Each of the 16 courses (many of them bite-size) was intricately sculpted and served on ceramic or stone works of art themselves, accompanied by beguiling wines that reflected Gisela Schneider\\u2019s affection for small and offbeat producers like Norbert Kofler and Andi Solva. From the saffron, lavender and salmon-tinted breadsticks to the slow-baked wild carrots to a crunchy fried pigeon cannelloni to the pike with a sauce of wheatgrass and mangel beet, I coasted through my three hours at Terra with the giddiness of a Ladin schoolboy tumbling through a field of edelweiss.\\\",\\\"I would have given anything to stay another night at Auener Hof. But the hiking guide Marco Sacchelli had urged me to consider one last outdoor rendezvous before I said goodbye to the Dolomites. Begrudgingly, I left the hotel the next morning and headed eastward under a dulcet blue sky to Cortina d\\u2019Ampezzo. About seven miles outside of town, I parked alongside the roadway, grabbed my backpack a final time and began the two-hour climb along Passo Tre Croci.\\\",\\\"It was for the most part a mellow and even festive ascent. My compatriots included picnickers, infants strapped to their mothers\\u2019 backs, a few gallant dogs and a young woman wearing a cap of feathers. Still, the last quarter-mile practically required scaling the rocks on all fours. And so it was in a state of fatigued stupefaction that I at last found myself gathering breath before a large and utterly still body of water with a creamy mint hue like nothing I\\u2019d ever seen before. Apparently the other hikers felt the same way. We all stood on the shoreline, gaping in silence at Lago di Sorapiss, as if waiting for something from another epoch to rise up from its milky surface.\\\",\\\"It\\u2019s been a few weeks since my visit and I still make a daily habit of returning to that image: the obscure pool in the wild nestled beneath the surly majesty of the Dolomites \\u2014 there to be relished, not explained.\\\",\\\"Adler Mountain Lodge,above, Via Piz 11, Castelrotto, 39-0471-723000;adler-lodge.com.
