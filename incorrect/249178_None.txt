"{\"title\": \"SolarCity and the Silver Spoon\", \"content\": \"Your growth is dependent on government generosity. And, when people, who may never buy your product or use your service, balk at underwriting your venture and convince their Congressmen to take away the taxpayer largess, you threaten to take your marbles and go home\\u2014leaving former staffers unemployed and customers without service.Such is the story of SolarCity, which has taken advantage of the favored status and bilked government programs to grow into being the nation\\u2019s largest installer of rooftop solar panels. Despite that distinction, the company founded by Elon Musk and brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive still loses millions of dollars.SolarCity has no qualms about throwing a tantrum and leaving a state that doesn\\u2019t play by its rules\\u2014as it has done in Arizona, Nevada, and, even in the UK. Even uber-green California is being threatened by an exodus and states such as Washington and New Hampshire received warnings that SolarCity won\\u2019t come to the state if subsidies don\\u2019t favor its operational model.Last week, Nevada became the latest state to \\u201croll back\\u201d its \\u201cnet-metering electricity scam,\\u201d as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) calls it. As a result, \\u201cSolarCity reacted by announcing that it would cease sales and installations in the state.\\u201d \\u00a0Back in 2013, with great fanfare, SolarCity announced that it was coming to Nevada \\u201cafter securing incentives worth up to $1.2 million from the state\\u2019s Governor\\u2019s Office of Economic Development,\\u201d reported the Silicon Valley Business Journal. SolarCity claimed it would create \\u201chundreds of jobs\\u201d near Las Vegas. But times have changed.Nevada is just one of many states considering changes to the subsidies offered to encourage rooftop solar installations. Arizona already made the change, causing SolarCity to shift resources to other states where the profit margins are higher. In April, the Arizona Republic announced that SolarCity was relocating 85 workers out of state. SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive called the changes: \\u201cToo restrictive.\\u201d He declared that they \\u201celiminate the potential to save money with solar for nearly all customers.\\u201dWhat states have found, is that the increasing implementation of solar, results in higher costs for non-solar customers\\u2014who as the WSJ states: \\u201ctend to be lower income.\\u201dThe net-metering policies are at the center of the debate. In short, net metering compensates solar customers for the excess solar power they generate. The problem is that these individual generators get paid retail for the power, rather than the wholesale rate utilities pay for typical power supplies. As a result, customers with solar panels can completely avoid paying the utility\\u2014even though they still use power, transmission lines, and services from the company. States are seeing costs shifted from solar customers to those who can least afford it. As a result, several states, including Nevada, California, and Washington have mandated policy changes. Generally, the changes reduce the payment to wholesale and add a grid connection fee or demand fee.The WSJ called net metering \\u201cregressive political income redistribution in support of a putatively progressive cause.\\u201d Frank O\\u2019Sullivan, director of research and analysis at MIT Energy Initiative explains it: \\u201cNet metering, in its most plain, vanilla form, is certainly a subsidy to rooftop solar owners. Obviously there has to be a cost transfer to others who don\\u2019t have solar on their roofs.\\u201dIn Arizona, the changes to the net-metering policies grandfathered in current users, but added grid usage/demand fees. In Nevada, payments to existing customers have been slashed and connection fees have been raised. The current proposal in California would cut payments for excess electricity almost in half and solar customers would pay a monthly fee. In Washington, utilities are pushing for a charge on solar customers.The solar industry is filing legal action as, admittedly, these \\u201cproposals threaten to undermine the economics of their systems.\\u201d WSJ explains: \\u201ccorporate welfare encourages dependency and entitlement that\\u2019s difficult to break.\\u201dExplaining the industry\\u2019s reaction to changing policy, Rep. Jeff Morris, the sponsor of proposed legislation in Washington, HB 2045, said: \\u201cThe reason they are going off the rails on this is because they are afraid that it\\u2019s going to sweep across the 50 states.\\u201dIt is the state and federal incentives, not free markets, which have created a burgeoning solar industry. Congress foolishly extended the federal credits. But with \\u201crecent improvements in solar costs and efficiencies,\\u201d as Lori Christian, president of Solar Installers of Washington says: \\u201cit is time for all states to reassess the outdated incentive structure currently in place.\\u201dWhen even California is proposing policy changes that would result in solar power being less-cost effective for homeowners and businesses, it is time to realize this business model has to change. And, that includes taking the silver spoon out of the mouth of SolarCity. Although they\\u2019ll likely throw a temper tantrum, take their marbles and go home, it will save taxpayers millions and force solar to operate on a level playing field like other businesses have to do.The author of\\u00a0Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for\\u00a0Energy Makes America Great Inc., and the companion educational organization, the\\u00a0Citizens\\u2019 Alliance for Responsible Energy\\u00a0(CARE).
