"{\"title\": \"Bowe Bergdahl to Face Court-Martial on Desertion Charges\", \"content\": \"{\\\"A top Army commander on Monday ordered that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl face a court-martial on charges of desertion and endangering troops stemming from his decision to leave his outpost in 2009, a move that prompted a huge manhunt in the wilds of easternAfghanistanand landed him in nearly five years of harshTalibancaptivity.\\\",\\\"The decision by Gen. Robert B. Abrams, head of Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, N.C., means that Sergeant Bergdahl, 29, faces a possible life sentence. That is a far more serious penalty than had been recommended by the Army\\u2019s investigating officer, who testified at the sergeant\\u2019s preliminary hearing in September that prison would be \\u201cinappropriate.\\u201d\\\",\\\"According to Sergeant Bergdahl\\u2019s defense lawyers, the Army lawyer who presided over the preliminary hearing also recommended that he faceneither jail time nor a punitive dischargeand that he go before an intermediate tribunal known as a \\u201cspecial court-martial,\\u201d where the most severe penalty possible would be a year of confinement.\\\",\\\"Monday\\u2019s decision rejecting that recommendation means that Sergeant Bergdahl now faces a maximum five-year penalty if ultimately convicted by a military jury of desertion, as well as potential life imprisonment on the more serious charge of misbehavior before the enemy, which in this case means endangering the troops who were sent to search for him after he disappeared.\\\",\\\"Sergeant Bergdahl has been the focus of attacks by Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign, and it is far from clear that General Abrams\\u2019s decision will temper their criticisms.\\\",\\\"Donald J. Trump, for one, has called the sergeant a \\u201ctraitor\\u201d who should be executed, while Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has vowed to hold hearings if the sergeant is not punished.\\\",\\\"Last week, House Republicans issued a report portraying as reckless and illegal Mr. Obama\\u2019s decision in May 2014 to swap Sergeant Bergdahl for fiveTalibandetainees who were being held at Guant\\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\\\",\\\"The Army did not elaborate on Monday\\u2019s decision by General Abrams, or on why he decided that Sergeant Bergdahl should face the potential for a far more serious punishment than what the two independent Army fact-finders had recommended. A spokesman for Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg noted in an email that recommendations made by preliminary hearing officers \\u201care advisory in nature.\\u201d\\\",\\\"No date has been set for Sergeant Bergdahl\\u2019s next court hearing, which will be held at Fort Bragg, the Army said. He is currently assigned to the Army\\u2019s Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, the site of his preliminary hearing in September.\\\",\\\"In a terse statement after the decision, Sergeant Bergdahl\\u2019s chief defense lawyer, Eugene R. Fidell, said that General Abrams \\u201cdid not follow the advice of the preliminary hearing officer who heard the witnesses,\\u201d and added that he \\u201chad hoped the case would not go in this direction.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He also criticized some politicians who have spoken out on the case, saying they have inflamed opinions against the sergeant.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe again ask that Donald Trump cease his prejudicial monthslong campaign of defamation against our client,\\u201d Mr. Fidell said in a statement. \\u201cWe also ask that the House and Senate Armed Services Committees avoid any further statements or actions that prejudice our client\\u2019s right to a fair trial.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. McCain\\u2019s office declined to comment on Monday.\\\",\\\"General Abrams\\u2019s decision came just days after Sergeant Bergdahl was heard for the first time publicly explaining why he left his base, in taped interviews that were broadcast by the podcast \\u201cSerial\\u201d last week.\\\",\\\"In the interviews, which were recorded by Mark Boal, the screenwriter and producer, Sergeant Bergdahl said that he realized within 20 minutes of leaving that he had done \\u201csomething serious.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In the interviews, he told the same story that he had described to the Army\\u2019s investigating officer, Lt. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, about why he left the outpost: He wanted to cause a crisis by hiking to another base 18 miles away that would allow him to have an audience with a senior Army commander where he could outline what he felt were serious leadership problems endangering his unit.\\\",\\\"Sergeant Bergdahl told Mr. Boal that during his hike he had also decided to surveil Taliban fighters emplacing improvised explosive devices that could be used to kill American soldiers, and to turn that information over to commanders when he arrived at the other base. He said that he \\u201cwas trying to prove to the world\\u201d that he was a top soldier, and that in some sense he even wanted to emulate someone like Jason Bourne, the spy-movie character.\\\",\\\"The Army Forces Command spokesman said those statements on \\u201cSerial\\u201d played no role in General Abrams\\u2019s announcement, or its timing.\\\",\\\"But some critics doubted that. Joe Kasper, the chief of staff for Representative Duncan Hunter of California, a Republican helping lead congressional efforts to investigate the trade for Sergeant Bergdahl, said the sergeant\\u2019s comments \\u201cforced the Army\\u2019s hand.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhen that podcast hit, whatever sympathy there was for Bergdahl dried up,\\u201d Mr. Kasper said. \\u201cHe did himself absolutely no favors by talking.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Republicans have asserted that the swap would embolden the Taliban to kidnap other Americans and that it was done without the required notification of Congress. Some Republicans and members of Sergeant Bergdahl\\u2019s unit have also asserted that a half-dozen or more American troops died searching for him.\\\",\\\"But in his testimony, General Dahl \\u2014 who was recently promoted from major general to lieutenant general \\u2014 said that no troops had died specifically searching for Sergeant Bergdahl and that no evidence was found to support claims that he intended to walk to China or India or that he was a Taliban sympathizer.\\\",\\\"At the Texas hearing, an Army prosecutor, Maj. Margaret Kurz, described a frantic but fruitless search for Sergeant Bergdahl in the weeks after he disappeared.\\\",\\\"\\u201cFor 45 days, thousands of soldiers toiled in the heat, dirt, misery and sweat with almost no rest, little water and little food to find the accused,\\u201d Major Kurz said. \\u201cFatigued and growing disheartened, they search for the accused knowing he left deliberately.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The prosecution\\u2019s witnesses included Sergeant Bergdahl\\u2019s former platoon leader and company and battalion commanders, who all recounted the scramble to find the soldier after he was reported missing early on June 30, 2009.\\\",\\\"His former platoon leader, Capt. John Billings, testified about his \\u201cutter disbelief that I couldn\\u2019t find one of my own men.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He and the other commanders said soldiers searched almost nonstop, never knowing when the ordeal would end, while their underlying mission to support Afghan security forces fell by the wayside. The manhunt involved thousands of troops across thousands of square miles.\\\",\\\"General Dahl described Sergeant Bergdahl as a truthful but delusional soldier, who identified with John Galt, the hero of Ayn Rand\\u2019s \\u201cAtlas Shrugged.\\u201d He also said that Sergeant Bergdahl\\u2019s worries about severe problems in his unit were unwarranted, but that he found that his concerns were sincerely held.\\\",\\\"Another defense witness, Terrence Russell, who debriefed Sergeant Bergdahl after his release, testified that the sergeant had suffered more in captivity than any American since Vietnam, including beatings with rubber hoses and copper cables, and uncontrollable diarrhea for more than three years.\\\",\\\"The defense team, led by Mr. Fidell, argued that Sergeant Bergdahl did everything an American serviceman was supposed to do in captivity, trying to escape numerous times despite the harsh treatment the attempts brought him, and never revealing secrets.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 342885}"
