"{\"title\": \"Review: Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian\", \"content\": \"If the first \\u201cNight at the Museum\\u201d was weighed down with a cookie-cutter plot involving the stale idea of a single dad desperate to redeem himself in his son\\u2019s eyes, \\u201cNight at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian\\u201d has no weight whatsoever thanks to a flat story loaded with monstrous plot holes and a cast of dull, one-dimensional characters.There\\u2019s also only one laugh \\u2014 one \\u2014 and all the special effects in the world simply can\\u2019t make up for a single chuckle over 105 very long minutes. The only good news is that Ben Stiller appeared to be even more bored than I was.\\n\\nIf you remember, Larry Daley (Stiller) was once a night guard at the Museum of Natural History in New York City where after the sun went down, thanks to ancient artifact, the exhibits all came to life. Mayhem ensued, adventure was had and lifelong friendships were formed.A few years have passed (between films and for our characters) and today Larry has managed to tinker his way into fortune and some fame as a highly successful entrepreneur hawking inventions, like his glow-in-the-dark flashlight (so you can find it when the power goes out, duh), on infomercials.    As is always the case in these films, success has made Larry unhappy and distracted, too worried about business meetings and deal-making to be the good father and friend he once was. For months now he\\u2019s neglected his museum friends and when he does show up for a long overdue visit he finds most of them boxed up for permanent storage, bound for the basement of the Smithsonian in Washington DC.Of course Larry will have to save them and in the process the entire Smithsonian comes alive, including paintings, sculptures, a black and white Al Capone, a preening General Custer (Bill Hader), an obnoxious, hyper-feminist Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) and even the giant President Lincoln normally found seated in his DC memorial.   Returning for a second round is Owen Wilson\\u2019s  miniature cowboy, who\\u2019s given much more to do than the barely returning Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt, Attila the Hun and Sacajawea.Hank Azaria is our flamboyant baddie Kahmunrah, a lisping Pharaoh desperate to get his hands on the artifact that brought him and everything else to life. The plan is to resurrect his 2000 year old army and take over the world \\u2026 or some such thing.\\n\\nOther than the special effects, which are convincing, it\\u2019s obvious no one cared about anything else like believable relationships or a plot that made a lick of sense. The plot holes that keep Larry alive and running around all on his own are insulting. This isn\\u2019t a movie aimed at kids, this is a movie aimed at dumb kids \\u2026 kids in need of helmets.The dialogue\\u2019s terrible, full of those halting, irreverent asides that increasingly pass for wit these days, and the action scenes lack both excitement and tension. People run, people fight, people talk and talk and talk. Every character arc feels forced, the relationships even more so. When the great Ricky Gervais  can\\u2019t brighten up his bookended moments, what hope is there for anything else?Most lacking is any sense of magic or joy. When a movie advertises the Smithsonian coming to life, no matter how lackluster the rest might be, you expect at least a couple of \\u201cwow\\u201d moments, but there\\u2019s not a single one.\\n\\nIf there\\u2019s anything to recommend it\\u2019s a rare and appreciated  sense of reverence director Shawn Levy shows for American history in this, a mainstream Hollywood film produced for young, impressionable minds. Even  General Custer  is given an un-PC opportunity to redeem himself and it\\u2019s nice to hear  Teddy Roosevelt call America \\u201ca great country\\u201d and Amelia Earhart credit \\u201cAmerican ingenuity\\u201d for the invention of flight. It\\u2019s just a sad fact  these days that  characters aren\\u2019t allowed to talk like this.    Most interesting is a moment in front of the White House when a historical character says something like, \\u201cI\\u2019ve heard a great man leads this union.\\u201d You have to wonder if that line would\\u2019ve been allowed when Bush was president or had McCain won\\u2026 Damn, I\\u2019m cynical.Between this and the equally uninspired \\u201cTerminator Salvation,\\u201d if you must leave the house for a movie this holiday weekend, Blockbuster is your best gamble.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 279656}"
