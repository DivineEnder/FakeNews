"{\"title\": \"The Dumbest 'Journalism' About Melania Trump's RNC Speech\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"While the RNC entered its second day, when her husband Donald Trump would officially become the party\\u2019s presidential nominee, various \\u201cobjective\\u201d news outlets blew up Melania\\u2019s speech into a massive scandal, hounding top RNC officials for answers.As is often the case in a high-traffic controversy, this led to tons of hot takes\\u00a0and downright silly questions\\u2013with even sillier \\u201cexperts\\u201d called in for analysis. Here are today\\u2019s worst offenders:1.\\u00a0CNN profiled\\u00a0the man who first made the claim that parts of Mrs. Trump\\u2019s speech were plagiarized, and Brooke Baldwin brought him on air for an\\u00a0interview:2. CNN\\u00a0also\\u00a0seemed to think that heads should roll:3. Politico\\u2018s Blake Hounshell\\u00a0hunted down the details of how Jeb Bush announced his doomed presidential campaign:Others noted that the would-be first lady\\u2019s remarks \\u2014 delivered Monday night at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland \\u2014 didn\\u2019t seem to have gotten the same level of scrubbing as, for instance, just one of the speakers teed up for Jeb Bush\\u2019s announcement of his presidential bid.4. The\\u00a0Washington Post\\u2013with the triple byline of\\u00a0Emma Brown, Nick Anderson, and T. Rees Shapiro\\u2013interviewed a high school teacher, the \\u201cdirector of the Ethics Institute at Dartmouth,\\u201d and disgraced former journalist Jayson Blair\\u2026 coming up with this doozy of a headline:5. David Muir, the anchor of ABC\\u2019s primetime news broadcast, asked Donald Trump Jr., \\u201cDo you believe Michelle Obama is owed an apology?\\u201dON @ABCWorldNews: Donald Trump Jr. says apology to FLOTUS not necessary for speech likeness. https://t.co/TDtXBkzbckhttps://t.co/gzBwMVZEu3\\u2014 ABC News (@ABC) July 19, 2016BONUS:\\u00a0Glenn Beck (who doesn\\u2019t count, as he is a commentator) speculated that someone intentionally inserted the controversial passage to embarrass the Trumps.\\u201cI don\\u2019t think Donald Trump or Melania had anything to do with it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think somebody sabotaged them. I think this was done intentionally. No good speechwriter does that.\\u201d (Hat tip: Mediaite)\", \"article_id\": 309246}"
