"{\"title\": \"After a Summer of Silence, Ed Miliband Finally Talks About ISIS\", \"content\": \"Writing for the Independent, Mr Miliband called for a political and diplomatic campaign at home and abroad, although remains vague on whether he will support British military action.In Britain, Miliband says that the government needs to introduce a \\u201cmandatory programme of deradicalisation for anyone who is drawn into the fringes of extremism in Syria and Iraq\\u201d, while also calling for \\u201cclarity about our objectives and the means to achieve them.\\u201dHe also adds: \\u201cIn the face of this danger I am clear we cannot\\u2026 simply shrug our shoulders and hope it goes away.\\u201dDespite this, he refused to go into specifics about Britain\\u2019s role in Iraq. While ruling out British \\u201cboots on the ground\\u201d and saying that Labour supports US airstrikes against ISIS, he did not comment on whether he would support British airstrikes.Last year, Labour helped scupper British plans for airstrikes against Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad by opposing military action in parliament. The House of Commons subsequently voted down the proposals by 285 votes to 272.In making these comments, Mr Miliband becomes the last party leader to comment on the ongoing ISIS campaign this summer. In June, Prime Minister David Cameron said that ISIS militants pose a direct threat to the UK, while three days ago, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that British Muslims should do more stop young people becoming radicalised.Meanwhile, UKIP leader Nigel Farage called for a change in the law to remove the citizenship of British people who travel to fight with ISIS in Syria and Iraq to stop them coming back and spreading terror at home.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 203344}"
