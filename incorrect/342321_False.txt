"{\"content\": \"{\\\"All the Republican presidential candidates say they want to make the tax code simpler. But no candidate has been more aggressive about simplicity thanCarly Fiorina, who says \\u201cour tax code needs to go from 73,000 pages down to about three pages.\\u201d\\\",\\\"To be clear, Mrs. Fiorina is not calling for a three-page taxreturn. She is saying the entire taxlawof the federal government \\u2014 and apparently the accompanying regulations, since the Internal Revenue Code itself is 3,728 pages \\u2014 should be just a little longer than this article.\\\",\\\"On Tuesday,she pointed on Facebookto one way she thinks that could be done: by putting in place a tax plan proposed by the economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, who have produced draft legislation for a single-rate income tax that runs just 1,120 words.\\\",\\\"\\u201cReporters said it wasn\\u2019t possible,\\u201d wrote Sarah Isgur Flores, Mrs. Fiorina\\u2019s deputy campaign manager, on Twitter. \\u201cOnce again, media was wrong.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Actually, Mrs. Fiorina is wrong. The Hall-Rabushkalegislationis intended to replace not the entire Internal Revenue Code but just Subtitle A, which lays out rules about how much tax is due on what income.\\\",\\\"That would still leave Subtitles B through K, a further 1,445 pages describing taxes other than the income tax, and setting out important administrative matters like what happens if you don\\u2019t pay your taxes. Those pages would need to be retained or replaced with new law, unless Mrs. Fiorina wants theInternal Revenue Serviceto make up its own rules.\\\",\\\"Even replacing just Subtitle A with the three-page Hall-Rabushka version could cause significant problems.\\\",\\\"\\u201dThe minute it\\u2019s passed, I\\u2019m going to call my dean and tell her to pay me only in goods,\\u201d said Michael J. Graetz, a tax professor at Columbia Law School. \\u201cBuy me a house, buy me some groceries every week, buy me meals.\\u201d That\\u2019s because the three-page plan avoids complex rules about fringe benefits by saying noncash compensation is tax-free.\\\",\\\"That said, while the tax code can\\u2019t be reduced to three pages, it could be significantly simpler than it is today, and Mrs. Fiorina and most of her opponents have identified a source of both length and complexity: so-called tax preferences.\\\",\\\"When a provision of the tax code says one thing will be taxed and another thing will not, taxpayers are encouraged to contort their lives to do more of the untaxed thing and less of the taxed thing, paying lawyers and accountants to keep the records along the way.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIn my case, I have lawyers all over the place, I have accounting firms all over the place,\\u201dDonald Trumpsaid in August. Like all of his opponents, Mr. Trump says he would simplify the tax code by lowering tax rates and cutting the number of deductions and preferences offered. Unlike his opponents, he says his simplification would be so effective as to \\u201cputH&amp;R Blockout of business, knock \\u2019em out, put \\u2019em out of business.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But the candidates have missed the mark in a few ways. One is by conflating tax simplicity with the number of tax rates imposed by the I.R.S.\\\",\\\"\\u201cSimplify the income tax system to just three individual income tax rates, instead of the current six,\\u201d urges Gov.Chris Christie\\u2019s tax plan, although the actual number of tax bracketsis seven. But having too many tax brackets is not why it\\u2019s hard to do taxes.\\\",\\\"Once you know what your taxable income is, applying the right tax rates is simple arithmetic that tax software will do for you. If you make less than $100,000, you don\\u2019t even need to do arithmetic; you can read your tax liability on theconvenient tax tablespublished by the I.R.S. What make taxes complex are all the rules that determine your taxable income in the first place.\\\",\\\"The candidates\\u2019 plans would simplify the taxable income calculation, but they have been hesitant to make this calculation too simple for a reason: That would require taking away tax deductions, and people tend to like the deductions they take.\\\",\\\"Most Republican candidates, including Mr. Trump, have said their plans to attack tax preferences would not touch two of the biggest and most popular ones: deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable giving.\\\",\\\"So far, the candidate most committed to tax simplification may beBen Carson, who advocated abolishing the deduction for charitable giving at Tuesday\\u2019s debate. SenatorsTed CruzandRand Paulhave also proposed simple tax plans that would not only shrink the personal income tax and repeal most deductions but also abolish payroll taxes and the corporate income tax, replacing them with avalue-added tax, which is kind of like a national sales tax.\\\",\\\"In other countries, VATs tend to be quite complex, with different rates for different kinds of transactions and with many industries (like health care and education) exempted. But the VATs conceived by Mr. Paul and Mr. Cruz are supposed to apply broadly and equally across the whole economy, which would make them easy for businesses to comply with, and would also mean they could raisea lotof revenue, far outstripping the income tax.\\\",\\\"Other candidates\\u2019 plans are not so simple. SenatorMarco Rubioand Mr. Trump would both introduce a significant new source of complexity by taxing small-business profits at a lower rate than wage income; currently, they are taxed at the same rate.\\\",\\\"This change would encourage taxpayers to find ways to recharacterize their income as profits instead of wages, perhaps by becoming independent contractors. It would also require the I.R.S. to issue new rules about what is a wage and what is a profit, complicating life for people who have bona fide business income.\\\",\\\"There is also one approach to simplification that hasn\\u2019t been proposed by any of the Republican candidates: having the I.R.S. complete most people\\u2019s tax returns for them, requiring changes only if there is an error. This is already done in countries like Denmark and Spain. Tax complexity isn\\u2019t about just how many rules there are, but also about how many of those rules taxpayers actually have to confront. Auto-completion of tax forms would reduce complexity (and time and cost) as experienced by real people.\\\",\\\"One challenge with such a system is that tax returns depend not just on information known to the I.R.S. \\u2014 such as the wages your employer reports on form W-2 \\u2014 but on information it may not know, like your charitable giving. But if the tax code were simpler, with fewer deductions, it would be possible for the government to prepare an accurate, completed return for a greater share of tax filers.\\\",\\\"A change like that, along with simpler tax rules, might really put H&amp;R Block out of business.\\\"}\", \"title\": \"The Tax Code Can Be Simpler.
