"{\"title\": \"Bill Clinton Admits: Some Gave to Clinton Foundation for Favors\", \"content\": \"\\u201cThe rules we had worked great when she was Secretary of State, because if we made a mistake, you could appeal to the White House, and the White House obviously didn\\u2019t want anything to be done that shouldn\\u2019t be done,\\u201d Clinton told NPR.Asked whether he thought some Clinton Foundation donors might have given money in the expectation that the Clintons would be returning to the White House, and able to exert political influence on the donors\\u2019 behalf in the future, Clinton said:Well, since we had 300,000 donors, it would be unusual if nobody did. The names I saw in the paper, none of them surprised me, and all of them could have gotten their own meeting with Hillary\\u2026 It was natural for people who had been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn\\u2019t do anything they shouldn\\u2019t do, from a meeting to a favor. And so it didn\\u2019t surprise me that people would call from time to time. And maybe some of them gave money for that reason, but most of them gave it because they liked what we were doing, and because they knew me.New evidence of conflicts of interest between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department continues to emerge. Emails recently obtained by Judicial Watch, for example, show that Clinton Foundation staff interceded in 2011 with Clinton\\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, Cheryl Mills, to prevent the U.S. visa of\\u00a0Haitian Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive from being revoked.Mary Anastasia O\\u2019Grady, writing in the\\u00a0Wall Street Journal, notes that\\u00a0Clinton Foundation Chief Operating Officer Laura Graham was actually living at Bellerive\\u2019s house at the time, with the approval of both Mills and Bill Clinton.The Clintons\\u2019 ties to Haiti have come under closer scrutiny since Breitbart editor Peter Schweizer\\u2019s bestselling book Clinton Cash\\u00a0exposed the Clintons\\u2019 role in commandeering reconstruction efforts after the January 2010 earthquake. Bill Clinton and Bellerive were appointed to chair the Interim Haitian Relief Committee (IHRC), which received \\u2014 and wasted \\u2014 aid money, while some projects were approved that favored \\u201cClinton friends allies, and even family members\\u201d rather than local residents.Joel B.
