"{\"article_id\": 42563, \"title\": \"Carney: What I meant was...\", \"content\": \"White House press secretary Jay Carney says now that when he answered questions about what role the administration played in influencing the Benghazi talking points, he was talking only about a later version of the points and not the \\\"deliberative process\\\" that led to that version.Carney was pummeled with questions Friday after emails surfaced showing the State Department and the White House weighed in on the points significantly more than he first suggested. He had said in November that the \\\"single adjustment... made to those talking points by either of those two institutions were changing the word \\u2018consulate\\u2019 to \\u2018diplomatic facility\\u2019 because \\u2018consulate\\u2019 was inaccurate.\\u201dThe emails, first reported by the Weekly Standard and ABC News, show 12 revisions were made to the points after extensive input from the State Department and direction from the White House. As a result, references to an Al Qaeda affiliate and CIA warnings about terrorist threats preceding the attack were deleted.Carney insisted Friday that those revisions were part of the \\\"deliberative process\\\" that involved a number of agencies, and that the CIA version issued after that process was what he was referring to when he talked about the \\\"single\\\" stylistic change.\\\"The CIA, in this case deputy director of the CIA, took that process and issued a set of talking points that Saturday morning,\\\" he said. \\\"And the only edit \\u2026to those talking points\\\" was the change from consulate to diplomatic facility.The final talking points were used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice during Sunday show appearances the next day, Sept. 15.Carney said there are no plans to release the emails to the public, citing a longstanding precedent that internal deliberations are kept private so the administration can deliberate freely. He characterized the White House's effort to allow members of Congress to review the emails as \\\"extraordinary\\\" and an attempt to satisfy any questions Congress may have had.He also referred questions to the State Department about that agency's citing of political concerns in one email asking for revision of the talking points.A State Department spokeswoman wrote in the email that information about prior warnings should not be included in the points because members of Congress could use it \\\"to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings,\\\" ABC News reported.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
