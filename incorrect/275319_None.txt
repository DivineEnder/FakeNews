"{\"title\": \"Outgoing Intel Chief Slams Obama Anti-Terrorist Policy\", \"content\": \"The publication highlights the sharpest of his remarks:\\u201cThere is no substitute, none, for American power,\\u201d the general said, to occasional cheers and ultimately a standing ovation from a crowd of special operators and intelligence officers at a Washington industry conference.He also slammed the administration for refusing to use the term \\u201cIslamic militants\\u201d in its description of ISIS and al Qaeda.\\u201cYou cannot defeat an enemy you do not admit exists,\\u201d Flynn said.He said the administration is unwilling to admit the scope of the problem, naively clinging to the hope that limited counterterrorist intervention will head off the ideological juggernaut of religious militancy.\\u201cThere are many sincere people in our government who frankly are paralyzed by this complexity,\\u201d said Flynn, so they \\u201caccept a defensive posture, reasoning that passivity is less likely to provoke our enemies.\\u201dFlynn refused to name President Obama as the focus of his ire in comments afterward to The Daily Beast, saying that he was simply \\u201csending a message to the American people.\\u201d But the comments show the widening rift between some in the national-security community who want to see more special-operations and intelligence assets sent into the fight against ISIS and other groups in Syria and beyond.Flynn sat for an\\u00a0interview with James Kitfield of Breaking Defense, who introduces his guest as \\u201cdisruptive\\u201d in the estimation of his political adversaries. Those adversaries might just have been formidable enough to force the General into early retirement, a year ahead of schedule, their ire piqued by his penchant for disrupting preferred Obama Administration narratives about al-Qaeda and its progeny being \\u201con the run\\u201d after Osama bin Laden\\u2019s death.There\\u2019s more than just Islamist terrorism on the DIA plate after six years of Obama foreign policy. \\u201cI will frankly tell you that what I see each day is the most uncertain, chaotic, and confused international environment that I\\u2019ve witnessed in my entire career,\\u201d Flynn said in the Breaking Defense interview. He allowed that the world was arguably more dangerous when the Nazis and Imperial Japan were running wild, but \\u201cwe\\u2019re in another very dangerous era,\\u201d where \\u201cit feels like we\\u2019ll be facing a familiar threat and heightened uncertainty for a long time yet.\\u201dThings are dangerous enough for Flynn to judge that America is no safer from Islamist terror than it was before 9/11. \\u201cToday, there are 41 Islamic terrorist groups spread out in 24 countries,\\u201d he warned. \\u201cA lot of these groups have the intention to attack Western interests, to include Western embassies and in some cases Western countries. Some have both the intention and some capability to attack the United States homeland.\\u201d He\\u2019s particularly worried about terror operatives with military training flowing back into the West from ISIS conflict zones in Syria and Iraq, possibly with chemical weapons as souvenirs of their battle against the Assad regime.Most worrisome of all is the spread of an ideology as toxic as any weapon of mass destruction: the ideology of perpetual jihad. Flynn sees the jihadis as better organized than ever, battle-hardened from conflict against America and her allies in Iraq and Afghanistan, more willing and able to cooperate internationally than ever, and clearly capable of weathering the overhyped winds of democracy from the Arab Spring. One of the views that apparently put Flynn on the outs with Team Obama was his belief that jihad ideology cannot be effectively disabled by \\u201cdecapitating\\u201d the leadership of Islamist groups. That\\u2019s a notion very dear to current Administration thinking, because it allows them to posture as terrorism-smashers with light-footprint, low-risk operations, such as the ubiquitous drone strike. It also folds into the American political elite\\u2019s cherished notion of jihad as the hijacking of a great and peaceful religion by a tiny minority of extremists. Wipe out the big shots in that tiny minority with drone strikes, and the problem goes away!Except it\\u00a0didn\\u2019t\\u00a0go away. It\\u2019s getting\\u00a0worse.\\u00a0The jihadi ideology is clearly capable of surviving the demise of high-profile leadership targets. \\u201cDecapitation\\u201d strategies obvious aren\\u2019t going to be effective against China, North Korea, Russia, or Iran, included among Flynn\\u2019s list of threats and challenges.General Flynn seems to be in fairly good spirits about his retirement \\u2013 he modestly allows that he might have gotten \\u201ca little too far out in front of my headlights,\\u201d but seems to accept a bit of political turbulence as a natural consequence of his mission to shake things up. However, it is not comforting that such a prominent critic of clearly failed strategies is leaving the team. Flynn told Kitfield that anyone who thought terrorists were on the run after bin Laden\\u2019s death \\u201ceither doesn\\u2019t know what they are talking about, they are misinformed, or they are flat out lying.\\u201d That covers everyone involved with President Obama\\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign. Does it cover everyone in the intelligence community who can still get the President\\u2019s attention?\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 275319}"
