"{\"title\": \"Frum Forum Blogger Embarrassed His Mother Has Political Opinions\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"So in a blog post at FrumForum (it\\u2019s like Penthouse Forum, minus the sex), a writer details a phenomenon called \\u201cFox Geezer Syndrome.\\u201dIt\\u2019s when your elderly parents become politically energized, thanks to watching so much Fox News.Richmond Ramsey, a pseudonym for \\u201cwussface,\\u201d slams his mom, thusly:\\n\\n\\u2026It wasn\\u2019t that I disagreed with their opinions \\u2013 though I often did \\u2013 but rather that I found the vehemence with which they expressed those opinions to be so off-putting.And so your parents are embarrassing reactionaries, cuz they chose Beck over Oprah.Look, Ramsey has a point \\u2013 for many people Beck has been an energizing influence. But he hasn\\u2019t turned the elderly into pitchfork-waving neanderthals. Some, thanks to Beck, are reading more, and buying more books. And some are investing in food storage. I bought an underground trampoline made of gold.The gist in this condescending piece: your parents are stupid because they are easily swayed by tv. And because they never had strong opinions before, their current emotional state must be manufactured. Unlike, of course, their more sophisticated offspring \\u2013 who are young, pragmatic and smart. Pop\\u2019s just cranky, old and reactionary.And of course, the blogger must bring up the Tuscon shooting. Yep, maybe you should worry about mom and dad, since, \\u201cpassion is the enemy of clear thought and\\u2026the prerequisite for mob rule.\\u201dMan, what a dumb thing to say about the folks who gave you life and raised you.And who might also drop you from the will.And if you disagree with me, you sir are worse than Woodrow Wilson.Tonight:  Mike BakerJonah GoldbergAngela Maglowan\", \"article_id\": 189631}"
