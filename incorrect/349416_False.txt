Robots have been killing jobs for years according to a recent report by economists at MIT and Boston University. From\\u00a01990 to 2007 between three and 5.6 workers lost their jobs for every robot added to the economy. And it gets worse. By 2025 there could be a 0.94 to 1.76 percentage point decline in the employment-to-population ration. MarketWatch\\u2019s Steve Goldstein does the math\\u2014around 3.3 and 6.1 million jobs lost. In May an EU representative suggested adding new corporate reporting requirements on their robot and AI usage; data that could possibly lead to new taxation. Robert Shiller, a Yale economics professor, analyzes the idea\\u00a0in The Guardian. \\u201cA moderate tax on robots, even a temporary tax that merely slows the adoption of disruptive technology, seems a natural component of a policy to address rising inequality,\\u201d he concludes. \\u201cRevenue could be targeted towards wage insurance, to help people replaced by new technology make the transition to a different career.\\u201dThe vision is (not necessarily) the thing.\\u00a0Entrepreneurial\\u00a0success does not exactly come through\\u00a0holding an unwavering vision for the business, according to a new study on startup success rates.\\u00a0The University of Chicago and Stanford Graduate School of Business studied choices made by entrepreneurs in over 4,500 software startups over 12 years, concluding that founders willing to adapt their business and products to find the right market usually did the best. That practice, they found, even applied to Mr. Visionary CEO himself, Apple Inc.\\u2018s Steve Jobs as well as Facebook Inc.\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg. \\u201cThese \\u2018geniuses\\u2019 \\u2014 we think they knew, but they didn\\u2019t,\\u201d one of the study\\u2019s authors, William P. Barnett of\\u00a0Stanford\\u2019s Graduate School of Business, tells Insights by Stanford Business. But what they did know was how\\u00a0to put together systems \\u201cthat could discover the future, that allowed for uncertainty, that ferreted out possibilities. Then they doubled down on those discoveries.\\u201dBeware\\u00a0the CEO who brags about the Burning Man orgy dome.\\u00a0Earlier this year Miki Agrawal, founder and former CEO of women\\u2019s underwear startup Thinx, discovered that the let-it-all-hang out vibe learned on the playa does not play in the office, even one that swaddles its high-tech underwear in \\u201csocially\\u00a0conscious\\u201d marketing. Ms. Agrawal stepped down following charges by employees that her\\u00a0\\u201cmanagement\\u201d\\u00a0style encouraged\\u00a0a hostile work\\u00a0environment, and one \\u201cwith\\u00a0occasional nudity on Agrawal\\u2019s part,\\u201d\\u00a0Quartz\\u2019s Aimee Groth adds. \\u201cInstead of hiring an HR person, policy and hiring decisions were reportedly more fluid and based on Agrawal\\u2019s whim,\\u201d she writes.\\u00a0Employees too were miffed with their CEO\\u2019s\\u00a0confessional\\u00a0post on Medium, where she wrote about her experience in an orgy dome at Burning Man.\\u00a0\\u201cThe Times They Are a-Changin\\u2019,\\u201d someone once sang (not at Burning Man, though) and \\u201cworkers are increasingly skeptical of startups that highlight the work/purpose/play trifecta.\\u201d Ms. Groth writes.EVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOWThe U.S.\\u00a0national debt is on track to rise to 150%\\u00a0of gross domestic product by 2047, nearly doubling over the next three decades as President Trump continues to signal he intends to pursue policies that may drive deficits higher.
