"{\"content\": \"{\\\"SALT LAKE CITY \\u2014  It was only at the end of the debate \\u2014 after arguments over city rail service, policing and homelessness \\u2014 that Jackie Biskupski nodded to how her mayoral run could make history here in Utah\\u2019s capital.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhen I was elected to the Utah Legislature, that was no cakewalk,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was the first openly gay elected official, and there was a lot of hard work that needed to be done then, and there\\u2019s a lot of hard work that needs to be done in our city today.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Biskupski, who is in a close race against Salt Lake City\\u2019s two-term incumbent, will become the city\\u2019s first openly gay mayor if she wins the election on Tuesday. She and Mayor Ralph Becker, both Democrats, are running on a nonpartisan ballot.\\\",\\\"It often surprises visitors to learn that Salt Lake City, the headquarters of the Mormon Church, where returning missionaries receive cheers at the airport, is also home to a rollicking gay pride parade, a gay-friendly men\\u2019s choir and a boutique hotel offering guests a \\u201cgay power package.\\u201d People sometimes describe the city as a rainbow island surrounded by a very red state.\\\",\\\"Now, as the Mormon Church and many conservatives in Utah grapple with how to address the legal victory ofsame-sex marriage, three candidates from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community are running for local offices. They are embroidering their calls for better roads and more small-business loans with personal stories of encountering discrimination and fighting for equal rights.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThere are those who want to hold me back because I\\u2019m a single mom,\\u201d Ms. Biskupski, 49, said in an interview at her campaign offices. \\u201cThere are those who want to hold me back because I\\u2019m a lesbian. It says a lot about the people here and how we\\u2019ve evolved as a community that I am where I am today.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Last week, the crowded conference rooms of the downtown Grand America Hotel offered a glimpse into the contrast between this city\\u2019s broad liberal streak and the conservative views on abortion,same-sex marriageand gender issues that form the bedrock of many smaller towns in Utah.\\\",\\\"Thousands of people from around the state and world gathered at the hotel for the World Congress of Families, a conservative gathering whose speakers embrace traditional marriage and oppose abortion. To loud applause, speakers urged audience members to fight rulings on same-sex marriage that had \\u201cput a lie into the law.\\u201d Some warned of ties between homosexuality and pedophilia. One mother said she had been met with shouts when she stood up to ask how the faithful might embrace gay relatives like her son.\\\",\\\"Outside the hotel, protesters stood in the rain on Thursday night, waving rainbow flags and signs, and gave speeches condemning the conference.\\\",\\\"But this kind of cultural clash has been conspicuously absent in local elections in which gay candidates are running against straight ones.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe most surprising thing about this campaign is how little emphasis there has been on the sexual orientation of these candidates,\\u201d said Jim Dabakis, a gay state senator who endorsed Ms. Biskupski. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of gay people and straight people on both sides.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Biskupski and Mayor Becker are tangling on questions of public safety and who is the better choice to sustain Salt Lake City\\u2019s booming economy and spread the benefits of gleaming, glassy downtown development to struggling corners of the city.\\\",\\\"Ms. Biskupski has won support from Democrats who called her an inspiration for people who have traditionally been marginalized in Utah\\u2019s politics. But several leading gay-rights advocates have endorsed Mr. Becker,hailing himas a \\u201cstraight ally\\u201d who fought for anti-discrimination ordinances and created a \\u201cmutual commitment registry\\u201d for gay couples when state laws did not recognize any same-sex unions.\\\",\\\"They said his advocacy had helped pave the way for a statewide ban on housing and employment discrimination, including for sexual and gender identity, that won support from Mormon leaders and the Republican-led Legislature.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt is important to consider more than personal characteristics when casting your vote,\\u201d the activistswrote inendorsingMr. Becker in an opinion piece in The Salt Lake Tribune.\\\",\\\"Ms. Biskupski beat Mr. Becker by 15 percentage points in the election\\u2019s five-way first round in August, but recent polls have the race a dead heat.\\\",\\\"Ms. Biskupski says the city is not doing enough to deal with a growing homeless population or to bring growth to neighborhoods on its west side. Mr. Becker, 63, argues that Salt Lake is in cultural and economic bloom, with a vibrant restaurant scene, a new performing arts center, refurbished parks, more bike lanes and 3 percent unemployment.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe city is doing well,\\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \\u201cI want to take advantage of that momentum and really finish the job.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In a race for the City Council, Derek Kitchen, a lead plaintiff in the court case that overturned Utah\\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage, is campaigning on a platform to help small businesses. He is a founder of a business that sells Middle Eastern foods, and he has met with the government-relations staff at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to discuss economic development in his downtown district.\\\",\\\"\\u201cPeople look at me as someone who did something that was unfathomable a year before,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"In the suburb of Midvale, an old lead-smelter town where office parks now spring up, Sophia Hawes-Tingey, who would become the first transgender elected official in the state, is campaigning for the City Council on a platform including street repairs and better communication between voters and City Hall.\\\",\\\"She moved to Utah five years ago, chasing work as a software engineer, and decided to run after serving in a volunteer resident group. For weeks, she has been knocking on doors in her 2,000-person district, introducing herself to neighbors and asking what they want from their local government.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI was afraid I\\u2019d lose supporters because of ingrained cultural beliefs,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat turned out not to be the case.\\u201d Of her gender, she said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s part of who I am, but it\\u2019s not the core and central piece of my campaign.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Her incumbent opponent, Paul Glover, operates a garden center and truck-accessory business and is running on his experience and his family\\u2019s deep ties to the town. He said that the race had drawn outsize attention \\u2014 he had never been asked for an interview before this race \\u2014 but that it boiled down to experience.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI have experience, and she doesn\\u2019t,\\u201d Mr. Glover said. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t matter who she is. It\\u2019s whether she can do a better job for Midvale. The rest of it doesn\\u2019t matter.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 342088, \"title\": \"Gay Candidates Find Support, or at Least a Shrug, in Salt Lake City\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
