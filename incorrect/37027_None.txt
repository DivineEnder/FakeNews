"{\"title\": \"Kerry: There are moderates in Syria\", \"content\": \"Secretary of State John Kerry says there is a \\u201cmoderate\\u201d opposition force the United States is supporting in Syria and that supporting those groups will counteract murderous rebel forces like those pictured in a shocking execution video.Kerry sat down for an interview with MSNBC\\u2019s Chris Hayes on Thursday, and was asked if men in a video obtained by The New York Times, which shows an execution by rebel forces in Syria, would become our \\u201callies\\u201d if the U.S. takes action in Syria.\\u201cNo. In fact, I believe that those men in those videos are disadvantaged by an American response to the chemical weapons use because it, in fact, empowers the moderate opposition,\\u201d Kerry said.( PHOTOS: Syria: Where politicians stand)The secretary said there are 11 \\u201creally bad opposition groups\\u201d that the U.S. knows about who are not being supported by the U.S. or its allies, who are providing assistance to other forces.\\u201cThat is a moderate opposition. They condemn what has happened today,\\u201d Kerry said. \\u201cAnd we are busy separating the support we\\u2019re giving from any possibility of that support going to these guys.\\u201dKerry reiterated the administration\\u2019s position, though, that any military intervention would be limited to reacting to the Syrian regime\\u2019s use of chemical weapons, and will not be about taking out Syrian President Bashar Assad.\\u201cThe president is not asking Congress to authorize him militarily to engage in that transition. He wants to enforce the almost century-old prohibition against the use of weapons. Would that have some downstream impact on Assad\\u2019s military capacity? Sure, but the purpose of that is to exclusively deal with chemical weapons,\\u201d Kerry said.( WATCH: Latest developments in Syria)After that, the U.S. and its allies will continue to support the \\u201cmoderate opposition\\u201d groups in \\u201ca fight that will go on for some period of time without the United States of America being engaged in that fight directly,\\u201d the secretary said.Kerry also dismissed criticism of himself and the administration by members of the previous administration that led the war in Iraq.\\u201cIt just doesn\\u2019t make a difference to me, because they\\u2019re so discredited by their own judgments that it\\u2019s hard to see they have a judgment today that is relevant to this,\\u201d Kerry said. \\u201cFrom the moment that I had been sworn into office, I\\u2019ve been working \\u2026 to guarantee that we are not presenting to the American people the same shoddy intelligence that was presented to the American people back in Iraq, that we do not make that mistake, that we will not put American boots on the ground.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 37027}"
