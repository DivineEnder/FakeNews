"{\"article_id\": 176146, \"content\": \"Remember Audi\\u2019s absurd \\u201cGreen Police\\u201d Super Bowl commercial where green cops arrest citizens for using plastic bags, plastic water bottles and sort through the community\\u2019s trash cans to ensure they\\u2019re recycling? Well, the absurdity is about to hit the streets of Cleveland.\\n\\nCleveland.com reports,\\n\\n\\nThe high-tech collection system is an expansion of a 15,000-resident pilot program that commenced in 2007. Proponents of the program argue that not only is the $2.5 million program good for the environment, but because the city will collect revenue from the fines and from recycled goods, the trash police will eventually raise revenue.The article mentions that the city pays $30 per ton to place garbage in a landfill but would receive $26 per ton for recycling goods. We know that the city will pass the costs onto the consumer, but the article makes no mention of whether residents will reap any savings benefits.Much more problematic is the intrusion onto individual liberties. Like much of the \\u201cGreen Police\\u201d commercial\\u2013and the environmentalist movement as a whole\\u2013the goal is to change human behavior. But a recent Rasmussen survey \\u201cshows that only 17% of adults believe most Americans would be willing to make major cutbacks in their lifestyle in order to help save the environment. Most (65%) say that\\u2019s not the case.\\u201dSkeptics of catastrophic temperature increases compare belief in global warming to a religion, saying that alarmists base their views on faith much more than concrete science. This could have significant consequences if Congress enacts cap-and-trade legislation or other policies that aim to increase Americans\\u2019 energy bills. The goal, of course, is to force consumers to use less energy.We should allow for choice and respect the choices of others. If someone chooses not to drink bottled water because they believe it is bad for the environment, so be it. (Interestingly, the environmentalist push that tap water is unsafe led to the rise of bottled water.) Those who choose to drink tap water should respect the preference of those who enjoy bottled. Conflicts will certainly arise among people with different preferences, but to advocate that one is morally right and one is morally wrong is objectionable.\", \"title\": \"Green Police Becomes a Reality in Cleveland\", \"source_id\": 2}"
