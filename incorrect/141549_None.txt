"{\"title\": \"Erdogan and the Islamic State Oil Trade: Is Turkey Funding Terrorism?\", \"content\": \"This alarming revelation follows Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov\\u2019s\\u00a0accusation earlier this month that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his family are \\u201cinvolved\\u201d in ISIS\\u2019s illegal oil trade and personally benefiting from it. Should Erdogan be profiting from ISIS oil, he would be caught in a public lie \\u2013 one which Erdogan has already promised to resign over.ISIS\\u2019s main funding comes from two sources: donations from wealthy Gulf \\u201cangel investors\\u201d and its illegal oil trade. According to Szubin, ISIS has earned as much as $500 million, at a rate of $40 million a month, from selling this oil. ISIS\\u2019s black market trade has been a major force in tumbling crude prices which fell this past Thursday to $35 a barrel and caused the Dow to plunge 300 points.It is clear that Erdogan shares many of ISIS\\u2019s goals. One of ISIS\\u2019s chief rivals in Syria are\\u00a0Kurdish militias. These militias seek independence from Syria and, if successful, would lead to Turkey\\u2019s Kurds gaining increased confidence in its own dispute with Erdogan. This past summer, \\u201cErdogan was enraged when Kurdish forces in Syria liberated the town of Tel Abyad from ISIS, and the Turkish military drew up a plan to invade Syria, not to fight ISIS but to set up a 30-kilometer-deep buffer zone to prevent the Syrian Kurds from controlling their own home country.\\u201d Erdogan threatened that he \\u201cwould never allow the establishment of a [Kurdish] state on its southern border in the north of Syria.\\u201dErdogan believes Kurdish independence in Syria is more of a threat than ISIS. This explains why a video released this past September showed a Turkish train carrying war tanks and weapons which were being delivered to ISIS to help repel the Kurdish advance in Tel Abyad. It is also in Erdogan\\u2019s interest for Turkey to at least facilitate ISIS\\u2019s oil trade so ISIS can finance its hostilities with the Kurds.Also on Thursday, an Erdogan ally filed a criminal complaint in Ankara Public Prosecutor\\u2019s Office against Vladimir Putin and Antonov for \\u201cinsulting the President\\u201d and \\u201cdefamation.\\u201d The complaint states that the Turkish government \\u201ccannot turn a blind eye to defamation against our President by other Presidents or officials.\\u201d Perhaps the Turkish government will next file charges against the American Szubin?It is clear that Erdogan can control Turkey\\u2019s borders when it is in his interest. He just bribed the European Union for over $3B with the promise that the Turkish military will better monitor the flow of migrants into Europe through its western border with Bulgaria and Greece.The larger implication of Szubin\\u2019s revelation is that the US government has for the first time publicly stated\\u00a0that Turkey is buying ISIS\\u2019s oil. And it came just weeks after Putin accused Erdogan of shooting down the Russian fighter jet to \\u201cprotect ISIS\\u2019s oil trade.\\u201dTurkey, a NATO member, may be ISIS\\u2019s strongest military ally. And Turkey could be using US weapons to protect ISIS\\u2019s interest. If Erdogan is indeed profiting from ISIS\\u2019s oil trade, he is not only endangering American lives but doing so on the back of the US taxpayer.If the Obama administration\\u2019s goal is to dismantle and destroy ISIS, then it is time for our president has a frank discussion with Erdogan. And Turkey\\u2019s NATO membership should be re-examined.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 141549}"
