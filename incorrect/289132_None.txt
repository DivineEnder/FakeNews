"{\"content\": \"In an\\u00a0announcement outlining his plan to grant as many as 206,000 Virginia felons voting rights, McAuliffe said his office is mailing voter registration cards directly to felons the Virginia Supreme Court ordered banned\\u00a0from voting, along with individual registration orders printed with a signature\\u00a0from the governor. The governor\\u2019s website does not mention the direct mailing of voter cards\\u00a0in its outline explaining how he plans to proceed with his plan to restore felon voting rights.The move is a transparent bid to boost Democratic turnout in an important swing state. Seven out of ten convicts register as Democrats, according to a 2014 jail survey. Mass immigration from the Third World and non-Western nations has also dramatically transformed Virginia in only a decade, turning\\u00a0it from a once-red state into the next possible Democratic stronghold, similar to California. McAuliffe running the governor\\u2019s office as a voter registration drive for Democratic voters could possibly help\\u00a0tip the scales in Hillary Clinton\\u2019s favor.It also has other disruptive, long-standing consequences: Hundreds of thousands of felons will be free to serve on juries, run for office, and work as notaries. There are no exceptions when it comes to violent and destructive criminals. Murderers, rapists, kidnappers, child abusers, drug traffickers, burglars, those convicted of aggravated assault \\u2014\\u00a0none of them are excluded from McAuliffe\\u2019s order if they are no longer in prison and on parole. The Democratic governor\\u2019s office has also\\u00a0\\u201cmistakenly\\u201d given\\u00a0voting rights to high-profile child sex abusers and\\u00a0murderers in its rush to direct\\u00a0enormous numbers of convicted criminals into the voting booth.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 289132, \"title\": \"Clinton Ally Terry McAuliffe Mailing Voter Registration Cards Directly to Thousands of 'Invalidly Registered' Felons\"}"
