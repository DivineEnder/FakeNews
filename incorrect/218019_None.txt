Ironically,   another 60 percent believe that when NATO forces withdraw the country will descend into civil war.    The survey is based on interviews with 5,000 Afghans in five provinces in late September. The Adenauer Foundation is a highly respected German organization.Those who continue to believe that there exists a universal yearning for democracy might want to reconsider.\", \"article_id\": 218019}"
