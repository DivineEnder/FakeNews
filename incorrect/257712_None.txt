Upon this discovery, the widow pushed to have Arafat\\u2019s body exhumed so tissue samples could be taken: and tested.The goal was to find out if someone (read Israel) had poisoned the late Palestinian leader.Then two weeks ago, Arafat\\u2019s nephew Nasser al-Kidwa voiced staunch opposition to exhuming the body. Kidwa argued that Palestinians were already certain Israel had poisoned Arafat, so there was \\u201cno justification\\u201d for digging up his remains.\\u00a0In the end, Suha and Kidwa both got their wishes. The grave was opened and samples were taken, but the body was not exhumed.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 257712}"
