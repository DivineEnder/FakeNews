And behind the scenes, because some agents thought that things weren\\u2019t moving fast enough, they started believing conspiracies that, perhaps, politics were at play. And back here at headquarters in Washington, there was an effort to try to make sure that the agents had what they thought they had \\u2014 that they had the goods to bring some kind of investigation, to make it a full-blown investigation. It turns out that a lot of what they had, Carol, was based on this book called \\u2018Clinton Cash.\\u2019 It was published by Peter Schweizer, and he\\u2019s now an editor at Breitbart. But a lot of the allegations in there have not been substantiated. The FBI headquarters here in Washington and Justice Department prosecutors thought that the agents needed to do a lot more work. So, what you have is a lot of misunderstanding and a lot of innuendo as to what exactly was going on, Carol.\\u201d(h/t Real Clear Politics)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"article_id\": 207055}"
