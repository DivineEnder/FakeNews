Ergo listing those as priorities one, two, and three. But why let mere numbers get in the way of \\u201cJews are too busy \\u2018making money\\u2019 to embrace negotiations?\\u201dAnd obviously the West Bank Arabs with whom the Israelis are negotiating are very explicitly not Arabs who \\u201cused to live on this land,\\u201d insofar as they\\u2019re Arabs who \\u201care living on this land\\u201d right now. That\\u2019s in sharp contrast to the descendants of Jews who were expelled from Arab lands, and who are being left out of the \\u201ccomprehensive\\u201d peace talks. But why let all that get in the way of eliminationist, anti-Israel themes?This greediness image has actually been percolating in news magazines for quite a while. Similar to media reports of Israeli organ harvesting and water poisoning, it\\u2019s seemingly an explicit echo of a classically anti-Jewish canard. But that kind of historical baggage is undoubtedly a coincidence, which is also why Newsweek felt comfortable trotting this out in January:\\n\\nIn fairness, this is more \\u201cIsraelis are uninterested in peace because they can\\u2019t get rich from it\\u201d than \\u201cIsraelis are uninterested in peace because they\\u2019re already getting rich elsewhere.\\u201d Though you\\u2019d think that continuing Arab hostility toward the Jewish state as such would dominate any analysis of Israeli burnout, as opposed to how it financially impacts those Israeli Jews who spend their time fantasizing about getting rich. Apparently not so much.Elsewhere in that Newsweek article: an exegesis on how Israel\\u2019s \\u201cprovocations and abuses, including the continued expropriation of Palestinian land, the dramatic growth of Jewish settlements in the 1990s and the siege Israel has imposed on Gaza,\\u201d are ignored in Israeli accounts of Palestinian terrorism and Gaza rocket fire. An explanation for that ostensible cognitive blind spot \\u2013 something unpacking how Intifada II happened after Israel offered to uproot those settlements, or how the Gaza siege was imposed only after years of that Palestinian shelling \\u2013 was excised, perhaps on account of length.Anyway, back to that Time piece. There\\u2019s an argument to be made that the balance of the Newsweek article is about Israeli resilience rather than intransigence, and that the money stuff is just a deeply symptomatic aside. Time, not so much:Which is weird, because just a year ago Time was explaining how Israelis would never achieve quiet if they continued \\u201cpunishing Hamas.\\u201d The magazine\\u2019s insistence mirrored earlier media condescension about Israel\\u2019s security barrier: \\u201csuicide bombers will just climb over it \\u2013 duh!\\u201d The cover for that \\u201cpunishing Hamas\\u201d article, by the by?At the time some people suggested that the cover was some kind of typical \\u201cJews = Nazis\\u201d slur, where the barbed wire imposed on the Star of David was some kind of concentration camp allusion. Other people insisted that Time would never stoop so low as to equate Israeli tactics and Nazi tactics. June 1982:A few more charming Time covers in that vein are here and here. How genuinely pleasant it is to realize that, even in our era of media upheaval and disintegration, there\\u2019s still some consistency to be found in the world of journalism.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 270397}"
