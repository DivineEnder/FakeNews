"{\"title\": \"In Wake of Chattanooga Terror Attack, Provocative Gay Hate-Flag Must Come Down\", \"content\": \"Did the gay rainbow flag provoke Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, the 24 year-old naturalized American citizen born in Kuwait who murdered four Marines and a Sailor \\u00a0Thursday, to commit his heinous crime?Abdulazeez, who was shot and killed by police Thursday, was a devout Muslim. And one thing we know about devout Muslims is that many vehemently oppose same sex marriage and consider homosexuality a sin.Back In May, two mad dog Muslims attempted to murder everyone at a free speech event in Texas. Because good guys with guns were present, only the terrorists were killed.Nevertheless, the media claimed that the Draw Muhammad Cartoon Contest and its organizer Pam Geller provoked the attack.For weeks, both Geller and satiric free speech were blasted in the media for offending the Muslim faith\\u00a0 and by extension causing a terror attack.Just last month, a mad dog racist murdered nine innocent people in a South Carolina church. For weeks, the mainstream media blamed a flag \\u2014 for weeks the media coordinated a shaming campaign against what many see as a symbol of hate and oppression.The gay rainbow flag is seen by many Christians as a symbol of hate and oppression \\u2014 and for good reason. Under that banner, there has been an all-out assault by the media and the Left against our religious freedoms. Under that banner, on the same day of the Chattanooga terror attack, a Jewish man was physically threatened in person and on social media by Inside Edition\\u2019s Zoey Tur, a man who identifies as a woman.Moreover, the defiant act of flying of the gay rainbow flag, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling that legalized same sex marriage in all 50 states, is undoubtedly offensive to devout Muslims, and therefore provocative.It is time to shame and marginalize the gay rainbow flag \\u2014 this offensive, provocative symbol of hate and oppression must be tossed on the ash bin of history\\u2026Before it kills again.\\u00a0Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 276723}"
