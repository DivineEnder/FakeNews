"{\"title\": \"'Dennis Miller: The Big Speech' Premieres Tonight on HBO -- Plus a Bill Maher Flashback\", \"content\": \"\\u2014\\u2014\\nYesterday I wrote about Sam Kinison  and how today\\u2019s rampant political correctness  likely would\\u2019ve destroyed any opportunity he might have had at the same  career today. Afterwards, while  digging up the promo for Dennis Miller\\u2019s HBO special tonight, I came across the video below with   Miller and Bill Maher from 2002 where they cover the exact same topic. In light of what\\u2019s happened since to Don Imus, Juan Williams,  Bill O\\u2019Reilly on \\u201cThe View,\\u201d and the pause heard \\u2019round the world  on Maher\\u2019s own \\u201cReal Time,\\u201d 2002 suddenly looks like the good ole\\u2019 free-wheeling days of stand up comedy, doesn\\u2019t it?\\nThe context of their discussion surrounds Maher losing his \\u201cPolitically Incorrect\\u201d gig on ABC after making this statement just a few days after the September 11th attacks:\\n\\n\\u201cWe have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from two thousand miles away. That\\u2019s cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly.\\u201d\\n\\nIf you remember, Rush Limbugh was one of Maher\\u2019s most vocal defenders after the remark  blew the controversy up into something that was likely the cause of ABC not renewing Maher\\u2019s contract.   I\\u2019m not sure I would categorize that as censorship \\u2014 ABC has the right to ask someone to leave for any reason they want \\u2014 but his general point about arguing with him instead of telling him to  shut up is exactly right. And anyone who\\u2019s read Big Hollywood for any period of time knows how much we love to argue with  Bill Maher.\\n\\u2014\\u2014-\\nBe sure to check out Miller\\u2019s special tonight. We weren\\u2019t able to find any clips, but we will have more in the coming days.  \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 190244}"
