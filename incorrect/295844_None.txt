Diamond Dogs (@BenedictKMiller) March 22, 2016Well #StopIslam is trending. To be followed shortly by Twitter artificially stopping #StopIslam from trending.\\u2014 Caleb Howe (@CalebHowe) March 22, 2016And then it disappeared\\u00a0for some users; it is no longer trending in the \\u201cWorldwide\\u201d or United States trend lists, though the hashtag is still at the top of the list of trending topics for many European countries including the UK, Germany, France, and Belgium.#StopIslam is gone for me. Just vanished out of thin air. pic.twitter.com/Cy95pRY4sK\\u2014 Charlie Nash (@MrNashington) March 22, 2016Oh look #StopIslam isn't trending now, just like that.\\u2014 Chris Pur (@Crisprtek) March 22, 2016How can #StopIslam be #1 UK trend yet vanish from USA? Surely not Twitter censoring the hashtag? pic.twitter.com/xNBBipG0jc\\u2014 Martin Daubney (@MartinDaubney) March 22, 2016Twitter has censored the #StopIslam hashtag. It is no longer appearing in trending topics.\\u2014 Milo Yiannopoulos \\u2718 (@Nero) March 22, 2016Yes, #StopIslam is censored. See, this is why I do not like this site anymore. They censor the truth. #RIPTwitter\\u2014 The Trigger Man (@fedupwithpccrap) March 22, 2016The commissars at the Twitter \\\"Truth and Safety\\\" council have now censored #StopIslam from worldwide trends. pic.twitter.com/zKyREsMcmr\\u2014 Tom Dan (@TomDanTheRock) March 22, 2016@twitter @Support just censored the #StopIslam hashtag, which was trending in the USA.\\u2014 Swanson Nation (@SwansonNation) March 22, 2016Twitter may have attempted to incorrectly auto-complete\\u00a0the hashtag when it is searched or typed, some users have highlighted..@MrNashington Charlie \\u2013 I just saw this. They have changed the #StopIslam autocomplete to a typo. pic.twitter.com/FXl1PtgSew\\u2014 Lyle Yiannopoulos (@Lyde15) March 22, 2016This is a common trick used by Twitter to quickly slow down and diminish a hashtag, and has been used with numerous controversial hashtags before. The result is users being tricked into using a completely separate misspelt hashtag that means the original hashtag gets cut off from new additions without the mistake being entirely noticeable to the poster. In this case Islam has been auto-changed to Isalm, a subtle difference.Journalist and Broadcaster Martin Daubney also highlighted the fact that Twitter\\u2019s display of \\u201ctop tweets\\u201d for the hashtag weren\\u2019t actually the top tweets. Only tweets that fit the political narrative were displayed at the top.The \\\"top tweets\\\" on #StopIslam aren't actually the top tweets, but the ones that fit the narrative pic.twitter.com/MANIAmwIuf\\u2014 Martin Daubney (@MartinDaubney) March 22, 2016As of writing this story, the hashtag has since returned to its number one position for \\u201cWorldwide\\u201d trends. This may intersect with Daubney\\u2019s discovery that tweets expressing condemnation of\\u00a0the hashtag are practically pinned to the top whenever you search for it, regardless of how many likes less they have than their pro-#StopIslam counterparts.Twitter has become so erratic and unpredictable, with their frequent censorship and anti-free speech rhetoric, that it is\\u00a0causing users to distrust the platform. They\\u2019re afraid to be shadow banned for displaying the wrong political affiliation, and they\\u2019re afraid of being suspended for making innocuous jokes to the wrong person. Users are even afraid about what features Twitter will introduce, regardless of whether anyone wants them, because as evident in the past CEO Jack Dorsey has not been entirely truthful with his userbase. There is no trust anymore, and they\\u2019re spending their time making birthday \\u201clike\\u201d animations instead of addressing these problems.Charlie Nash is a frequent contributor to Breitbart Tech and former\\u00a0editor of the Squid Magazine.
