"{\"title\": \"UFC Featherweight Chad 'Money' Mendes Contemplates 'Moneyweight' Fight\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"The UFC featherweight remains undefeated against fighters not named \\u201cJose Aldo.\\u201d After knocking Ricardo Lamas onto queer street on Saturday, Mendes has faced and defeated nearly everyone who\\u2019s anyone at 145: Cub Swanson, Clay Guida, and Nik Lentz to name three.So, would Money consider imitating his Team Alpha Male stablemate Urijah Faber and accept a superfight outside of his weight class? It\\u2019s called the \\u201cmoney\\u201d division, after all.\\u201cThat\\u2019s something I think I could probably do,\\u201d Mendes tells Breitbart Sports. \\u201cI\\u2019d have to just change up my camp a lot as far as what I am doing diet-wise and training. It\\u2019s not something I really want to do. But I think I possibly could. But if there\\u2019s a superfight and if the money\\u2019s right, I would definitely think about doing it.\\u201dThe stocky Mendes notes that he thinks he can cut down past 145 until about two pounds out, when he tells himself, \\u201cScrew that.\\u201d Though the question included the idea of either moving up or down, Mendes refrained from calling out, say, an Anthony Pettis, and instead fixated on the idea of shedding pounds instead of adding them.Few fights remain for Mendes at featherweight. Dennis Bermudez, Frankie Edgar, and Conor McGregor would make sense if their dance cards weren\\u2019t punched. July\\u2019s Aldo-McGregor bout complicates matters further for Mendes. Should Aldo win, an outcome predicted by Money, Mendes may be locked out because he has twice faced and failed against the champ. Should McGregor win, Aldo has reigned as such a dominant champion that a rematch would be a near certainty, which would also lock the Californian out.Mendes recognizes the conundrum.\\u201cI\\u2019ve been trying to figure out who I would fight after this, if I were to go out there and beat Ricardo,\\u201d Mendes explained after doing just that. \\u201cThe only thing that makes sense in my mind is back for that title.\\u201dUnfortunately for Mendes, the third try for the title in four years that makes sense in his mind may not make sense in Jose Aldo\\u2019s or Dana White\\u2019s.\", \"article_id\": 161234}"
