"{\"content\": \"All are\\u00a0AR-15s, and all five can be relied upon to deliver the shooting experience that owners of AR-15 rifles have come to love through the years.Bushmaster XM15-E2S\\u00a0\\u2014 This is a classic AR-15 with no accessories. It is a great AR for those purists who want the old, fixed buttstock \\u2014 nothing adjustable here \\u2014 and a fixed rear sight as well. The rear sight aperture is adjustable, but the sight itself is built into the carry handle, thus fixed. The gun has a 20-inch barrel, is accurate, and is certainly durable.The XM15-E2S weighs 8.6 pounds.The XM15-E2S is no longer in the Bushmaster catalog, but a used one can be acquired for around $750.Smith & Wesson M&P15 Sport \\u2014 The Sport is somewhat of a throwback AR, in that the style is very basic. Apart from the Magpul rear sight and telescopic buttstock \\u2014 which lets you choose between 6 different positions for rifle length \\u2014 the Sport is pure old-school AR without any bells and whistles. It does come with a 30-round magazine, but beyond that, the Sport\\u2019s key characteristics are dependability, accuracy, and durability.As for durability, while it is smart to clean and maintain your firearms regularly, the Sport, which I had shot for an extended period of time, appeared not to care less. The gun operated flawlessly, regardless of whether it had or had not been cleaned at proper intervals.The Sport weighs 6.45 pounds.Because the Sport is bare bones, it is one of the more affordable ARs on the market. Suggested retail for a new Sport is $739.Colt LE6920 \\u2014 The Colt LE6920 is a civilian version of the Colt M4, a gun countless military personnel have relied on for safety during times of war and tumult. The LE6920 comes with a Magpul rear sight and various other Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) parts \\u2014 including\\u00a0MOE SL handguards, MOE SL carbine stock, MOE SL pistol grip, and MOE vertical grip. The buttstock is position adjustable, like the stock on the Smith & Wesson M&P15 Sport.The LE6920 weights 6.9 pounds.Many AR-15 fans view the Colt as the only AR they will own because of the company\\u2019s rich history with the military. That is certainly another selling point for the rifle. The gun is extremely accurate and a pleasure to shoot.Suggested retail on a LE6920 is $999.SIG516 Patrol \\u2014 Sig Sauer\\u2019s 516 Patrol comes with a SIG adjustable buttstock and a SIG grip and handguard. It has flip-up adjustable iron sights, front and rear, and comes with a 30-round magazine. The 516 Patrol handguard is aluminum and presents\\u00a0four M1913 Picatinny rails where various accessories can be added \\u2014 lights, lasers, a vertical tactical grip, etc.The SIG516 weighs 7.3 pounds.The 516 Patrol is accurate and smooth in its operation. It is more refined than some of the other ARs on this list, and the price reflects that. The price on a new 516 Patrol is approximately $1250 to $1299.Daniel Defense DDM4 V1\\u00a0\\u2014 The V1 takes AR-15 refinement to the next level. Whereas the Bushmaster\\u00a0XM15-E2S is at one end of the spectrum \\u2014 capturing the essence of the AR-15 for the shooters who are purists \\u2014 the V1 is at the other end of that spectrum, demonstrating everything an AR-15 can be in the hands of a person well-acquainted with it and trained in tactical usage.The V1 is also just a heck of a lot of fun to shoot.Daniel Defense makes their own accessories/furniture for their rifle, so the V1\\u2019s buttstock is made by\\u00a0Daniel Defense, as is its pistol grip, rail panels, handguard, sights, flash suppressor, etc. The V1 is a precision weapon and you know it as soon as you pull the trigger.The V1 weighs 6.7 pounds.Suggested retail on the V1 chambered in 5.56 is $1799.00.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
