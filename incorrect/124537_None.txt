"{\"title\": \"Media Spins Obama's Embarrassing Royal Toast\", \"content\": \"Obama embarrassed himself (and our nation) once again, this time while toasting The Queen of England.   Stranded at a former state dinner setting without his teleprompter, Obama tried to turn a toast into a speech with note cards, talking over the playing of England\\u2019s National Anthem.\\n\\n[youtube pNRXGRFJdDY]\\nSome in Make-Believe Media are downplaying the event as an awkward flub,  a miscue owed to Obama\\u2019s completely understandable lack of experience with royalty (those in the  stuffy, uptight British sphincter control set), or perhaps  as an isolated, \\u201ckinda weird\\u201d  incident.\\nOthers are playing  the liberal blame game spin tactic: blame  anything or anybody but Obama and his White House incompetents.    Jet lag,  minor memory lapse, or an overindulgence in elegant lifestyle (too many vacations?).   Heck,  blame the band for interrupting Obama by simply doing what protocol dictated.\\nBut Rush Limbaugh called the  best  spin so far:  Blame the Girl.   Yep, blame the Queen  herself  for snubbing Barry\\u2019s own ignorance of protocol.   Check out the Tuscon Citizen\\u2018s lede \\u201cQueen snubs Obama\\u2019s Toast at State Dinner.\\u201d    Compare the title of the video above to this one posted by  NewsReelDemocracy who chose to entitle the moment  \\u201cQueen humiliated Obama\\u201d   instead of \\u201cObama embarrassed Queen with long-winded toast.\\u201d\\n\\n[youtube 7ZCsfyaOGdw]Following up on the Blame the Girl spin angle, why  hasn\\u2019t the MSM hasn\\u2019t started asking  about the qualification of Ambassador Capricia Penavic Marshall in Office of the Chief of Protocol at the State Department?    According to its own official state website, the Office of the Chief of Protocol describes some of its myriad functions as follows:\\n\\nApparently, Ms.  Marshall is no stranger to orchestrating these diplomatic screw-ups in the Obama White House.   You know,  like that cool iPod  loaded with show tunes that Obama gave to the Queen of England, or that swell boxed set DVD movies Obama gifted to the legally blind British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the ones that he couldn\\u2019t  see in England (even if he were sighted) because their formatting is a mismatch for U.K. players?   Credit  to  The Washington Examiner writer Mark Hemmingway for asking just such tough questions two years ago.So you\\u2019ve gotta wonder how long it\\u2019ll take the media to throw Ms. Marshall under the bus to save Obama\\u2019s public image as a president who can\\u2019t even get a toast right.      Just who IS this girl assigned the task of advising President Obama on how to totally irritate our allies at state dinners?   Why are we paying her anything?   Why does she still have a public sector job?Because it can\\u2019t just be  Obama\\u2019s  total and utter lack of qualifications.   Anything to obscure the fact that he\\u2019s employed above his pay grade.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 124537}"
