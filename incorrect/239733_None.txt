"{\"title\": \"Sore Losers: Piers Team Mock Shapiro on Twitter After Debate\", \"content\": \"\\u2014\\u2014In summation: This is how CNN senior producers treat guests who don\\u2019t roll over and play dead: Look over here! Over here! Don\\u2019t look at the humiliating drubbing our blowhard took last night. Because-because-because Ben Shapiro doesn\\u2019t like Jack Nicholson! and thought Romney would win! and is no fan of Colin Powell! Hahahahaha! What an idiot, right\\u2026? This means everything he said last night is wrong, right? Right?What\\u2019s especially funny about this is that, after 15 hours and a full night to sleep on it, the entire CNN media-complex still can\\u2019t come up with an intellectually honest rebuttal to the points Shapiro made last night. So rather than accept defeat like adults, CNN senior producers choose to start publicly hurling non sequiturs covered in mud. And it wasn\\u2019t just this one senior producer. Morton Downey Jr. Piers Morgan himself got into the act:\\u2014\\u00a0Is this really the kind of shop Jeff Zucker, the newly installed head of CNN, wants to run? Is this the \\u201cnew\\u201d CNN: A bunch of unprofessional crybabies who pose as objective journalists have a bad night and then start hurling rocks after the invited guest has turned his back? Maybe Zucker thinks CNN\\u2019s future is to ape MSNBC. Good luck with that.\\u00a0Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 239733}"
