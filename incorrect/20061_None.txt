But his dour assessment of the American moment at the 92nd Street Y event on Manhattan's Upper East Side carried a tinge of disappointment that has come to color the end of the beginning of the Obama presidency.Axelrod also offered an impromptu endorsement to Wiesel's suggestion that a planned Islamic Center near the World Trade Center site be replaced by an interfaith center.\\\"It goes to the soul of our country\\u00a0\\u2014 that sourness is something that is understandable in these kind of times,\\\" said Axelrod, who arrived in Washington with Obama's promise of a new tone in public life. \\\"I think one of our great missions is to regenerate that sense of possibility that has always characterized the spirit of our country.\\\"Neither Axelrod nor Wiesel, who is famous for his historical, political\\u00a0and theological\\u00a0meditations on the Holocaust, which he survived, explicitly compared the moment to Germany between the two world wars, but both appeared to suggest an echo in the politics of a bad economy.\\\"We've seen in our history and the histories of other countries\\u00a0\\u2014 sometimes in tragic ways\\u00a0\\u2014 what happens when there is a sense of economic distress and how it divides people,\\\" Axelrod said.\\\"There is a new political fanaticism that I believe is dangerous and unworthy of [the] noble American tradition,\\\" Wiesel said.Axelrod cited as a particular example of that the attacks on Obama's citizenship.\\\"The things that were said about Thomas Jefferson were more than slanderous\\u00a0\\u2014 but there wasn't a deligitimazion of [earlier U.S. leaders] as Americans in most cases,\\\" Axelrod said. \\\"It's not all limited to the right, but there's a penchant for characterizing people as socialists, as fascists, even invoking Hitler.\\\"Axelrod also invoked the recent controversy over plans to build an Islamic center two blocks from the World Trade Center site, and the American tradition of religious tolerance.\\\"It doesn't feel like people are as tolerant right now,\\\" he said, and then offered his support to Wiesel's proposal for a compromise on the proposed lower Manhattan Islamic center.Wiesel, 82,\\u00a0said his solution would be to affirm to Imam Faisal Rauf that \\\"I know your intentions are good\\\" but that his plan would \\\"hurt some people who have suffered.\\\"\\\"Let's turn it around\\u00a0\\u2014 let's do it together. Jews, Christians and Muslims together will create this place, a center for interfaith, but sponsored together, financed together, worked out programs tighter, and show a symbol of solidarity, of religious solidarity,\\\" Wiesel said. \\\"It can become a very great symbol here\\u00a0\\u2014 a great monument for humanity.\\\"\\\"That sounds like a wonderful idea,\\\" Axelrod replied, saying it\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"gives me hope.\\\"\", \"source_id\": 1}"
