"{\"title\": \"Tripp testifies in Lewinsky scandal, June 30, 1998\", \"content\": \"On this day in 1998, Linda Tripp began testifying before a federal grand jury on what she knew about a sexual relationship between Monica Lewinsky and President Bill Clinton. Both Lewinsky and Clinton also subsequently went before the grand jury to answer questions, although Clinton appeared via closed circuit television.Tripp became Lewinsky\\u2019s confidante while they both worked in the Pentagon\\u2019s public affairs office. Earlier, both women had worked in the Clinton White House. After Lewinsky told Tripp about her relationship with the president, Tripp began to secretly record their phone conversations while encouraging Lewinsky to document the affair.In January 1998, Tripp, in exchange for immunity from prosecution, gave the tapes to Kenneth Starr, an independent counsel who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing by Clinton. Tripp also told Starr that Lewinsky had executed a false affidavit denying the relationship and revealed to him that Lewinsky had a navy blue dress that was soiled with Clinton\\u2019s semen.After a final round of interrogation, the grand jurors offered Lewinsky a chance to offer any last words. \\u201cI hate Linda Tripp,\\u201d she said. Starr compiled an exhaustive report, which was made public and eventually served as the basis of Clinton\\u2019s impeachment trial.On Jan. 19, 2001, the last full day of the Clinton administration, Tripp was fired from her Pentagon post. Tripp\\u2019s attorneys charged that her dismissal was \\u201cvindictive, mean-spirited and wrong.\\u201dIn 2003, the government settled a lawsuit charging the Defense Department with having violated the Privacy Act by leaking information from Tripp\\u2019s employment and security files. The settlement included a payment to Tripp of more than $595,000, a retroactive promotion and retroactive pay for 1998, 1999 and 2000. She also received a pension and was once more cleared to work for the federal government, although she declined to do so.SOURCE: \\u201cTHE DEATH OF AMERICAN VIRTUE: CLINTON VS.
