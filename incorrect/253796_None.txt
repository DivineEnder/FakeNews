On November 14, the Pope called heaven \\u201ca party.\\u201d He said it is \\u201ca true feast, and it begins now.\\u201dFrancis returned to the topic of heaven this morning. Despite the bad weather, Francis invited his hearers to contemplate the beauty of the afterlife. \\u201cWhen we turn toward this horizon,\\u201d the Pope said, \\u201cwe realize that our imagination stops, barely able to perceive the splendor of the mystery that surpasses our senses.\\u201d\\u201cGod is preparing a new dwelling place and a new earth where justice will abide,\\u201d he said \\u201cand whose blessedness will answer and surpass all the longings for peace which spring up in the human heart.\\u201dWe are on \\u201ca continuous journey,\\u201d Francis continued, \\u201ctowards the final, wonderful goal that is the kingdom of heaven.\\u201d The goal toward which the Church strives, he added, is \\u201cthe new Jerusalem.\\u201d More than a place, he said, \\u201cit is a state of soul in which our deepest longings will be fulfilled abundantly\\u201d and our being will \\u201ccome to full maturity.\\u201d\\u201cWe will finally be clothed in joy, peace and love of God in a complete way, without any limit, and we will be face to face with Him!\\u201d he said.Francis said that it is beautiful to see how there is \\u201ca continuity between the Church in Heaven and the Church that still journeys on earth.\\u201d Moreover, he went on, \\u201cthose who already live in the sight of God can indeed support us, intercede for us and pray for us.\\u201d\\u201cFrom the Christian perspective,\\u201d the Pope continued, \\u201cthe distinction is no longer between those who are already dead and those still living, but between those who are in Christ and those who are not! This is the decisive factor, truly decisive for our salvation and for our happiness,\\u201d he said.Citing Saint Paul, Pope Francis said that \\u201ccreation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.\\u201d\\u201cThe whole universe will be renewed and will be freed once and for all from all traces of evil and from death itself,\\u201d the Pope said. This will not be \\u201can annihilation of the universe,\\u201d but will bring \\u201ceverything to the fullness of being, truth and beauty.\\u201d \\u201cWhen we think about these wonderful realities that await us,\\u201d the Pope concluded, \\u201cwe realize that belonging to the Church is truly a wonderful gift, which carries within it a lofty vocation!\\u201dThomas D.
