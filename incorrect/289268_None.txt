"{\"article_id\": 289268, \"content\": \"This article first appeared in National Review:I am part of the tiny fraction of the population that deals professionally in public policy from the right. In influence, we are all over the map, from talk-show hosts with audiences of millions (Limbaugh, Hannity) to politicians who directly shape policy (Ryan, McConnell) to academics who write technical papers read exclusively by their peers. We have been dubbed the \\u201cRepublican Establishment\\u201d during this campaign season \\u2014 bemusing to those like me who have trivial influence and are not even Republicans \\u2014 but I\\u2019ll use Establishmentarians as a convenient label for who we are. This note is addressed to my fellow Establishmentarians, from the Hannities and Ryans to my fellow ink-stained wretches.Barring a startling turn of events, Donald Trump is going to be the Republican presidential nominee. There are good reasons to question his fitness to occupy the presidency, because of both his policy positions and for reasons of character. The standard response among the Establishmentarians who have announced they will vote for Trump is that \\u201cHillary is even worse.\\u201d That\\u2019s acceptable for people whose only obligation is to cast a vote. Having to choose the lesser of two evils is common in American voting booths. But that shouldn\\u2019t be good enough for Establishmentarians.If we\\u2019re going to presume to lecture others about public policy and good governance \\u2014 as all of us have made a career of doing in one way or another \\u2014 we need to put our views about Donald Trump on the table now, before the nomination and election. That\\u2019s especially true of the False Priests and the Closet #NeverTrumpers \\u2014 labels that I owe to Jonah Goldberg.The False Priests are the columnists, media pundits, public intellectuals, and politicians who have presented themselves as principled conservatives or libertarians but now have announced they will vote for a man who, by multiple measures, represents the opposite of the beliefs they have been espousing throughout their careers. We\\u2019ve already heard you say \\u201cHillary is even worse.\\u201d Tell us, please, without using the words \\u201cHillary Clinton\\u201d even once, your assessment of Donald Trump, using as a template your published or broadcast positions about right policy and requisite character for a president of the United States. Put yourself on the record: Are you voting for a man whom your principles require you to despise, or have you modified your principles? In what ways were you wrong before? We require explanation beyond \\u201cHillary is even worse.\\u201dYou can read the rest of the story here.\\u00a0\", \"title\": \"National Review: Why 'Hillary Is Even Worse' Doesn't Cut It\", \"source_id\": 2}"
