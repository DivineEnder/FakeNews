"{\"content\": \"{\\\"You took over at \\u201cFace the Nation\\u201d from Bob Schieffer, who is the longest-\\u00adrunning moderator of a Sunday network news show, in 2015. What advice did he give you?He told me to stick to the news. Everybody\\u2019s attention is shredded with all kinds of different distractions. You definitely see lots of efforts to reinvent and pitch a new model and redesign Coke, and that leads to lots of strange journalism. It sometimes leads to great journalism, but his advice was to stick to what people want to know.\\\",\\\"You\\u2019ve interviewed Donald Trump 19 times, including eight times in which he called in to the show instead of appearing live.I think it\\u2019s more important to have that news out there, whether it comes by phone or by semaphore flags or by any other method. The last time I interviewed him on the phone, he said that he was open to profiling Muslims. That\\u2019s news!\\\",\\\"This hasn\\u2019t been done for other candidates, though. Hence the criticism that the bar was lowered for him because he\\u2019s such a ratings-\\u00adgenerating machine.If the others don\\u2019t want to talk, then that\\u2019s on them. In a lot of cases, Trump was the only one who would talk on any given Sunday. Talking to the press is not always good. Donald Trump seems to think it is, but most of his opponents didn\\u2019t. He was getting more airtime, but he was also the only one who was as available as he was. Is there something about having him on the phone that gives him an advantage? Is he looking at a fact sheet, and people can\\u2019t see? Or is there something in his facial expression that they\\u2019re missing? For him, that\\u2019s not as much a concern as it would be for another candidate.\\\",\\\"What has been the toughest, most uncomfortable question that you\\u2019ve asked?When I interviewed John McCain in 2000 about whether he had taken medication for his anger. I remember thinking, Let\\u2019s see how this is going to work.\\\",\\\"There\\u2019s a Washington Post article that says your colleagues began referring to \\u201ccleverly worded, seemingly harmless but incisive\\u201d questions as \\u201cDickersonian.\\u201d These sorts of questions are what you\\u2019re known for, but do you consider them your best interview moments?I just interviewed Mitt Romney at the Aspen Ideas Festival, and I asked him a couple of questions or a series of questions about his dad \\u2014 his hero \\u2014 who had been part of the Stop Goldwater movement. I like those. There\\u2019s the human side of people who are in public life that connects people. Whether it\\u2019s favorable or unfavorable, it gives them some connection with the person who\\u2019s onstage, and I think those connections are edifying.\\\",\\\"Do you mean those connections that we feel between ourselves as humans or our politicians as humans?Both. Not everybody gets a chance to go fly around the country and spend time in places with people who aren\\u2019t like them, where, again and again, you realize we\\u2019re all generally alike.\\\",\\\"I think that politicians, more than ever, would rather talk about whatever trivial personal connections they have than talk about policy, right?Yeah, but those questions have to be probing. They have to get at something real, and not just simply be a platform for self-\\u00adpolishing. When Hillary Clinton tells the story of her mother\\u2019s grit, it all may be true, but it\\u2019s obviously self-\\u00adserving. If you can excavate new and interesting stuff from politicians that\\u2019s not a part of the freeze-\\u00addried, prepackaged, soft-\\u00adfocus propaganda that politicians put out, if you can fight past all of that and get to what you think is a true thing, then I like trying to do that.\\\",\\\"Your colleagues say you have a healthy distance from Washington\\u2019s cocktail-\\u00adparty culture. Is that in part because you were raised in it?I think I have a distance from the cocktail culture because I drink alone.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 347393, \"title\": \"John Dickerson Is Tired of Politicians\\u2019 Propaganda\"}"
