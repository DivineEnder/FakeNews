"{\"title\": \"Book lauds Texas 'swagger'\", \"content\": \"Texas Monthly Senior Editor Erica Grieder\\u2019s new book, \\u201cBig, Hot, Cheap, and Right: What America Can Learn from the Strange Genius of Texas,\\u201d makes a compelling case that economically and politically, Texas gets a lot of things right.But not all the things that come out of Texas have such a good reputation \\u2014 including that famous Texas \\u201cswagger.\\u201d\\u201cAs we\\u2019ve seen with Rick Perry and George W. Bush, people kind of have a bad reaction to it,\\u201d Grieder told POLITICO. Too bad, she says.\\u201cI kind of enjoy it, however. I think it\\u2019s kind of hilarious.\\u201d And, besides, how is it any different than northeastern bluster? Of Chris Christie, Grieder says, \\u201cI think he\\u2019s a little bit of a belligerent but maybe I\\u2019m failing to appreciate the New Jersey strut or whatever people do up there.\\u201d( PHOTOS:  10 bluest, reddest states)Grieder says that, despite the state\\u2019s reputation as being a bastion of conservatism, Texas \\u201cis getting more purpleish,\\u201d but that shouldn\\u2019t excite Democrats too much.\\u201cIt\\u2019s almost inevitable that, at some point, Democrats will start to compete statewide again, but I\\u2019m not sure when and the question is how much they\\u2019ll resemble Democrats at the national level. \\u2026 I think the Democratic Party in Texas is more conservative and more business focused than the national party.\\u201dAlthough the Rick Perry\\u2019s 2012 presidential run didn\\u2019t go so well, Grieder says the governor seems unfazed.\\u201cThere was kind of a sense of blood in the water after he came back,\\u201d Grieder said. \\u201cHe was kind of quiet for a while.\\u201d But \\u201cI don\\u2019t think he seems terribly daunted by what happened. I would guess that he\\u2019s not going to run for reelection in 2014. He might be preparing for a presidential run again in 2016.\\u201dAs for the other Texas politician in the headlines \\u2014 Republican Sen. Ted Cruz \\u2014 Grieder calls his career path \\u201ca bit unusual even in a Texas context.\\u201d\\u201cBecause Perry\\u2019s been governor for so long, that kept a lot of the statewide Republicans in the same office for a long time and Cruz kind of jumped the line by about 50 spots when he went to the Senate,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI think he\\u2019s carving out a bit of his own path.\\u201d\"}"
