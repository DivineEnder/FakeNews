"{\"title\": \"In key pension case, justices seem unswayed by public workers\", \"content\": \"TRENTON \\u2014 The state Supreme Court on Monday appeared to question whether public workers have a contractual right to annual increases in their pension benefits after retiring, indicating the justices may rule in favor of the state in a case that would otherwise add billions of dollars to New Jersey\\u2019s unfunded pension liability.The Christie administration and retired public workers argued over a key cost-saving measure that was supposed to help shore up the state\\u2019s retirement funds after years of neglect. It's the second challenge to the law to reach the high court.The case comes down to whether the Legislature and Gov. Chris Christie had the legal authority to do away with retirees\\u2019 cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, which are tied to the rate of inflation. A freeze on COLAs was among the key components of the state\\u2019s landmark 2011 pension reform law, saving about $17.5 billion.The plaintiffs in the case \\u2014 several public sector unions and a group of retired prosecutors \\u2014 argued the state has a contractual obligation to pay COLAs, saying the increases should be considered a \\u201cnonforfeitable\\u201d right under a 1997 law that guarantees some pension benefits.Beyond that, it\\u2019s an issue of fairness \\u2014 that thousands of workers retired believing they would be able to count on the adjustments, Charles Ouslander, the lead plaintiff and a retiree, argued before the court.\\u201cIt\\u2019s inherently unfair to change the law \\u2014 not just in the middle of the game, but to change the score after the game is over,\\u201d said Ouslander, who worked for the Hunterdon County prosecutor's office. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s what\\u2019s happened here.\\u201dHe said the case exemplifies what the legal principle of \\u201cequity\\u201d is about. \\u201cIt\\u2019s to protect us from arbitrary actions of the state,\\u201d he said.But a number of justices seemed skeptical, notably Anne Patterson and Jaynee LaVecchia. Paterson questioned Ouslander at length on several occasions during the hearing, picking at his arguments about a \\u201cplain language\\u201d interpretation of the law.\\u201cWhy isn\\u2019t it a simple proposition that, under this very high standard that governs the contract cases \\u2014 and virtually every other type of statutory interpretation that this court or any other court would undertake \\u2014 that if there\\u2019s an ambiguity, it\\u2019s game over?\\u201d Patterson asked at one point.The case comes down to a seemingly simple question: Does the 1997 law apply to COLAs? Briefs arguing for both sides of that question stretch for dozens of pages. A state appeals court in 2014 ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, overturning a lower court decision in finding that the state broke the law by freezing COLAs.Both the state and the plaintiffs agree the \\u201997 law guarantees some pension benefits for retirees who paid into the system. The law says, in part, that those public employees \\u201cshall have a nonforfeitable right to receive benefits as provided under the laws governing the retirement system or fund upon the attainment of five years of service credit in the retirement system or fund or on the effective date of this act, whichever is later.\\\"The law also says, \\u201cnonforfeitable right to receive benefits' means that the benefits program, for any employee for whom the right has attached, cannot be reduced.\\u201dMuch of the plaintiff\\u2019s case hinges on whether the term \\u201cbenefits program\\u201d is meant to include COLAs. They argued that the Legislature only explicitly excluded health benefits, suggesting everything else is applied under the law.\\u201cThe very fact they saw fit to exclude health care benefits, which is their right, shows you that the phrase \\u2018benefits program\\u2019 is extremely broad,\\u201d Ouslander said.On the other side, assistant attorney general Jean Reilly argued that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would degrade the power of the state. That\\u2019s especially important in this case \\u201cbecause the stakes are so high,\\u201d she said.A loss would increase the unfunded pension liability by some 33 percent and, according to Moody\\u2019s Investor Service, \\u201cwould hurt New Jersey's pension fund cash flows and funded status and the state's ability to reach structural budget balance.\\u201dReilly told the court that the \\\"interpretation of the contract that plaintiffs urge would result in a drastic limitation of the power of the state \\u2014 the power to enact a legislative remedy to address a problem with which multiple stakeholders and the general public have a vital and keen interest.\\\"She added that the 1997 law \\u201cdoes not even mention COLAs, much less create an unforfeitable, contractual right to them.\\u201dOverall, the justices seemed more receptive to her arguments. But not all. Justice Barry Albin, who dissented in another case last year that upheld the 2011 pension law, seemed to show support for the plaintiffs. He appeared to be especially moved by arguments about the \\u201cplain language\\u201d interpretation of the 1997 law.\\u201cHow do you think normal people read this?\\u201d Albin asked Reilly. \\u201cHow are the citizens of the state, employees who work for the state or municipalities, supposed to guide their lives if they cannot read the statute and expect the plain language of the statute to rule the day? Do we expect them to go through thousands of pages of legislative history to try to divine the intent of the Legislature when the plain words seem to indicate something else?\\u201dA daily, morning briefing full of the scoops and storylines driving the conversation among New Jersey\\u2019s health industry insiders.A morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on New Jersey politics and policy.Matt Friedman's must-read briefing on the Garden State's important news of the day\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 26274}"
