Nor did he invent the assembly line. But more than any other single individual, he was responsible for transforming the automobile from an invention of dubious utility into an innovation that shaped the 20th century and continues to affect many lives today.Ford incorporated the Ford Motor Co. in 1903, declaring: \\u201cI will build a car for the great multitude.\\u201d In 1908, he did so, offering the Model T for $850. In the Model T\\u2019s 19 years of production, its price dropped to as low as $260. More than 15 million were sold in the United States alone.As an unintended consequence, the success of the Model T also accelerated the rise of industrial unions in the 1930s \\u2014 which Ford opposed \\u2014 as potent social and political forces. It spawned mass ownership of cars, thereby altering living patterns, leisure activities, the landscape and the atmosphere.Ford had opposed America\\u2019s entry into World War I and World War II. In 1939, Ford claimed that the torpedoing of U.S. merchant ships by German submarines stemmed from a conspiracy hatched by \\u201cgreedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction\\u201d \\u2014 his code word for Jews.He railed against President Franklin D. Roosevelt for supporting Britain in its conflict with Nazi Germany. Ford continued to do business with Hitler\\u2019s Third Reich, manufacturing war materials and employing French prisoners of war to work in Ford factories as slave laborers.However, once the United States entered the war, Ford directed his company to build a huge factory at Willow Run near Detroit. In October 1942, the first B-24 bombers came off what was then the largest assembly line in the world. At its peak in 1944, the plant produced 650 B-24s a month.SOURCE: U.S. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\", \"article_id\": 33098}"
