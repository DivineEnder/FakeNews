It won\\u2019t be about who ate a dog or kept one on the roof of his car.It won\\u2019t be about whether Barack Obama will protect the middle class against Mitt Romney\\u2019s predatory capitalism. And it won\\u2019t be about whether Mitt Romney will create jobs by eradicating Obama\\u2019s \\u201cEuropean socialism.\\u201dIt will be about who you like. (Or even whom.)Naive. Simplistic. Adolescent. Who people \\u201cwant to a have a beer with\\u201d is an insult to the intelligence of the American voter.These are the common criticisms of my view. Instead of likability, demographics rule political analysis today. Are you a Latino? A single mother? A gun owner? Gay? A college graduate? A suburbanite? A truck driver? That will determine your vote.(Though if you are a Latino single mother with a college degree who is a gay truck driver living in the suburbs with your gun, things get a little complicated.)Campaigning, in other words, does not fundamentally change elections because campaigning does not change the demographics of the electorate.Me, I do not buy this. I do not believe that demographics are destiny. I believe campaigns are about campaigning and the campaigners. And the campaigners have to get you to like them.Let\\u2019s look just at two campaigns in which an incumbent president was running for reelection.Way back in 1984, President Ronald Reagan was not a shoo-in against Walter Mondale. At 73, Reagan was the oldest president in U.S. history. And on Oct. 7 in Louisville, he stumbled through a disastrous debate, at one point admitting he was \\u201cconfused.\\u201d Nancy Reagan later would call it \\u201cthe worst night of Ronnie\\u2019s political career.\\u201dJust one more debate would follow 14 days later in Kansas City, Mo., and Reagan\\u2019s media guru, Roger Ailes, told Reagan to forget about all the facts and figures that his staff was trying to stuff into his head. \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t get elected on details,\\u201d Ailes told him.In the second debate, Reagan was warm, affable and got off the line of the evening. \\u201cI will not make age an issue of this campaign,\\u201d Reagan said. \\u201cI am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\\u2019s youth and inexperience.\\u201dMondale laughed along with the audience, but he later said tears of defeat had welled in his eyes. \\u201cIn the second debate, he was on his game,\\u201d Mondale said. \\u201cHe reassured the public, and that was essentially the end of the campaign.\\u201dIn 2004, George W. Bush ran for reelection against John Kerry. In the weeks before Election Day, there was a drumbeat of bad news for the incumbent: a rising death toll in Iraq, reminders of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, a shortage of flu vaccine, high gasoline prices and three badly reviewed debate performances. True, the Bush forces had \\u201cswift-boated\\u201d Kerry, but the attacks, which were baseless, would not have damaged Kerry so much if people had simply liked Kerry more as a person, trusted and respected him.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
