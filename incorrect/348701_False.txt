It is also why he spent 36 minutes at Lebanon High School here urging people to vote for Mrs. Clinton and laying out why he believes thatDonald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is a \\u201cpathological liar.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cOn issue after issue, there should be no doubt in anybody\\u2019s mind as to whetherHillary Clintonis the superior candidate because in every respect she is,\\u201d Mr. Sanders said to the crowd of about 300 people. \\u201cI intend, as a United States senator, to do everything that I can between now and Election Day to make certain that Donald Trump does not become the next president of the United States.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But Lois Corcoran, a former Sanders supporter who plans to vote for Ms. Stein, said she refused to accept the idea that people must vote for Mrs. Clinton if they do not want to see Mr. Trump in office. She said it would not be her fault if the businessman is elected and is frustrated that Mr. Sanders will not back Ms. Stein, who she believes shares more of his ideas.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI feel very betrayed by him,\\u201d said Ms. Corcoran, 52, of Charlestown, N.H. \\u201cHe says it\\u2019s not the man, it\\u2019s the message, but yet he\\u2019s jumped over to the Democrats\\u2019 message.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In his speech, Mr. Sanders, sensing that some of his supporters were still weighing whom to support, stressed that no candidate was perfect and that the election was not about personalities but about the \\u201cneeds of the American people.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI am not the world\\u2019s most partisan person,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut the truth is, if you look at Donald Trump\\u2019s record, what you find is that this guy is a pathological liar.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Sanders also argued that voters should keep in mind that the next president will probably choose several Supreme Court justices and that Democrats will need a majority of seats in the Senate to pass legislation. Mr. Sanders, joined onstage by Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who is running for Senate, added that progressives would need to remain active after the election to get bills passed.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI would hope and ask you all, very much, that we have got to do everything we can to make sure that Hillary Clinton is elected president and that Maggie Hassan is elected to the Senate,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut two days after the election, we have got to continue the pressure.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Sanders was scheduled to hold four Labor Day events in New Hampshire and Vermont, during which he emphasized his support for Mrs. Clinton. But remaining tensions were plainly on display. A woman waved a sign that said \\u201cNo Corruption, No Clinton,\\u201d while another held a painting of Mr. Sanders that said \\u201c#StillBernie.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Will Coleman, 51, of Windsor, Vt., held a poster with Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s picture on it that read \\u201cCareer Criminal.\\u201d A former Sanders supporter, Mr. Coleman will be voting for Ms. Stein, he said, because he believes Mrs. Clinton is dishonest, will engage in international wars and has long supported unfair trade deals.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt crushed me thatBernie Sandersflipped over and he is campaigning for her,\\u201d Mr. Coleman said.\\\",\\\"Still, polls show that the majority of Mr. Sanders\\u2019s former supporters, like Lauren Glass, 22, plan to vote for Mrs. Clinton.\\\",\\\"Ms. Glass, a graduate student at Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H., was excited to see Mr. Sanders hit the campaign trail and use his platform to back Mrs. Clinton.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI was a very serious Bernie supporter,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI think at this point you just kind of have to face the reality of the situation and say: \\u2018Am I going to be nonparticipatory and exist in an ideal world and just not vote or write in a vote, a name? Or am I going to move toward progress even if that\\u2019s small and incremental rather than the leaps and bounds that you had hoped for and that Bernie represented?\\u2019\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
