"{\"title\": \"World View: Catalonia Parliament Votes to Secede from Spain\", \"content\": \"This morning\\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\\nMarta Rovira votes for secession from Spain in Catalonia\\u2019s parliament on Monday (Getty)Spain faces a new governing crisis after the parliament of Catalonia voted on Thursday to \\u201copen a process\\u201d to secede from Spain within 18 months.Spain\\u2019s prime minister Mariano Rajoy said that an appeal will be made to the Constitutional Court to invalidate the vote, adding \\u201cI understand that many Spaniards have had a bellyful of this continued attempt to delegitimize our institutions.\\u201d However, the Catalan politicians say that they will disobey Constitutional Court rulings. Irish Times and ReutersFor years, every event related to the Mideast \\u201cpeace process\\u201d has been bizarre in some way, and Monday\\u2019s was no exception.Visiting Washington, Israel\\u2019s president Benjamin Netanyahu said the following to President Barack Obama:I want to make clear that we have not given up our hope for peace. We will never give up our hope for peace.I remain committed to a vision of two states for two peoples, a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. I don\\u2019t think that anyone should doubt Israel\\u2019s determination to protect itself and defend itself against terror and destruction. But neither should anyone doubt Israel\\u2019s willingness to make peace with any of its neighbors who want to make peace with it.It is bizarre because of the fact that it was even necessary to say that there is a \\u201chope for peace.\\u201d This was necessary because of the intense personal hatred between Obama and Netanyahu, as reflected in\\u00a0unofficial remarks that occasionally leak out from either administration. A member of Netanyahu\\u2019s cabinet was recently reported to have said that Obama is anti-Semitic, which he and other Netanyahu administration members undoubtedly believe. And the Obama administration has frequently leaked accusations that Netanyahu personally is fully to blame for not reaching a peace deal with the Palestinians, which is why Netanyahu chose to make the statement about \\u201chope for peace.\\u201dWhen you zoom out to look at the entire \\u201cpeace process,\\u201d the desire for the two-state solution \\u2014 \\u201ca vision of two states for two peoples,\\u201d as Netanyahu put it \\u2014 is even more bizarre.In May 2003, President George W. Bush published his \\u201cMideast Roadmap to Peace\\u201d calling for the two-state solution \\u2014 a Palestinian state by 2005, side by side with Israel. The plan was sponsored by the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. It provided a series of steps for both sides to follow, mostly having to do with eliminating violence against both Palestinian and Israeli civilians. The solution was to be implemented by 2005.The 2003 plan was a adaptation of a Clinton administration plan. Since 2003, President Bush\\u2019s plan has been tweaked in various ways by both the Bush and Obama administrations, and presented each time as a new plan that would bring peace to the Mideast and joy to the world. And it has failed each time.You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize it will never work, and that trends in the Mideast are going towards war, not a peace process. In recent years, wars have begun in Libya, Yemen, Syria and Iraq; the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh) has risen in Syria, and has spread to other countries in the Mideast Northern Africa, Southeast Asia, and Russia\\u2019s Caucasus provinces. The new  \\u201cOslo Generation\\u201d of young Palestinians is using knives for random attacks on Israelis, and they declare that they have no use for their own leadership. Anyone can see that trend is away from a \\u201cpeace process\\u201d towards war.In 2003, there might have been some real hope that a peace deal could be achieved, but today, no one who follows the news could seriously believe that there is any chance the peace process would succeed. In fact, a White House spokesman said last week that the administration now believes that no peace deal will be reached before Obama leaves office:This is really the first time since the first term of the Clinton administration where we have an administration that faces a reality where the prospect of a negotiated two-state solution is not in the cards for the time that\\u2019s remaining. That was not the case until now.Well, this is unusual \\u2013 the Obama administration \\u201cfacing reality,\\u201d and saying so. And that makes Netanyahu\\u2019s statement on Monday even more bizarre, since \\u201ca vision of two states for two peoples, a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state\\u201d reflects no reality whatsoever.
