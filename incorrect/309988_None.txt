"{\"title\": \"Marvel Replaces The Hulk's Bruce Banner with a Korean Teenager\", \"content\": \"Banner, who was first introduced as the Hulk in 1962, is killed in the new comic by one of Hawkeye\\u2019s arrows, and Cho will take over as the alter ego of the character.\\u201cThis is uncharted territory for us,\\u201d claimed Marvel\\u2019s editor-in-chief Axel Alonso.\\u00a0\\u201cOnly two things are for certain: It will take a long, long time for our heroes to come to terms with his loss, and the circumstance surrounding his death will leave a huge scar on the superhero community.\\u201dJust last week, Marvel revealed that Iron Man\\u2019s Tony Stark would be replaced by a fifteen-year-old black girl, Riri Williams, and the two new character replacements this month act as Marvel\\u2019s next stage of creating social justice and diversification within the comic books.\\u201cFor all the people who seem really excited about Riri Williams, who\\u2019s going to take on the role of Iron Man, there were letters over the course of the week, which all said, \\u2018I am a long-time reader, I\\u2019m 50-something years old, why are you destroying all the characters that I love? I can\\u2019t find a character that looks like me anymore,'\\u201d said Marvel\\u2019s Senior VP Tom Brevoort. \\u201cBut the fact is you still don\\u2019t have to throw a dart to find a white male character in our publishing line.\\u201dWithin the past few years, Marvel has also made a female Thor and a black Spiderman, and the company has also taken to publishing comic books that include captions such as \\u201c[A lot of misogynistic filth]\\u201d, \\u201c[Red Pill MRA Meninist Casual Racism]\\u201d, and even \\u201c[Unsolicited Opinions on Israel???].\\u201d\\u201cFans may be outraged, and there are probably \\u2018Hawkeye\\u2019 writers who I\\u2019m very good friends with who will also be offended\\u2026 But the point is that everything that happens in this issue is in character when you discover the hows and whys and wheres,\\u201d said Civil War II writer Brian Michael Bendis.\\u00a0\\u201cWe\\u2019ll let people argue about it.\\u201dCharlie Nash is a reporter\\u00a0for\\u00a0Breitbart Tech.
