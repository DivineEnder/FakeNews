"{\"title\": \"Cuba and Venezuela Storm Out of Summit of the Americas Forum\", \"content\": \"While socialist-friendly Russia Today described the incident as the representatives of both nations \\u201cretiring\\u201d from the forum, meant to showcase various civil society groups on the eve of the arrival of heads of state, video from the incident shows Cuban and Venezuelan government agents blocking entry to the forum and heckling Cuban pro-democracy activists, including Guillermo Fari\\u00f1as, who has survived 24 hunger strikes against the Castro regime, and Ladies in White leader Berta Soler, who risk weekly arrests by attending\\u00a0Catholic Mass on Sundays.With chants of \\u201ckick them out!\\u201d representatives of alleged civil society groups approved by the Castro government demanded the removal of the pro-democracy activists, shouting insults at them and claiming they were \\u201cmercenaries\\u201d for the U.S. government.\\u201cWe as the civil society are defending what is ours, we cannot be in the same space,\\u201d Luis Morlote, a Cuban government supporter claiming to represent Cuban artists and writers, said to the Associated Press. The dissident groups were invited to the forum in March; their presence had been planned and public for weeks, making it possible for those who opposed it to simply not attend the forum to begin with, rather than walk out.Venezuelan government-approved civil society representatives also abandoned the forum in solidarity with the Cuban government. Venezuelan newspaper\\u00a0El Universal notes that the departure from the forum, which resulted in dozens of Cuban and Venezuelan agents blocking the entrance to the forum, \\u201cheated the atmosphere and slowed down the entrance for many of those invited to the forum from other countries.\\u201dThis is the first time in the history of the summit that the Cuban government has been invited, and already its representatives have been involved in two violent attacks on pro-democracy activists. In addition to the walk-out at the Civil Society Forum, Cuban government activists physically assaulted a group of activists\\u00a0who\\u00a0had come to lay flowers at a bust of Cuban revolutionary hero Jos\\u00e9 Mart\\u00ed in Panama City.The Summit of the Americas proper will begin on Friday, with President Obama scheduled to attend. The White House has said that Obama will \\u201cinteract\\u201d with Cuban head of state Ra\\u00fal Castro in some form, though it is not yet clear in what way. It is not yet known if President Obama will acknowledge the Cuban pro-democracy activists in attendance.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 273939}"
