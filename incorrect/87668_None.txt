His father, who also started as a reporter at the paper, was promoted to the Metro desk in 1981 before joining the publishing side.Staffers at every company water cooler tend to gossip about how much their boss's son deserves his promotion, but in this case it seems like the respect for young Sulzberger is widespread. Emails one Times staffer:Any Sulzberger who might run the paper someday would get a tour of duty throughout the paper's newsroom and operations. Editors in the building gush about how good he is, how he had a lot of smart A1 stories in the last year, how he's actually really f**king nice and has great story radar. I would imagine if he wasn't a Sulzberger, it might have taken longer but I don't think anyone begrudges him a move to editing. I think the newsroom wants him to be well prepared for his future.\"}"
