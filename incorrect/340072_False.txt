"{\"title\": \"Stakes High, Scott Walker Signs Wisconsin Budget\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Gov. Scott Walkersigned Wisconsin\\u2019s budget on Sunday afternoon, more than a week after the new budget year began and only hours before he was to announce his presidential campaign.\\\",\\\"The plan for spending more than $72 billion over the next two years brought a more contentious, extended fight among Mr. Walker\\u2019s fellow Republicans, who lead both of the state\\u2019s legislative chambers, than either of the two-term governor\\u2019s previous budgets. For Mr. Walker, it was an unwanted struggle in a year when nearly everyone in Madison was intensely aware of the stakes given his larger aspirations.\\\",\\\"In the end, Mr. Walker avoided raising sales and income taxes. He cut spending in the University of Wisconsin system by $250 million, and continued a freeze on in-state tuition. And the budget he signed permits an expansion of the state\\u2019s voucher program for students to go to private schools \\u2014 one of several fiscal elements likely to be highlighted by Mr. Walker as he tries to appeal to Republican primary voters after his expected presidential announcement on Monday.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWith this budget, taxpayers come first,\\u201d Mr. Walker said in a statement issued by his office late Sunday. He added, \\u201cThe budget I signed today again brings real reform to Wisconsin and allows everyone more opportunity for a brighter future.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Yet Mr. Walker lost on some substantive matters, including removing the public university system from state oversight and cutting an additional $50 million from the system. Some Republican lawmakers were outspoken in their critiques of Mr. Walker\\u2019s proposal, and some cast votes against the budget on the Assembly floor.\\\",\\\"Democrats were scathing in their reviews of the spending plan. They said too little was going to education, parks and roads, and pointedly noted Mr. Walker\\u2019s presidential aspirations, in one case describing him as a \\u201cpart-time\\u201d governor.\\\",\\\"\\u201cRather than selling out Wisconsin to advance Governor Walker\\u2019s presidential ambitions, we need to focus on ways to boost family wages and strengthen the middle class,\\u201d Jennifer Shilling, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said. \\u201cGiven the bipartisan opposition to this fiscally irresponsible budget, I hope that we can find common ground moving forward and invest in a brighter future.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Walker used line-by-line veto power granted to Wisconsin governors to make more than 100 changes to the budget approved by lawmakers \\u2014 a number some experts said was more than he had issued in the past. Among his changes, Mr. Walker removed a measure that would have given more authority to those in the payday loan industry.\\\",\\\"The state\\u2019s final budget includes a repeal of the state\\u2019s prevailing wage laws, which set prices for public construction contracts and are generally supported by labor unions. The matter had been debated at length for months, then added to the budget in the final weeks.\\\",\\\"Mr. Walker has made a national name for himself by sharply limiting collective bargaining rights to most public sector workers in 2011, and this year he signed a law barring companies from requiring workers to pay the equivalent of union dues.\\\",\\\"He pointed to the prevailing-wage repeal as a budget highlight on Sunday.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis Depression-era prevailing wage mandate artificially increases the cost of construction,\\u201d the statement from Mr. Walker\\u2019s office read. \\u201cUnder the repeal, local governments are exempted from this mandate, therefore saving millions for our schools, technical colleges and other local governments.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 340072}"
