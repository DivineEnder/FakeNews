"{\"title\": \"Genetic Research Scientist: Planned Parenthood Organ Harvesting \\u2018Beyond Kermit Gosnell\\u2019\", \"content\": \"Deisher \\u2013 who assisted the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) in its preparation to infiltrate Planned Parenthood and expose its practice of harvesting aborted baby parts \\u2013 responded to Breitbart News\\u2019 question about how the revelations in the investigative videos compared to what was discovered in convicted murderer Gosnell\\u2019s \\u201chouse of horrors\\u201d abortion clinic two years ago.\\u201cIt\\u2019s probably beyond that, and I would say beyond that because it\\u2019s so calculated for financial reward,\\u201d she said.\\u201cThe fetal liver is in high demand because during development, it\\u2019s the baby\\u2019s liver that makes their blood cells,\\u201d Deisher explained. \\u201cSo, instead of getting an adult to donate bone marrow \\u2013 so they can study how blood cells are made \\u2013 scientists will work with the aborted baby\\u2019s liver.\\u201d\\u201cIt\\u2019s much more convenient for that scientist to wait around until 10 a.m. and the liver\\u2019s delivered to their lab, rather than getting an adult donor and getting someone to take the sample,\\u201d she added. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a matter of convenience.\\u201dA renowned scientist in the field of adult stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine, Deisher asserts it is \\u201cabsolutely untrue\\u201d that there is no substitution for fetal liver.\\u201cPeople can say it as often as they want, and, unfortunately, when a lie is repeated over and over, people start to think it\\u2019s true,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd there is no example I can think of where embryonic or fetal tissue was necessary for any medical discovery that has been made. In the area of neonatal surgery, I would imagine there would be other sources for that material as well.\\u201dAs Breitbart News reported previously, Deisher \\u2013 who has 23 patents in her name and was the first person worldwide to identify and patent stem cells from the adult heart \\u2013 explained that because time is of the essence for biomedical researchers in harvesting fresh organs from aborted babies, some of them must be kept alive with a beating heart in order to get them through the harvesting of their organs.\\u201cThis is from reading their publications,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo, I have always suspected that the babies in some of these cases were alive until their hearts were cut out.\\u201dIn its newly released video on Wednesday, CMP reveals former StemExpress procurement technician and now whistleblower Holly O\\u2019Donnell describing how she was asked to cut through the face of an almost fully developed newly aborted baby boy \\u2013 with his heart still able to beat \\u2013 in order to harvest his intact brain.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 276056}"
