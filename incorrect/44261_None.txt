"{\"title\": \"Dr. Politics examines Hillary Clinton\", \"source_id\": 1, \"content\": \"Ask Dr. Politics! You are fair and I am unbalanced:Q: Hillary Clinton has 2016 locked up, right?A: No.Q: But she is such a favorite she will freeze out potential Democratic opponents!A: She will not freeze out potential Democratic opponents.Q: How come?A: Because she can\\u2019t. She was the favorite in 2008, too. She had the media coverage and the superstar status and the poll numbers all in her favor. But a guy named Barack Obama came along and ran anyway.Heck, in 2008 Hillary couldn\\u2019t freeze out Chris Dodd, Bill Richardson, John Edwards or Joe Biden. They all ran. Plus a bunch of others. The front-runner can always stumble, just like Hillary did.So don\\u2019t expect Andrew Cuomo, Martin O\\u2019Malley, Deval Patrick, Mark Warner, Antonio Villaraigosa or even Rahm Emanuel to stop thinking about tomorrow.Q: But Hillary has a stronger r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 now than she did in 2008. She was secretary of state for four years.A: And Biden will have been vice president for eight years as well as having been a U.S. senator for 36 years.Q: Biden! He\\u2019s too old to run in 2016.A: Maybe, maybe not. True, he would be 74 on Jan. 20, 2017, which would make him the oldest president to take the oath of office. But Hillary would be 69, as was Ronald Reagan, who is the oldest president ever to be sworn in. And Biden doesn\\u2019t project old.Q: Hillary will lock up all the money.A: Hillary won\\u2019t lock up all the money. Nobody can anymore. Even if you have a large number of bundlers \\u2014 and she would \\u2014 the Internet levels the playing field. The Internet is the greatest fundraising tool since the invention of moonshine. A candidate can raise millions and millions in a short amount of time. Ask Ron Paul.Q: But he lost. You need more than money. You need organization! Like Hillary had in 2008.A: Hillary had a lousy organization in 2008. She chose her staffers for their personal loyalty rather than their skill or experience.
