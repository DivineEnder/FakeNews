"{\"title\": \"Subject Says Ron Fournier Mischaracterized an Old Interview\", \"content\": \"In fact, Benson says he went out of his way to make clear to Fournier at the time that he was not talking about minorities. Fournier\\u2019s opening line, \\u201cA few months ago, I returned to my hometown of Detroit\\u2026\\u201d isn\\u2019t accurate, not unless 11 months count as \\u201ca few.\\u201d The article for which Fournier originally did this interview was published on October 6th last year. You can tell, because identical quotes appear in both pieces, though they are used to make different points. Obviously, last October was months before the primaries, meaning Brundage and Miller were not commenting about the election or with Mitt Romney\\u2019s ads in mind. \\u201cHe\\u2019staking an article that he wrote back in October and he\\u2019s linking it towhat Mitt Romney is doing now,\\u201d Benson told me.\\u00a0But rather than explain what he\\u2019s doing, Fournier leaves it to readers to wade through his past work to figure it out.The real core of Fournier\\u2019s piece is his translations of what his subjects said into what, he claims, they really meant. This is hardly a new idea, though it is not one usually associated with solid journalism. Decades ago MAD Magazine used to run ad parodies in which messages for familiar products were deconstructed into simple, often cynical language. It was the kind of pseudo-intellectual pose the magazine wasknown for, one which appeals to eleven-year-olds of every generation.Fournier essentially revives the MAD gimmick in yesterday\\u2019s piece to \\u201ccrack the code\\u201d behind the plain language used in the interview:I share this story to crack the code \\u2013 the subtle language ofdistrust and prejudice that whites use to communicate deep-set fears,and that cynical politicians translate into votes. Translating Millerand Benson:\\u201cSubsidization\\u201d = Welfare\\u201cGenerational Apathy\\u201d = Lazy\\u201cThey Slept All Day\\u201d = Blacks Sleep All Day\\u201cI Feel Like a Fool\\u201d = I\\u2019m Mad As Hell\\u201cThere\\u2019s no code,\\u201d Benson told me from his home in Michigan, \\u201cNone of this was saidby Dave and I. All of this code is his code.\\u201d\\u00a0Perhaps it\\u2019s time to reconsider the journalistic value of literally putting words in someone\\u2019s mouth? Fournier does the same trick with the text of Romney\\u2019s welfare ad a bit later in the article, and it\\u2019s these translations that make up the tent poles of his piece. Remove them and all Fournier has to offer are whispers from a few unnamed sources.For his part, Benson Brundage was not happy at being characterized as a bigot and a rude one at that. He notes, for starters, that he did not grab anything out of Fournier\\u2019shands as claimed in the piece. He \\u201cpolitely\\u201d asked if he could seethe survey results and Fournier handed them to him. It\\u2019s a minor point, but also the kind of thing a writer can use to characterize an interview subject. In this case, Fournier seems determined to make Brundage look bad.As Benson recalls it, the \\u201cdirection he [Fournier] was heading in was how blacks view the American dream vs. whites.\\u201d Indeed, that is the subject of the previous article. And because he and Miller were well aware they were discussing a racially tinged topic he says they both \\u201cworked overtime to make it clear that we were not talking about Blacks or Latinos.\\u201d In order to make this clear, Benson says he used Lake County, an area of northern Michigan which is overwhelmingly white (85 percent according to Wikipedia) as an example during the discussion. Benson told Fournier that some people stay busy in Lake county during the summer tourism season, then file for unemployment during the winter and \\u201csleep all day.\\u201d As a small government conservative, this is the kind of \\u201csubsidization\\u201d Benson says has a problem with. Benson was especially upset by the paragraph that comes immediately after the \\u201ctranslation\\u201d above. Fournier writes:Please understand that Miller and working-class whites like him havereason to be angry and cynical. First, life is tough and getting tougherfor the shrinking middle class, regardless of race. Second, as the National Journal reported\\u00a0inthe story involving Miller a year ago, minorities are steadily pushingtheir way into the middle class, which was once the province of whites. While Benson isn\\u2019t mentioned by name, the flow of the article and the catchphrase \\u201cworking-class whites like him\\u201d clearly includes him. But the idea that he is angry about the growth of a minority middle-class did not sit well with Benson.\\u00a0\\u201cI am not angry when minorities make their way into the middle class and that\\u2019s what this paragraph implies,\\u201d he told me. \\u201cI want nothing more than for minorities to make their way into the middle-class and beyond. And [Fournier] mischaracterized that.\\u201d At base, Benson disagrees that his (or Miller\\u2019s) comments had any racial subtext.\\u00a0\\u201cThere was nothing subtle about the language and nothing I said communicated distrust or prejudice toward minorities. My language communicated distrust and prejudice against the government\\u2019s motives in perpetuating these programs.\\u201d\\u00a0Like a lot of conservatives, Benson sees an underlying transaction wherein Democrats promise benefits in return for votes. The problem is that the system is unsustainable, something that cities and states across the country have been realizing recently.As the title of Fournier\\u2019s article suggests, he sets out to explain the Romney campaign\\u2019s racial subtext. But to get there he used some highly questionable tactics and, according to Benson, mischaracterized an 11-month-old interview on a somewhat different topic. By yesterday afternoon, Greg Sargent\\u00a0was hoping that Fournier\\u2019s reputation would help \\u201cmake this a safer topic among some of the top-shelf commentator and journalist types.\\u201d\\u00a0Based on my discussion with Benson Brundage, those commentators and journalists should probably think twice about climbing on this particular bandwagon.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 240602}"
