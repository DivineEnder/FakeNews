"{\"title\": \"Daily Gut: Eric Holder Sues Arizona, Forgives Black Panthers\", \"content\": \"Now, a lot of people have been hard on Attorney General Eric Holder. Whether it\\u2019s his fear of calling a terrorist a terrorist, his glib attack on the Arizona immigration bill (without ever reading it), or letting armed thugs off the hook in a voter intimidation case \\u2013 there\\u2019s a sense that Holder is a dude with scores to settle against a country that\\u2019s done nothing but open doors for him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2013But I disagree \\u2013 the fact is Holder is a brilliant man, who accurately predicted his very own behavior, back in February 2009. Remember, it was he who said, that the American people are \\u201d a nation of cowards\\u201d in failing to discuss race. He noted that \\u201ccertain subjects are off limits and that to explore them risks at best embarrassment and at worst the questioning of one\\u2019s character.\\u201dLet\\u2019s look at him now. When he had the Department of Justice dismiss the voter-intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party activists stemming from that 2008 incident in Philly, many wondered why. I mean, a dude standing in front of a voting booth, holding a baton intimidating voters? I don\\u2019t think he was there to sell tickets to band camp. It wasn\\u2019t that kind of baton. But for Holder, exploring that probably \\u201crisks at best embarrassment and at worst the questioning of one\\u2019s character.\\u201dWhatever \\u2013 Holder makes it clear that when it comes to racism, there\\u2019s one set of rules for whites, and another for blacks. And Holder know that prosecuting a racist \\u201cblack activist\\u201d just won\\u2019t play well at cocktail parties.So go after Jan Brewer instead. She didn\\u2019t break any laws, but she\\u2019s white and she\\u2019d never hit you with a baton (she probably packs heat).And if you disagree with me, you\\u2019re a racist homophobe who wears fur to tea party rallies.Tonight!John Gibson!Imogen LLoyd Webber!Constantine Maroulis!\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 191147}"
