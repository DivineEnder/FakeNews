"{\"title\": \"New York\\u2019s LED Streetlights: A Crime Deterrent to Some, a Nuisance to Others\", \"content\": \"{\\\"As dozens of families and friends crowded intoWilliam F. Moore Parkin Queens on a sweltering night last week, it was hard to tell what was louder: the cries of children who would not share their Italian ices from the Lemon Ice King of Corona, or the crash of bocce balls on the park\\u2019s floodlit court.\\\",\\\"Thump-thump-thump-thump CRACK!\\\",\\\"\\u201cEs rosa, es rosa!\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cNo, no, no, es green, es green!\\u201d\\\",\\\"There may have been little agreement on whose balls were closer to scoring, but everyone seemed to agree that the park was especially busy this summer \\u2014 and many agreed on why.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt used to be quieter, scarier, before they changed the lights,\\u201d Reuben Mendoza, who moved here from Mexico 19 years ago, said during a break.\\\",\\\"In May 2015, New York City\\u2019s Department of Transportation came to the Queens neighborhoods of Corona, Elmhurst and Jackson Heights to start replacing the old \\u201ccobra head\\u201d lights on major thoroughfares with new fixtures housinglight-emitting diodes, better known as LEDs. The light switch was proposed last decade, and will eventually encompass all 250,000 streetlights in the city\\u2019s five boroughs.\\\",\\\"The city undertook the changeover less to eliminate the jack-o\\u2019-lantern glow of the old high-pressure sodium lights and more for the benefits of LEDs. They are not only more efficient, but they also have a 15-year life span, which means less maintenance. The city expects to save $6 million per year on energy and $8 million a year on repairs.\\\",\\\"But the truer hues of the LEDs, which appear much brighter to the naked eye than the old lights, have other benefits.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI used to be afraid to go out at night with my kids,\\u201d said Stephanie Arias, who was sharing a park bench with her husband and two sons as they licked ices. \\u201cThere are a lot of stupid little guys around who like to start stuff. Now it\\u2019s different.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Yet where some now see better, others see only a nuisance. Residents of Corona may have embraced the LEDs as a crime deterrent and a pedestrian safeguard, but those in more upscale neighborhoods are fighting them. Many have argued that the lights\\u2019 rays blast through windows and ruin the charm of the night.\\\",\\\"From Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn to the West Village in Manhattan and Flushing in Queens, hundreds of grievances have flooded into official inboxes and switchboards as residentscomplain that the LEDs are harsh and hideous. Some say they cannot sleep at night.On Brian Lehrer\\u2019s radio showin May, Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to send out crews to turn down the lights where they present problems. \\u201cOnce again, the citizens know best,\\u201d the mayor, a Democrat, said. \\u201cThey were too bright in many cases, initially.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In underserved neighborhoods like Corona, though, \\u201ctoo bright\\u201d is exactly what residents want.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI haven\\u2019t gotten a single complaint,\\u201d said Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, a Queens Democrat. She had to spend $500,000 from her capital budget for the new LED lights on Roosevelt Avenue, which run beneath the elevated No. 7 train from 90th to 111th Street. She used to live on the avenue and knows how scary it can be, especially when the subway comes roaring overhead.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe can\\u2019t dim the entire city and have some places back in the dark again,\\u201d Ms. Ferreras-Copeland said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re out of the shadows and we don\\u2019t want to go back.\\u201d\\\",\\\"That might just happen. The City Council is considering a bill to lower the color temperature on the LED fixtures. This would reduce glare but also, perhaps, clarity. And after the Department of Transportation received 150 complaints last year, it began installing lower-powered lights: 72 watts compared with 78 watts.\\\",\\\"The differences are stark, even within a few miles.\\\",\\\"Last October, the author Lionel Shriver deplored the arrival of the lights in Windsor Terrace in anop-ed in The New York Times: \\u201cAs currently conceived, the D.O.T.\\u2019s streetlight plan amounts to mass civic vandalism.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Representatives for three Brooklyn community boards east of Prospect Park, covering Crown Heights, Flatbush and Brownsville, said that the new lights have been warmly welcomed with no complaints.\\\",\\\"Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, a Democrat who represents the Upper West Side, helped get a set of new LEDs on 86th Street switched off because they were beaming into residents\\u2019 windows. She said, however, that she also sympathizes with those communities clamoring for LEDs.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a good question, why, historically, has a district like mine and the Upper East Side been well-lit while others have not?\\u201d Ms. Rosenthal said.\\\",\\\"But many areas like the South Bronx and Upper Manhattan, communities that would presumably like to have the LEDs, will be last to get them.\\\",\\\"Installation has focused on areas like brownstone Brooklyn and stretches of Manhattan, including Central Park, and all 22,000 lights on the city\\u2019s highways, which were replaced in 2014. Brooklyn has received 95 percent of its roughly 61,000 new lights, compared with barely a third of Queens\\u2019 81,000 streetlights. There are thousands in Manhattan but almost none in the Bronx or on Staten Island, excluding the highways. A Transportation Department spokesman said this was simply a result of old contracting patterns. The lights have been installed at 1,000 dangerous intersections citywide as part of the mayor\\u2019s Vision Zero program.\\\",\\\"\\u201cConverting to LED street lighting is a big change for New York City, but has been embraced by most communities,\\u201d Polly Trottenberg, the city\\u2019s transportation commissioner, said in a statement. \\u201cWe have already found ways to reduce the brightness where needed, and D.O.T. is continuing to consider technological advances that will improve the character of LED lighting, making it more visually attractive.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Research differs on whether better lighting leads to a reduction in crime, thougha 2007 meta-analysisof 13 cities around the world, including eight in the United States, showed an overall reduction. \\u201cI believe in New York, you would expect to see a positive result,\\u201d said Brandon Welsh, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University who helped lead the analysis.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s actually less of a surveillance function,\\u201d he added, \\u201cthan people take pride and ownership of their community, so they can watch out for one another and police it themselves.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Ferreras-Copeland said the local police precincts had told her office that crime had decreased on the better-lit streets. But in an email, a Police Department spokesman said: \\u201cThere is no correlation between bright streetlights and lower crime rates. Police officers cannot speculate on hypothetical theories.\\u201d\\\",\\\"For Vincent Barbaccia, a co-owner of the Lemon Ice King for the past 13 years, there is nothing hypothetical about the lights. His stand used to be the only bright spot on the block, until last summer. \\u201cI had to tell them twice to turn the lights off\\u201d inside the shop, he said, \\u201cbecause I thought they were still on.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Many drivers \\u2014 or those on two wheels \\u2014 said they welcomed the improved illumination, too.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s light, and more light is good,\\u201d Angel Delvillan said while atop his bike on 108th Street. \\u201cAre people really complaining? Don\\u2019t they have real things to worry about?\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 347352}"
