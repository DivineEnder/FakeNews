"{\"title\": \"Fournier: WH Officials Say They're 'Disgusted' With Clinton Emails, Donation Disclosure\", \"content\": \"National Journal\\u00a0Senior Political Columnist and Editorial Director Ron Fournier said that White House officials tell him they\\u2019re \\u201cdisgusted with the fact that Hillary Clinton violated their rules on donations \\u2014 foreign donations, violated their rules on email,\\u201d but the White House is\\u00a0\\u201ccomplicit\\u201d in Clinton\\u2019s lack of transparency on Monday\\u2019s broadcast on MSNBC\\u2019s \\u201cMorning Joe.\\u201dFournier stated, \\u201cLook, the big \\u2014 the single biggest issue we have in politics right now is the public doesn\\u2019t trust politicians, doesn\\u2019t trust government. And it\\u2019s incumbent on our leaders, whether they\\u2019re Democrats, Republicans, Independents, to make sure they earn that trust, and Hillary Clinton, for all her strengths, is really undermining the trust, not just in her but \\u2014 and not just in the Democratic Party, but in politics in general. My view on all of these kind of stories is, you know, don\\u2019t presume guilt, don\\u2019t assume innocence, and follow the money. So, I would really like to know whether or not, and I don\\u2019t know, but I would love to know whether or not there\\u2019s in those emails, that we know we don\\u2019t have all of, that we know weren\\u2019t fully vetted, whether there\\u2019s any communications about the donors to the Clinton Foundation. And, you know, until we see \\u2014 until we know there\\u2019s been an independent vetting of her server, we\\u2019re always going to wonder whether or not there was a blur.\\u201dHe added, \\u201cWhite House officials tell me too they\\u2019re disgusted with the fact that Hillary Clinton violated their rules on donations \\u2014 foreign donations, violated their rules on email. Well, I haven\\u2019t heard the president rebuke her. I haven\\u2019t seen his State Department investigate this. So, I got to assume that the Obama White House is complicit in this lack of transparency and in this\\u00a0rule-breaking and whatever else might be going on that we don\\u2019t know about yet.\\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 200490}"
