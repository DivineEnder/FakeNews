"{\"title\": \"WATCH: Russell Brand Blames Capitalism and Fox News for Germanwings Crash\", \"content\": \"In his latest video, the activist comedian says that 50 percent of people will suffer from a mental illness at some point in their lifetimes, asking: \\u201cWhy is it happening all the time? Why are we living in the times of a mental illness plague?\\u201dThe reason, he says, is Fox News.\\u201cThe reason Fox News can\\u2019t be honest about what causes mental illness is that Fox News IS what causes mental illness.\\u201cFox News are the propaganda machine of capitalism \\u2013 a system that separates us from one another and tells us the way to solve our individual problems is through purchasing, through buying things, through identifying primarily through our roles as consumers, not as active citizens or participants in society, members in communities that should care about others, but people who shouldn\\u2019t be condemning those who are weaker, vilifying people that act in any way that\\u2019s unusual.\\u201cWe know in the core of our being that that isn\\u2019t right, so it creates a friction and a tension. We know that what [Fox News] is saying isn\\u2019t true.\\u201dBrand then goes on to link the Germanwings crash with Adolf Hitler and the rise of Islamic State:\\u201cThe reality is [Lubitz] lived in a system that causes individuals to malfunction, because we have a lack of cohesion, a lack of connection and a lack of truth.\\u201cIf you want incidents like this, and like the montage at the beginning suggested, less mad individuals whether it\\u2019s Adolf Hitler, Isis, or the fella crashing the plane, if you want less problems of this nature, I believe the solution is not to look at madness, darkness and evil as an outside issue, but as an internal issue.\\u201dHe concludes by saying that Fox News and \\u201cthe big corporations\\u201d want this system to continue:\\u201cWe can never have that conversation properly because FOX News and big corporations benefit from things being the way they are.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 156093}"
