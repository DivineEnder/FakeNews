"{\"title\": \"Twitter De-Verifies Milo Yiannopoulos, Fans Respond With #JeSuisMilo--PC Mag\", \"content\": \"From PC Mag David Murphy writes:\\u00a0Love him or hate him\\u2014and we suspect most likely go for the latter\\u2014but Milo Yiannopoulos certainly spends a lot of time on Twitter. And, until today, he had an official, verified account with the social network. The few extra \\u201cpowers\\u201d that grants one over a normal account aren\\u2019t that big of a deal: filters for notifications, account analytics, and the ability to opt out of group direct messages. The real importance is that it allows a person to confirm that a Twitter handle is officially theirs, as opposed to any other spoof accounts (or hundreds of spoof accounts) that others have made.Twitter has neglected to provide a reason for why it pulled Yiannopoulos\\u2019 verified status, commenting that it doesn\\u2019t share details about specific accounts. In the message the company sent Yiannopoulos, Twitter said that his verification was being pulled as a result of \\u201crecent violations of the Twitter Rules.\\u201d It didn\\u2019t specify which rules, nor did it say how many violations there were (nor how severe they might have been).However, a Twitter executive indicated to Buzzfeed that a tweet Yiannopoulos made in which he told another person that she \\u201cdeserved to be harassed you social justice loser\\u201d might have been the tipping point.You can read the rest of the story here.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 296424}"
