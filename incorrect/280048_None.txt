"{\"title\": \"Does God Exist? Hitchens vs. Craig\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"I had the opportunity to see Christopher Hitchens debate Dr. William Lane Craig on the topic \\u201cDoes God Exist?\\u201d at BIOLA University. The gymnasium was packed with 3,000 people, most of whom were Christians but some non-believers made a showing. Without the home court advantage, you might think Hitchens would be the Lion cast into Daniel\\u2019s Den. Surely the reciprocal of the secular university would happen; he\\u2019d get pies thrown at him, and he would be regularly booed, shouted down and mocked. Hardly.\\n\\nChristopher HitchensChristopher Hitchens is a kind of celebrity, even among Christians because he is an interesting character. If anything, he was warmly embraced by a crowd who generally disagreed with him even as he hurled the worst insults at God, which we consider the holiest, highest being imaginable. This is the demonstration of class and restraint I\\u2019ve noticed from a conservative Christian culture that has a much better record of tolerance than the liberal non-Christian culture.While most of us are familiar with Christopher Hitchens, many people may not know of his opponent Dr. William Lane Craig. I simply call him, \\u201cThe smartest living Christian.\\u201d Like Hitchens, Dr. Craig makes a good living at debate. Dr. Craig is a brilliant logician and eloquent advocate of the faith. He is an \\u201cevidentialist\\u201d in that he argues for the existence of God based on evidence not presupposition (which is another popular form used in debate).I assumed Dr. Craig would win the argument and would show superior technical skills, but I didn\\u2019t know if he could beat Hitchens\\u2019 presence. In modernity, having the right arguments isn\\u2019t enough. More than ever, we are accustomed to disengaging our rational center to embrace an artful presentation. Every Republican should be woefully aware of this by now given the last election. Substance alone doesn\\u2019t cut it, so Dr. Craig\\u2019s greater challenge was to bring a presence to the room that might win over the heart, because I think he\\u2019s got a lock on the mind.The event was moderated by radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, who managed a quick introduction of Hitch\\u2019 and Craig but barely managed to exit the stage. He tripped on his way down, attempted a mid-air correction, contorting like a drunken baby deer having a seizure in a potato-sack. Just as his feet hit the ground he tripped again, never quite giving the audience the satisfaction of completely eating it, but Hugh is famous for having a huge dissatisfied audience. After 15 minutes of flailing on the stage he managed the near impossible task of finding his seat with his life in tact. (I\\u2019m kidding, of course. I consider Hugh a valued friend and someone I deeply respect and admire.)The debate began with Dr. Craig\\u2019s opening arguments. He made a challenge to leave our bias at the door. Impossible, I know, but he claimed that the debate would be fought on philosophical arguments. He would rule out bad arguments, offer the historicity and logic of his good arguments, then challenge Hitchens to make a positive argument for his own atheism. This demonstrates Craig\\u2019s adherence to formal debate tactics. He doesn\\u2019t take his positions based on emotion or preference, he uses argument and reason and follows the evidence.Dr. Craig\\u2019s evidence is presented in 5 different lines of argument:1. The Cosmological Argument; Whatever begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe has a cause. God is the best explanation for that cause.2. The Teleological Argument; The fine-tuning of the universe is so improbable that law or chance aren\\u2019t adequate explanations. God is the best explanation.3. The Moral Argument; If God does not exist, then objective moral values do not exist. Rape isn\\u2019t just culturally unacceptable, it\\u2019s actually wrong.4. The Resurrection of Jesus; The vast majority of historians generally agree that the tomb was empty. Separately, the vast majority of historians generally agree that Jesus appeared to people post-mortem. The hypothesis \\u201cGod raised Jesus from the dead\\u201d is the best explanation of these facts.5. The Immediate Experience of God; Belief that God exists may be rationally accepted as a basic belief not grounded in argument.Christopher Hitchens opened with an argument that Dr. Craig had the obligation to prove God exists with some amount of certainty. The burden isn\\u2019t on the atheist in the debate to show God doesn\\u2019t exist. His position is simply that of a skeptic. Given the idea that God  either does exist or does not exist, Hitch thinks doubt is the better position. He alluded that it is also the more humble position.Hitch doesn\\u2019t claim knowledge that there is no God. He claims ignorance, though he avoids calling himself an agnostic. Because he doesn\\u2019t know and Dr. Craig claims to know that God exists, the disadvantage goes to the one who says, \\u201cI know.\\u201d He says that given the stakes are so extra-ordinary (ie judgment, Heaven and hell, dying for one\\u2019s faith, killing in the name of God) the evidence provided by Dr. Craig wasn\\u2019t extra-ordinary enough to prove a God exists.The most common argument made by Hitchens was that the world contained so much cruelty and brutality for most living creatures across most of existence that a good God didn\\u2019t seem likely, and that if He did exist that He had a lot of bloodshed to answer for. He gave examples of the pre-Christ and even pre-Jewish people who died without ever knowing the one true God. That their lives were lost in ignorance and that only recently does God come on the scene to save some. Hitch returned to this line of reasoning so many times that I\\u2019d say it was his core reason for disbelieving God.Hitch went back to how our belief that God should personally be so concerned with us that we should have the benefit of being born post-Christ to enjoy salvation was a form of solipsism. \\u201cIt\\u2019s all about us.\\u201d he said, \\u201cEverything else was wasted, but at least we\\u2019re here.\\u201dThroughout the rest of the debate, be it the rebuttal, the conclusion, the question/answer, Hitchens returns to this classic problem of suffering, and mocks believers for finding selfish meaning in the midst of evil; \\u201cYou\\u2019re a worm but take heart, it\\u2019s all made for you.\\u201dThe debate was over two hours of complex arguments and rabbit trails, but it was Dr. Craig who refused to go off track from the argument at hand. Hitchens got a lot of laughs, even with his blunt jokes against God and Christians. Dr. Craig managed a good laugh by stating that the 10 steps necessary in the universe to produce evolution consummates a miracle. Hitchens\\u2019 smile of disbelief looking over his glasses at the audience was gold.\\n\\n\\nWilliam Lane CraigHugh Hewitt concluded the event with a final question: \\u201cWhy do people come out over the question of God\\u2019s existence?\\u201d Hitchens believed it was because theocratic threats around the world are getting more coverage and is on our minds. Dr. Craig said that it was because the fruit of Godless modernity is being rejected and people are looking for answers.But in my opinion, though Dr. Craig won the argument (he was the only one who even presented a formal argument), Hitchens won the debate. It\\u2019s not the argument of the debaters, it\\u2019s the condition of the audience that wins the day. While few of Dr. Craig\\u2019s arguments are dispersed through culture, even religious culture, I\\u2019ve been raised on most of Hitchens\\u2019 arguments. Dr. Craig\\u2019s arguments are true and well-reasoned by difficult to comprehend on a first hearing. Hitchens\\u2019 arguments are what we\\u2019ll find spoken against God on prime time television, at the water-cooler, I\\u2019ve even heard some of them on Animal Planet. Culture generally makes Hitchens\\u2019 argument by default. And it\\u2019s easier to claim the skeptic\\u2019s nothing than affirm the something of God\\u2026even when I think the most robust argument is self evident to all of us\\u2026we\\u2019re here.I think if there were atheists in the audience on the brink of salvation that Dr. Craig\\u2019s well-argued positions would find little purchase. Opposite that, the room of Christians would likely have a large segment of doubters, and the cultural arguments against God presented by Hitchens would likely change more minds in my opinion.So are debates judged by the merit of the arguments or the embrace of the audience? In this all important subject, I think the effect on the audience is the preferred measurement. But the evening left little doubt to most of us that Hitchens did not make a case for atheism at all. He barely even acknowledged his own atheism which was oddly refreshing. It reminds me of G. K. Chesterton who said, \\u201cSomehow one can never manage to be an atheist.\\u201dWhat\\u2019s more important is that the debate took place at all. The modern idea that discussions about God (especially for God) should be removed from the public square, education or even casual conversation is the worst position of all. It is good for these atheists and Christians to make a case for what is perhaps the most important question any of us will consider.Does God exist?\", \"article_id\": 280048}"
