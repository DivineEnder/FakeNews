"{\"title\": \"More Excuses From NYT for Lack of 'Fast and Furious' Coverage\", \"content\": \"A few days ago, I reported on an email I received from New York Times senior editor Greg Brock in response to my questions about the paper\\u2019s coverage of the developing \\u201cFast & Furious\\u201d scandal. While the response I was given was nowhere near as rude as the treatment I received from the Washington Post, I was still unsatisfied with the editor\\u2019s explanation for the minimal coverage of this very serious scandal, especially considering the Times\\u2019 obsessive coverage of comparatively insignificant controversies from the Bush Administration. Well, prepare yourselves for a real shocker: after more correspondence, the New York Times is still giving me excuses about their lack of Operation Fast & Furious coverage. Here\\u2019s my first response to Mr. Brock.\\n\\nFirst off thank you so much for your prompt and well explained email. I greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much.But I\\u2019m still not satisfied, especially since writers were so eager to  write about every little development over the AG Gonzalez scandal. If  that scandal, which didn\\u2019t result in the death of a border patrol agent,  deserved so much coverage, how come this one doesn\\u2019t? It doesn\\u2019t even  have to be on page one, but how about in the politics section? Other  publications publish the new developments, but they bury it. At least,  though, they\\u2019re publishing them.Also, how is Congressman Issa\\u2019s plan to issue more subpoenas to Mr.  Holder & others in the DOJ not news worthy? How is an operation that  allows people to sell illegal guns to Mexican drug cartels that  resulted in the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry?\\n\\nJust to let you know I also appreciate your coverage of Mr.  Gonzales\\u2019s scandal. It should be covered! So please give the same  attention to this attorney general\\u2019s scandal.Mary ChastainI never received a response to that email. However, as we all know, thanks to The Daily Caller and Townhall, The House Oversight Committee delivered a subpoena to Attorney General Eric Holder about Operation Fast and Furious. Katie Pavlich posted her article at 10:24AM and C.J. Ciaramella posted his at 12:18PM. I kept combing The New York Times webpage and couldn\\u2019t find anything. I was going to wait until this morning to email Mr. Brock, but I couldn\\u2019t take it anymore. I sent him this email at 6:10PM CDT.\\n\\nDid  you send my email to the editor & reporters responsible for Fast  & Furious? Today Congressman Issa issued the subpoenas to Mr.  Holder. I know The New York Times is the most popular news source in  America, maybe the world, but I don\\u2019t see anything about the subpoenas. I  looked at other news outlets and all of them had it. How come your US  section did not see it important to publish this.I\\u2019m also going to bring up Attorney General Gonzales and went to his  topic page again. So many results about his US attorney scandal! I  couldn\\u2019t help but notice this editorial titled Why This Scandal Matters:  http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/opinion/21mon1.html?ref=albertorgonzales If that scandal mattered Fast & Furious deserves to be covered at  least 10 times more than Mr. Gonzales! I also noticed that an article  about the scandal was published daily, some days even had more than 1  article dedicated to the scandal.You have to talk to the editor & reporters in charge of Fast  & Furious. If The New York Times devoted so much time & energy  to AG Gonzales they need to devote the same plus a lot more to Operation  Fast & Furious.Please respond to me ASAP or at least let me know who I can directly get in touch with about this scandal not being reported.Mary ChastainTake note of the time please. I sent this email at 6:10PM CDT and I searched The New York Times website and could not find anything about the subpoenas. Nothing. I woke up this morning to this email. Something tells me Mr. Brock is not too happy with me.\\n\\nSorry Mr. Brock but this will not do. First off it\\u2019s not an article or even a paragraph. It\\u2019s a blurb. It\\u2019s  a tiny blip on the radar screen. Remember the time stamps? He said I  should have seen it when I sent him my email at 7:10PM EDT. But how is  that possible when at 8:30PM CDT tonight the time stamp on the blurb  said 21 hours ago? That means it was published at 12:30AM EDT.Let\\u2019s  go ahead and give him the benefit of the doubt and maybe they updated  it. However the Times should take a cue from The Daily Caller and other  publications that put a time stamp of the original post and add another  one for updates. But I digress. Mr. Brock stated they published it as  soon as they knew about it. Townhall published theirs at 10:24AM and The Daily Caller published theirs at 12:18PM. Am I the only one finding it hard to believe they knew about the subpoenas before The New York Times?! I let Mr. Brock know how I feel.\\n\\nI  just looked at it again at 8:30 my time and your time stamp said 21  hours ago, which means it would have been published at 12:30AM. Did you  guys update it? It\\u2019s also hard for me to believe you guys published it  when you first heard about it because The Daily Caller published a full  article on it at 12:18PM and Townhall published it at 10:24AM. I\\u2019m sorry  but I find it very hard to believe that The Daily Caller & Townhall  found out about it before The New York Times.Also, how come a subpoena to the attorney general of the United  States deserved basically a blurb on page A22?! I also found a good  article of it on the front page of the politics section at CNN.Please let me know.\\nMary ChastainI wouldn\\u2019t be shocked if Mr. Brock doesn\\u2019t answer me, but I\\u2019m not going to stop until we receive the truth. I\\u2019ll update when I know more here at Big Journalism.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 123706}"
