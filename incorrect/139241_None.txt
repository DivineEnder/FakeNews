"{\"title\": \"Salon's Joan Walsh: Race-Baiting Sirota Was Right\", \"content\": \"One week later, you\\u2019d think Sirota, Salon and those injecting racial politics into the Boston Marathon bombing would have been thoroughly discredited. Enter Salon\\u2019s Joan Walsh. As a guest on MSNBC\\u2019s \\u201cThe Cycle\\u201d she was grilled by panelist SE Cupp about Sirota\\u2019s troubling racial view on the terrorist attack, and Walsh not only defended him, but she proclaimed he was right: \\u00a0SE CUPP: \\u00a0You both seem to suggest that there is a need for conservatives to pin these kinds of moments on non-whites, but surely \\u2013 surely, Joan \\u2013 you have to also admit that there is a need among liberals to pin these kinds of attacks on white right-wingers. Surely, you have to find equal problem with that as well.Walsh: \\u00a0I don\\u2019t know if I find equal problem with it. \\u00a0If it\\u2019s a white America, whites are just not profiled the way, you know, the way other groups are.\\u00a0One of our many privileges is we\\u2019re just individuals. Those are crazy nuts over there, we don\\u2019t have to answer for them.Walsh went on to claim that, when violent attacks are perpetrated by minorities, there is a, \\u201cwave of paranoia, and profiling, and prejudice\\u201d that doesn\\u2019t happen when whites are responsible. However, she offered no real examples of \\u201cwaves of paranoia, profiling and\\u00a0prejudice\\u201d directed at minority groups after violent attacks like the Boston Bombing. It doesn\\u2019t matter, liberal journalists like Walsh and Sirota have just created the myth and it\\u2019s somehow become something that \\u201ceverybody knows.\\u201dCupp challenged Walsh on her colleague\\u2019s irresponsible racial\\u00a0demagoguery, \\u201cBut the wave of paranoia and prejudice is also fomented on the left by folks like David Sirota.\\u201dWatch the entire segment here: \\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 139241}"
