"{\"title\": \"Feminists Need To Know \\u2014 Islam Kills Women\", \"content\": \"The kind of people, in other words, who nobody in their right mind could possibly get along with.While I will always speak out for women to maintain our just civil rights, I do want Sharia Watch to spend significantly more time on freedom of speech (we will run an autumn campaign \\u2018Islam Kills Free Speech\\u2019) and the impact of Islam on children, but before I do, I intend to spend the summer doing something very important \\u2013 informing the ludicrous feminists of today of something they desperately need to know: Islam Kills Women.Islam Kills Women is a joint effort between Sharia Watch UK and Examine-Islam.org\\u00a0 It aims to do one thing and one thing only, show the world just why it is that women are treated so utterly appallingly in every Muslim society on earth.As well as producing articles from various writers and information packs and videos, I will challenge every feminist organisation in Britain to debate me, so that they can attempt to prove me wrong.\\u00a0 When they realise that they cannot do this, I invite them to stand alongside me at the culmination of this campaign \\u2013 a protest rally to be held outside Parliament on August 20th.Islam kills women not only physically \\u2013 although of course it does \\u2013 but it kills the spirit of far greater numbers.\\u00a0 From birth, girls are degraded and humiliated, most often by their own mothers.\\u00a0 These girls accept their status and then pass it on to their own daughters in an endless cycle of what can only be described as evil.Often forced in to marriage, forced to live with domestic violence, and enslaved under a system of \\u2018honour\\u2019, life can be sheer misery for girls unfortunate enough to have been born in to Islam.\\u00a0 To top it off, many will have their clitoris cut off so that sex will be painful and they can suffer the further humiliation of incontinence and other side-effects.All of this, but all of it, is maintained and sustained and justified by Islam.\\u00a0 That is a matter of fact. I will prove it right now.One of the most contentious is FGM so let me start there.\\u00a0 FGM is sanctioned by Islam. Fact. There are several hadiths which justify it.\\u00a0 You can read these here, but I shall recount just one which should be enough to ring a few bells: \\u201cAbu al-Malih ibn `Usama\\u2019s father relates that the Prophet said: \\u201cCircumcision is a law for men and a preservation of honour for women.\\u201d\\u2019 Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5:75; Abu Dawud, Adab 167.While it is true that some Islamic \\u201cscholars\\u201d have condemned FGM, many others promote it and use hadiths to do so. The Muslim Brotherhood for example pushed for FGM when it took over Egypt, and in\\u00a0 \\u201cmoderate\\u201d Indonesia, where somewhere between 80 and 100 per cent of girls suffer this mutilation, 100 per cent of women interviewed believed it to be an Islamic obligation. According to \\u2018Stop FGM Mid East\\u2019 the practice did not exist in Indonesia until the introduction of Islam.Let\\u2019s move on to forced marriage.\\u00a0 Child marriage is rife in the Muslim world, and it is not, as some suggest, simply a consequence of extreme poverty.\\u00a0 The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, for example, has endorsed it on Islamic grounds for the simple reason that Mohammed married a six year old, therefore it must be permissible.The relevant hadith is this: \\u201cThe Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death)\\u201d (Bukhari 7.62.88)Iran allows the marriage of nine-year-old girls based on these same hadiths, and recent attempts in Pakistan to prevent child marriage were stopped by the Council of Islamic Ideology who deemed it \\u201cblasphemous\\u201d and \\u201cun-Islamic\\u201d.\\u00a0 The chairman of the council helpfully explained: \\u201cParliament cannot create legislation that is against the teachings of the Holy Quran or Sunnah.\\u201dStoning to death sounds just too terrible to be true.\\u00a0 It sounds like something from pre-history that couldn\\u2019t possibly be happening today, but it is \\u2013 in one kind of society only, Islamic society.\\u00a0 It is a punishment used almost exclusively on women accused of committing adultery.\\u00a0 I say \\u2018accused\\u2019 because that is all it takes, she has no defence.Remember that under Islamic law, a woman\\u2019s word is worth half of a man\\u2019s, so if her husband accuses her, her denial is worthless and she will be found guilty on his word alone. This is brilliantly illustrated in the hard-to-watch movie \\u2018The Stoning of Soraya M\\u2019, a true story about the stoning of a young mother in Iran on the word of her husband only; he simply wanted rid of her. Her father and sons joined in with the stoning.Stoning for adultery occurs under Islamic law for a reason that you may by now be able to guess: it was endorsed by Mohammed. There are several Islamic sources to back this up. I will recount just one part of Sahih Bukhari 3:50:885 which reads: Allah\\u2019s Apostle said, \\u201cBy Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah\\u2019s Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt, stone her to death.\\u201d Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah\\u2019s Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death.Domestic and honour violence can be banded together as I believe they emanate from one verse of the Koran \\u2013 Sura 4, verse 34, which reads: \\u201cMen have authority over women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband\\u2019s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance \\u2013 [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them.\\u201dCould this verse be any clearer?\\u00a0 Women must obey and if they don\\u2019t, you may use violence against them. This can, and in practice does, justify all kinds of horrors against women. It is very clear that if the men in her family don\\u2019t approve of her conduct, they can beat her for it.I have not even scratched the surface. The oppression of women in Islamic countries is by far the cruellest in the world. No other major societies treat their women in this way and that is not an unfortunate coincidence, it is the direct result of these and many other teachings in Islamic scripture.With all of this evidence in front of them, my challenge to British feminists is this: will you admit the truth in what I have written, and do you want this religion to have more or less influence in countries where women have fought and died for their freedom?If, like me, you want to see a religion like this have zero influence, will you stand with me and oppose its import via mass immigration as Sharia Watch and Examine Islam intend to do on August 20th?My guess is that you will not. You will not even respond to my requests, and you certainly won\\u2019t have the courage to debate me. You will continue to pretend that the truth is bigotry and that the lie is moral, and you will continue to deny the most pertinent truth about the treatment of women in the Middle East, Africa, and increasingly in Europe \\u2013 this abhorrent treatment of women has everything to do with Islam.\\u00a0To donate to the Islam Kills Women campaign, please visit www.shariawatch.org.uk and click the \\u2018Donate\\u2019 button.\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 164963}"
