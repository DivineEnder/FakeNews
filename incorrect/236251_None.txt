"{\"title\": \"Same Church Lady, Different Religion\", \"content\": \"If you thought Dana Carvey\\u2019s  Church Lady died with the 90s she\\u2019s back \\u2013 complete with a shrill intolerance past the  point of being funny. Sean Penn contorts his muzzle to the side of his face and asks, \\u201cWhat made you support the definition of marriage being between a man and a woman? Was it\\u2026mmm, HATRED?!\\u201d\\n\\nGreat, now the blue-haired old lady  has been replaced by a finger-wagging liberal industry star using the spotlight to  shove religion down the next generation\\u2019s throat. There\\u2019s no self reflection,  only the kind of self-righteous condemnation that comes from a rock solid adherence to a dogma.It\\u2019s the same secular humanist dogma the Church Lady swallowed in her youth. She even remembers the sacred text from her book of John Dewey 22:6: \\u201cTrain up a lefty in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\\u201dKeep looking down your nose at  my pro-life stand, hold your crazy \\u201cEnd Is Near\\u201d picket signs warning  of   apocalyptic environmental disaster, and always-always-always read my mind and know my motives boil down to  hateful, bigoted, superstitious, incurious, uncreative, unenlightened or any other bigoted stereotype you shove down my throat from your Sunday School throne.Same Church Lady, different religion. Only this time I don\\u2019t believe in your hell, your Jesus or your doomsday scenarios designed to manipulate a fuller offering plate from your sucker congregation.Please reserve the schtick for the choir because all you\\u2019re getting from me is laughter.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 236251}"
