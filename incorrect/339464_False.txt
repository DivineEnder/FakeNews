"{\"article_id\": 339464, \"title\": \"Cuomo Finds Prison Emergency Is Also an Opportunity\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Less than 48 hours after a whirlwind visit to the Clinton Correctional Facility, Gov.Andrew M. Cuomowas ready for a full-fledged media blitz.\\\",\\\"In a succession of rapid-fire television interviews on Monday, the governor spoke of the daring prison break in far northern New York State, warning that a pair of \\u201cdesperate, dangerous men\\u201d were on the loose. \\u201cThey are literally killers,\\u201d he said, vowing to put the escapees behind bars.\\\",\\\"And when asked on the \\u201cToday\\u201d show on NBC about a taunting note the fugitives left behind, Mr. Cuomo displayed a touch of swagger. \\u201cThey had a little bit of the comedian in them,\\u201d he told an anchor, Savannah Guthrie. \\u201cBut I plan on giving them back that note, Savannah.\\u201d\\\",\\\"For Mr. Cuomo, the escaped men represent both a genuine law-enforcement challenge \\u2014 how to chase down a pair of killers in a remote corner of the state \\u2014 and an unexpected break from the deepest political doldrums of his time in office.\\\",\\\"The two convicted murderers, Richard W. Matt and David Sweat, broke out of the prison in Dannemora, N.Y., with just under two weeks left in a legislative session that has been deeply frustrating for Mr. Cuomo. Many of his initiatives have stalled in the Legislature, and his poll numbers have fallen sharply amid corruption indictments against Albany\\u2019s two top legislators.\\\",\\\"Fellow Democrats have lamented the failure to pass key liberal priorities, such as an increase in the minimum wage and a version of the Dream Act that would grant tuition benefits to certain undocumented immigrants.\\\",\\\"But all these matters were far from the political foreground as Mr. Cuomo toured the airwaves, hurling himself into a crisis generated neither by Albany nor by a federal prosecutor\\u2019s office.\\\",\\\"Mr. Cuomo canceled a trip to the Belmont Stakes on Saturday so he could rush to the prison. In photos shared over social media, he peered into jail cells and climbed metal ladders in the belly of the 19th-century penitentiary.\\\",\\\"Television anchors invited Mr. Cuomo to narrate photographs and video of his visit to the prison and pressed him to sketch out the latest theories as to how the escape unfolded.\\\",\\\"Mr. Cuomo has energetically obliged. He suggested that the prisoners surely had help in their escape and must have been overheard by other inmates. He has shared his suspicion that any accomplices were unlikely to be prison guards, but perhaps civilians or private contractors working at the prison.\\\",\\\"\\u201cMaybe a civilian employee developed a relationship with one of them,\\u201dMr. Cuomo speculatedon Fox Business Network \\u2014 a late addition on Monday to his four previously scheduled television appearances. \\u201cThat happens from time to time.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Cuomo, who has not held a scheduled news conference in Albany since February, did not face a single question on any other issue facing the state.\\\",\\\"Beyond avoiding the Albany press corps, Mr. Cuomo, with the prison emergency, has had a respite from a dismal season in the state capital, pollsters said. Three polls from the past few weeks have shown his approval rating in a slump, with barely two in five New Yorkers giving him positive marks.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe\\u2019s doing what a governor ought to do, and in the process getting a little bit of sexy attention: \\u2018Governor looks at manhole\\u2019; \\u2018Governor says lock your doors,\\u2019 \\u201d said Maurice Carroll, an assistant director of theQuinnipiac University poll. \\u201cIt gives him a chance to act like a governor and get away from, \\u2018What are we going to do about the rent-control laws?\\u2019 \\u201d\\\",\\\"Seeking visibility in a crisis has long been central to Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s method of governing. In May, he raced to theIndian Pointnuclear plant in Westchester County after atransformer firethere. In February, he appeared at the scene of aMetro-North Railroad crash, also in Westchester, and gave multiple television and radio interviews the following morning.\\\",\\\"Last fall, in the midst of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Mr. Cuomo held a joint news conference with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to announce amandatory quarantinefor travelers into the New York area, bucking federal authorities\\u2019 more cautious recommendations.\\\",\\\"State Senator Betty Little, a Republican who represents Dannemora, said Mr. Cuomo had regularly visited her district in trying moments. \\u201cHe goes to the North County in floods and disasters that we\\u2019ve had,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s been there often, and I think it was appropriate.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The prison break may be an especially resonant crisis for Mr. Cuomo: In 1983, Mr. Cuomo was an aide to his father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, whenan uprising at the Ossining Correctional Facilityoccurred just days after his inauguration. Tim Russert, then a senior adviser to the elder Mr. Cuomo, noted that the governor \\u201cwas informed within minutes,\\u201d adding, \\u201cAndrew fortunately was with him and went to spend the night.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Faced with his own prison emergency, Mr. Cuomo has used newer tools to project an image of hands-on involvement. His office has used the website Flickr to postmore than two dozen pictures of his visit to Dannemora, and his official Twitter account has updated nearly as often, posting updates on the manhunt and on the governor\\u2019s news media appearances.\\\",\\\"If there is a strong element of theater to the experience, Mr. Cuomo has seemed to embrace it \\u2014 he repeatedly likened the prison break to the film \\u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\\u201d and called the convicts\\u2019 scheme something beyond Hollywood\\u2019s imagining. (For his own part, Mr. Cuomo has seized his role in an on-camera manhunt with all the vigor of Tommy Lee Jones in \\u201cThe Fugitive.\\u201d)\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf it was a movie plot,\\u201d Mr. Cuomo said on CNN, \\u201cyou would say that it was overdone.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
