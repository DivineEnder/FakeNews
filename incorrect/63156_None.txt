"{\"title\": \"Thoreau born in Mass., July 12, 1817\", \"content\": \"Panic has taken hold all over the White House after Donald Trump\\u2019s upset victory.On this day in 1817, Henry David Thoreau, a guiding spirit of the conservation movement, was born in Concord, Mass. For some, Thoreau\\u2019s advocacy of simple, principled living remains a compelling idea. His writings on the relationship between people and the environment, which ultimately came to involve the government as well, have underpinned the continuing efforts to preserve our natural resources.After graduating from Harvard in 1837, Thoreau held a series of odd jobs. Encouraged by Concord neighbor and friend Ralph Waldo Emerson, he started publishing essays, poems and reviews in the transcendentalist magazine The Dial. His 1842 essay \\u201cNatural History of Massachusetts\\u201d reflected his talent for writing about nature.From 1845 to 1847, Thoreau lived in a cabin on the edge of Walden Pond, a glacial lake near Concord. Guided by the maxim \\u201cSimplify, simplify,\\u201d he limited his outlays, his possessions and his contacts. His goal was \\u201cto live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach.\\u201dWhen his writing failed to win money or acclaim, he became a surveyor to support himself. As a result, Thoreau\\u2019s later years increasingly were spent outdoors, observing and writing about nature. His seminal essay, \\u201cSuccession of Forest Trees,\\u201d describes the ecology of the woodlands, highlighting the role of birds and animals in dispersing seeds. Thoreau\\u2019s essay, republished posthumously in \\u201cExcursions,\\u201d makes the forward-looking case that federal forest management systems should mirror existing woodland ecology.\\u201cIf a man does not keep pace with his companions,\\u201d Thoreau wrote, \\u201cperhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\\u201d Thoreau died at home on May 6, 1862, still considered something of a failure by Concord\\u2019s merchants and farmers.SOURCE: U.S. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 63156}"
