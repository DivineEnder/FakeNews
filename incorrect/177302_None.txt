"{\"title\": \"Putting al-Qaeda Ahead of the CIA?\", \"content\": \"Remember when you couldn\\u2019t turn on nightly newscasts without hearing something about CIA employee Valerie Plame being \\u201couted\\u201d by the Bush Administration?  Democrat House Chairman held hearings.  Grand juries were impaneled. A special prosecutor was appointed and the media pursued every possible angle.Now consider a similar case, but with different actors.  Have you heard of the group of lawyers associated with the American Civil Liberties Union self titled the \\u201cJohn Adams Project\\u201d?  These folks apparently hired private investigators to take pictures of CIA agents they believe may have interrogated terrorists after September 11th.  They then passed these pictures on to the lawyers defending said terrorists in hopes that one of them will accuse the agents of torture.  These photos of covert CIA agents were later found in the cells of al-Qaeda members being held at Guantanamo Bay.The Obama Justice Department is quietly investigating the lawyers associated with the John Adams Project who may have violated a number of laws in place to protect our covert operatives and their families.  But so far, with few exceptions, the media and their friends on Capitol Hill haven\\u2019t found this case nearly as interesting as Valerie Plame.  Could it have anything to do with the ideological bent of the perpetrators?Reflecting on his life, John Adams called his defense of British soldiers after the Boston massacre \\u201cone of the most gallant, generous, manly, and disinterested actions of my whole life, and one of the best pieces of service I ever rendered my country.\\u201d  I couldn\\u2019t agree more. Sadly, an insidious group of lawyers associated with the ACLU only tarnish Adam\\u2019s reputation by seeking to hide their subversive acts behind the reputation of our second President.This week, I will be sending a letter to President Obama calling for a full and immediate accounting of any individuals currently or formerly employed by the Federal government who may have assisted this project in anyway.  I already have a dozen Congressmen on this letter and hope to have many more by the time I send it, to make it clear to the President that we are very concerned about what happened.  Our country deserves to know the truth about the John Adams Project.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 177302}"
