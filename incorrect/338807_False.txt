"{\"title\": \"Eric Garner Case Goes Largely Unmentioned as Prosecutor Runs for Congress\", \"content\": \"{\\\"The death of Eric Garner at the hands of the police on Staten Island has given rise toprotests, marches and afederal civil rights inquiry, and brought national attention to the borough\\u2019s district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., when a grand jurydeclined to bring charges.\\\",\\\"But in the special election in the 11th Congressional District in New York, where Mr. Donovan is the favorite to win on Tuesday, the Garner case has been reduced to a faint echo.\\\",\\\"The election, to fill a vacant House seat representing Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, might have been expected to become part of the heightened debate over race and policing: a clash, at the ballot box, over the issues that have fueled civil unrest in parts of the country, most recently in Baltimore, where riots erupted after another black man died in police custody.\\\",\\\"Instead, the New York campaign has unfolded as a subdued affair. National Democrats, many of whom expressed dismay at the Staten Island grand jury\\u2019s decision late last year, have not rallied against Mr. Donovan, a Republican. Their national political committees are not expected to spend substantial resources in the race.\\\",\\\"Mr. Donovan has stuck to a practiced script on occasions when the Garner investigation has come up, urging voters to respect the grand jury\\u2019s decision. He has answered few specific questions about the grand jury, often citing secrecy requirements.\\\",\\\"Even the Democratic nominee, City Councilman Vincent J. Gentile, has shied away from discussing Mr. Garner\\u2019s death and his treatment by the police. During a recent debate, Mr. Gentile used his lone opportunity to question Mr. Donovan to press him not on the Garner case, but on the minimum wage. (Mr. Donovan seemed unable to identify the federal wage as $7.25 per hour.)\\\",\\\"Mr. Gentile said in an interview that the Garner investigation had not been a central concern in the election. Voters are primarily interested in economic issues, he said; in the part of the district based in Brooklyn, the Garner case hardly comes up at all.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou know, occasionally you get it as a question in Staten Island,\\u201d Mr. Gentile said, arguing that the secrecy of the grand jury process had left voters without adequate information. \\u201cWe\\u2019re frustrated, because we can\\u2019t comment on it in any intelligible way, because we don\\u2019t know what went on.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Gentile, a former prosecutor who described himself as a \\u201claw-and-order guy,\\u201d has been especially cautious in speaking about the Garner case. Asked whether he believed he could have delivered an indictment, had he been presenting evidence to jurors, Mr. Gentile gave a careful answer.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to say, because I don\\u2019t know what the police officer said,\\u201d Mr. Gentile said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what questions he was asked by the jury or the prosecutor. But it\\u2019s hard to get around that video.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cThat video is pretty powerful,\\u201d he added, \\u201cto suggest there is enough evidence to move forward.\\u201d\\\",\\\"There is a political logic to Mr. Gentile\\u2019s restraint: Though he lives in Brooklyn, the bulk of the district is based in conservative-leaning Staten Island, with its large population of civil servants and law enforcement veterans.\\\",\\\"Little public polling has been done on the issue, but in January, a survey taken by Quinnipiac University found that 66 percent of New Yorkers believedthere was \\u201cabsolutely no excuse\\u201d for how the police handled Mr. Garner. Within the smaller sample of Staten Island voters, a majority said the conduct of the police was \\u201cunderstandable.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Donovan has collected support from police and firefighter unions, and it is unclear whether the Garner case has meaningfully dentedhis political standing. Robert Blizzard, a pollster for his campaign, said that it had not, and that voters \\u201cstrongly approve of how he handled the case as district attorney.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Republicans, mindful of Staten Island\\u2019s ideological tilt and insular political culture, have been eager to draw in Democratic leaders from outside the district, particularly ones unpopular with law enforcement. They have linked Mr. Gentile to Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Mr. Donovan\\u2019s campaign has solicited money by raising the prospect that the Rev. Al Sharpton, who helped lead citywide protests around the Garner case, might get involved in the election. (He has not.)\\\",\\\"The Brooklyn borough president, Eric L. Adams, a leading critic of police methods in the wake of the Garner case, said Mr. Gentile was wise to avoid any appearance of exploiting the issue. Mr. Adams, a Democrat who plans to campaign for Mr. Gentile, said he had advised the councilman to focus on grand jury secrecy.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe case has probably helped Donovan more than hurt him,\\u201d said Mr. Adams, noting that the issue tended to be particularly divisive. \\u201cThose who dislike the decision not to indict are passionate about it, but on the other side of the coin, people are passionate that the officer should not have been indicted.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Still, some Democrats consider it a mistake to tread so lightly around the grand jury matter: Mr. Sharpton, who emphasized that he has not been engaged in the race, said Democrats risked depressing turnout by ducking an issue of deep concern to many in the party\\u2019s base.\\\",\\\"Mr. Sharpton compared Mr. Donovan unfavorably to the authorities in North Charleston, S.C., where apolice officer was swiftly indictedand dismissed from his job this month after shooting a fleeing, unarmed man in the course of a routine traffic stop.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe contrast between him and a police chief in a state that still flies a Confederate flag on the Capitol is something that independent voters may be concerned about,\\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \\u201cIn a special election, you can\\u2019t go by the normal political demographics. You have to go by turnout \\u2014 who energizes their base to come out.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Gentile\\u2019s hope is that, even with the Garner issue having faded, Democrats will show up to vote based on his feisty economic message. He has defended the Affordable Care Act (Republicans, Mr. Gentile said, aim to \\u201ctake 16.4 million people off Obamacare, and they offer no alternative\\u201d) and announced his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreementthe White House backsand many unions oppose.\\\",\\\"But Mr. Gentile acknowledged that turning out voters would be a challenge, and said it would be easier to win the seat in a presidential election year, with a national candidate like Hillary Rodham Clinton driving participation. He faces another disadvantage: Mr. Donovan has raised more money, outpacing Mr. Gentile three to one, Federal Election Commission records show.\\\",\\\"Though he did not complain about the lack of national Democratic support for his bid, Mr. Gentile lamented the vote\\u2019s timing. After theresignation of Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican who pleaded guilty to tax fraud, a judge ordered Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat,to schedule the election without delay, and it landed on May 5.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThank you, Mr. Governor, for making it Cinco de Mayo, right?\\u201d Mr. Gentile said, with a laugh.\\\",\\\"In a crowd of Staten Island commuters, less than two weeks before the election, awareness of the coming election was mixed at best. A number of voters were reluctant to express their views of the Garner case; one young black woman, asked about the grand jury\\u2019s decision, made a zip-it-up gesture in front of her mouth and walked away.\\\",\\\"Allister McLeod, an auditor who says he is a Democrat, said the most important issues to him were income inequality and education, though he disapproved of the outcome in the Garner investigation.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it was handled as well as it should have been,\\u201d said Mr. McLeod, who is black. \\u201cBased on the video that was taken, it was clear that the officer should have been indicted.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Richard Vasconi, a retired police officer who is white, said he recognized that there was a level of frustration with the grand jury process. But Mr. Vasconi, a Republican who supports Mr. Donovan, said it was unfortunate that Mr. Garner struggled with the police: \\u201cIf the man hadn\\u2019t fought the way he did, he wouldn\\u2019t have had a heart attack.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Lisa Kogen, who is white and a self-described liberal Democrat, said she believed the Garner case was \\u201cappalling,\\u201d but understood why Mr. Gentile had tiptoed around the issue.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s happening with the police in the United States,\\u201d said Ms. Kogen, who works at the Women\\u2019s League for Conservative Judaism, adding, of Mr. Gentile: \\u201cHe knows his constituency.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 338807}"
