"{\"title\": \"World View: In Major Reversal, U.S. Will Provide Military Aid to Syria Opposition\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"This morning\\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\\nNetwork Solutions has crashed GenerationalDynamics.com again,apparently because they\\u2019re unable to handle the increased numberof visitors in the past couple of months.\\nSo I\\u2019m currently in panic mode, moving the web site to anotherweb hosting service.  I\\u2019ve already signed up with another service,but it takes a couple of days for the domain name pointers topropagate through the internet.Unless you see World View on another web site, or receive it ine-mail, then by the time you read this the web site will have beenmoved.I apologize for the inconvenience.We reported two weeks ago that the opposition Syrian NationalCoalition (SNC) canceled plans to attend meetings in Rome, Moscow andWashington to discuss the Syria issue, on the grounds that thesemeetings did not thing but provide a cover for the regime of Syria\\u2019spresident Bashar al-Assad to massacre innocent mothers and daughtersin their homes, and innocent students in their college dormitories.Well, this apparently shocked the Obama administration into action,and now the administration says that they\\u2019ve reversed policy, andthey\\u2019re going to send aid to the Syrian rebels.  The aid will includebody armor, armored vehicles, and humanitarian aid.  So the SNC haschanged its mind, and will attend the meetings after all.  However,this may well be an empty promise, since it has to be coordinated withthe Russians, who have vetoed any aid attempt in the past.
