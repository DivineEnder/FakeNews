"{\"title\": \"EXCLUSIVE \\u2013 Jackie Mason: Hillary Has More FBI Agents Following Her than Delegates\", \"content\": \"Mason was responding to a recently corrected Washington Post news article that first cited\\u00a0a lawmaker briefed by FBI Director James B. Comey as saying\\u00a0the FBI assigned 147 agents to investigate Clinton\\u2019s private emails.\\u201cTwo U.S. law enforcement officials have since told The Washington Post that figure is too high,\\u201d reads the correction. \\u201cThe FBI will not provide an exact figure, but the officials say the number of FBI personnel involved is fewer than 50.\\u201dBut that didn\\u2019t stop Mason from jesting about the subject during his regular segment on \\u201cAaron Klein\\u00a0Investigative Radio,\\u201d the popular weekend talk radio program broadcast on New York\\u2019s\\u00a0AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. Klein doubles\\u00a0as\\u00a0Breitbart\\u2019s senior investigative reporter and Jerusalem bureau chief.Mason stated, \\u201cShe has more FBI agents following her than she does have delegates. If all the FBI agents were delegates, she would have been elected twenty minutes ago.\\u201dListen to Klein\\u2019s interview with Mason below:The stand-up comic said he was shocked that any voter could trust Clinton:How anybody would even think of voting for her is inconceivable to me\\u2026 She has a history of lying even when there\\u2019s no reason to lie. \\u00a0Every time somebody says \\u2018Hello,\\u2019 she already answers it with a lie. If she says, \\u2018Good morning,\\u2019 it\\u2019s probably \\u2018Good night.\\u2019 This woman can\\u2019t tell the truth because if she told the truth she would probably die from the shock.If this woman was a friend of yours would you even talk to her? If you had a friend that every time they said something it was a lie, how long would you want to be a friend of hers? You wouldn\\u2019t want to talk to her but you\\u2019d want her to be president?\\u00a0 Let\\u2019s be honest about it. I would be afraid to ask her what time it is. I\\u2019m sure I\\u2019d get the wrong answer.Note: Jackie Mason will be performing\\u00a0at the Keswick Theatre in Glendside, PA on Thursday May 19, 2016. Tickets are available here.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 166723}"
