"{\"title\": \"Free Syrian Army Disputes Claims It Has Discussed Military Cooperation with Moscow\", \"content\": \"According to reports from both Russian media and Reuters, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bodganov claims that delegations from the Free Syrian Army have visited Moscow several times, as recently as last week. Representatives from several factions within the FSA have denied these reports.\\u201cOn Sunday, members of\\u00a0the Free Syrian Army sent a proposal to\\u00a0Russia on\\u00a0holding talks in\\u00a0Cairo on\\u00a0cooperation in\\u00a0the Syrian conflict settlement,\\u201d claims a report at\\u00a0Sputnik News.\\u201cThe Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly stated that it was ready to\\u00a0cooperate with\\u00a0the FSA and asked the United States and the United Kingdom for\\u00a0assistance in\\u00a0establishing contacts with\\u00a0the group to\\u00a0better coordinate efforts in\\u00a0the fight against\\u00a0Islamic State in\\u00a0Syria,\\u201d\\u00a0Sputnik\\u00a0adds.The tenor of Russian relations with the FSA is slightly different at Reuters, which relates the same claim from Bodganov that Syrian rebels have visited Moscow, plus Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\\u2019s assurance that the Russians are ready to assist the FSA \\u201cif they knew where they were.\\u201dGiven the number of Russian bombs that have fallen on their positions, the FSA may not be terribly eager to let the Russian military know where they are, but they did express willingness to negotiate with Moscow and possibly pursue future cooperation after the airstrikes stop.\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t turn down the offer. We just said if the Russians are serious in their offer they should stop immediately targeting our bases and targeting the civil areas,\\u201d Reuters quotes Major Issam al-Reis telling the BBC about Russia\\u2019s offer of assistance. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t need the help now, they should stop attacking our bases and then we can talk about future co-operation.\\u201dAs Reuters observes, the FSA\\u2019s fortunes have waned during its time as the Western world\\u2019s nominal ally on the ground in Syria, with the moderate rebels \\u201ceclipsed\\u201d by ISIS and al-Qaeda\\u2019s Nusra Front. As Major Reis complained to the BBC, the FSA finds itself battling multiple enemies without enough weapons and with little confidence in the West\\u2019s willingness to arm them more heavily.That reluctance stems, in part, from fears that advanced Western munitions would end up in the hands of terrorists. It is also difficult to see how the outnumbered, outgunned FSA can prevail against the ISIS terror state, other sinister elements of the Syrian rebellion,\\u00a0and\\u00a0the Assad regime, now reinforced with Russian air power and Iranian ground forces. Obviously the Russian offer of \\u201cassistance\\u201d to the FSA would not involve assisting them with overthrowing Assad, but they might find a place in the Russo-Iranian-Syrian battle against al-Qaeda and ISIS.If the FSA is sending emissaries to Moscow for serious negotiations, they might be looking for one of those \\u201cexit strategies\\u201d Western media are always talking about and counting on Moscow to do what the Obama administration has not been able to do\\u2014work with the Assad regime to find a place for Free Syrian Army supporters in post-war Syria.The Free Syrian Army is an umbrella organization consisting of several different factions. On Tuesday evening, representatives from four of those factions told Reuters that Russian media reports about FSA emissaries visiting Moscow were false.\\u201cNothing of this sort happened on our part as FSA,\\u201d insisted a spokesman for Alwiyat Seif al-Sham, which operates in southern Syria. \\u201cIt is impossible for us to accept going to Moscow, and to have dialogue with it. We don\\u2019t want their help.\\u201d He said his group checked with its allies, and they all denied sending people to Moscow.\\u201cThe Syrian Coalition considers these claims a part of the Russian misleading propaganda that aims at diverting attention from failures of the Russian aggression on the Syrian people,\\u201d said the main FSA group backed by the West, the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces, in a statement posted on its website.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 242419}"
