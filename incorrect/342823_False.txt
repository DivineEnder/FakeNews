"{\"article_id\": 342823, \"title\": \"End of Crude Oil Export Ban Is Possible\", \"content\": \"{\\\"WASHINGTON \\u2014  For months, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, and Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, formed a quiet, persistent alliance as they sought to convince their colleagues that it was time to end a more than 40-year ban on crude oil exports.\\\",\\\"They turned the Senate floor into a symposium on the history of Nixon-era oil price controls. They offered up lectures on modern-day energy economics. They stressed the potential for using crude oil exports to increase American soft power \\u2014 by limiting the reliance of American allies on oil-producing rivals like Iran and Russia.\\\",\\\"And they also regularly drew the anger of liberal senators who warned that lifting the ban would harm the environment and potentially raise energy costs in the United States.\\\",\\\"In the end, it seems, their efforts were an exemplar in soft-power legislating. After months of cajoling, Congress seems to be on the verge of lifting the crude oil export ban as part of a giant year-end spending and tax deal.\\\",\\\"As high-stakes negotiations on the spending and tax packages continued Thursday between congressional leaders and the Obama administration, the Senate approved an emergency stopgap measure to prevent a government shutdown and give negotiators five more days to reach a deal.\\\",\\\"Meanwhile, an admonition by the White House press secretary suggested that Democrats and Republicans were still deadlocked over some politically charged policy prescriptions.\\\",\\\"Officials in both parties, however, said that a provision to end the oil export ban remained at the center of the talks, possibly tied to an extension of tax credits for wind andsolar power. Lifting the ban would represent a historic shift in American energy policy. It would also be a towering victory for the senators\\u2019 home states, where oil producers and related businesses have been hammered by a global downturn in prices.\\\",\\\"Liberal supporters of the export ban have complained that ending it would harm the environment and hurt American consumers \\u2014 an argument that has become more difficult to make at a time of relatively low gasoline prices. Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, criticized the push to lift the ban, but his remarks also focused on the need for extending tax credits for renewable energy \\u2014 a signal that some sort of deal may be inevitable.\\\",\\\"Analysts often note that the debate around the crude oil export ban is extremely complicated \\u2014 a point emphasized by the fact that while domestic oil production in the United States has risen sharply since 2009, by more than two million barrels per day, projections show that American imports of foreign oil will continue at a rate of six million to eight million barrels per day through 2040. This is largely because of differences in the types of crude oil, with excess amounts of light, sweet crude being produced in the United States while domestic refineries are designed to handle heavier, sour crude from abroad.\\\",\\\"At the energy committee hearing on Wednesday, several experts on global oil issues testified that lifting the crude oil export ban would be a positive step \\u2014 even if the impact was relatively imperceptible at first because of current low prices.\\\",\\\"The limited immediate impact \\u2014 and particularly the reduced chance that lifting the export ban would increase gasoline prices for American motorists \\u2014 has made the prospect of ending the ban more politically palatable to the Obama administration and many Democrats and even some Republicans who feared a backlash should constituents see a rise in prices at the pump.\\\",\\\"In that sense, lifting the ban would deliver a long-sought policy victory for congressional Republicans at a time when many rank-and-file lawmakers are angry that Senate Democrats and the White House often block much of their legislative agenda.\\\",\\\"The Republican-controlled House has twice voted this fall to approve legislation that would end the crude oil export ban. Legislation proposed by Senators Murkowski and Heitkamp has yet to reach the Senate floor, but would not need to if their proposals are included in the year-end spending and tax deal.\\\",\\\"In her version of the legislation, Ms. Heitkamp had included provisions that might make a compromise with the White House easier, including a proposal that would give the president the authority to restrict exports for up to one year under certain circumstances and to extend those restrictions on an annual basis. Among the acceptable reasons for doing so would be national security threats, or a national emergency including an oil shortage or a spike in prices.\\\",\\\"Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, noted recent testimony by the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, who said a decrease in oil production was a drag on the economy. \\u201cBoth on an economic and national security, and I might add, environmental basis,\\u201d Mr. Cassidy said, \\u201cthere\\u2019s such a strong case for allowing U.S. export of oil.\\u201d\\\",\\\"At a policy forum in September, Ms. Heitkamp expressed optimism in the face of long odds. \\u201cWhen we started over a year ago, everybody thought we were crazy,\\u201d she said. \\u201cEverybody told me, \\u2018You are crazy to think this is going to happen in the short term.\\u2019 I kept saying, \\u2018I think we can get this done this year if we are willing to respond to some of the concerns, if we are willing to come to the table and actually negotiate.\\u2019\\u00a0\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
