"{\"title\": \"Teacher to Parents: About THAT Kid (The One Who Hits, Disrupts and Influences YOUR Kid)\", \"content\": \"Dear Parent:I know. You\\u2019re worried. Every day, your child comes home with a story about THAT kid. The one who is always hitting, shoving, pinching, scratching, maybe even biting other children. The one who always has to hold my hand in the hallway. The one who has a special spot at the carpet, and sometimes sits on a chair rather than the floor. The one who had to leave the block center because blocks are not for throwing. The one who climbed over the playground fence right exactly as I was telling her to stop. The one who poured his neighbor\\u2019s milk\\u00a0onto the floor in a fit of anger. On purpose. While I was watching. And then, when I asked him to clean it up,\\u00a0emptied the ENTIRE paper towel dispenser. On purpose. While I was watching.\\u00a0The one who dropped the REAL ACTUAL F-word in gym class.You\\u2019re worried that THAT child is detracting from your child\\u2019s learning experience. You\\u2019re worried that he takes up too much of my time and energy, and that your child won\\u2019t get his fair share. You\\u2019re worried that she is really going to hurt someone some day. You\\u2019re worried that \\u201csomeone\\u201d might be your child. You\\u2019re worried that your child is going to start using aggression to get what she wants. You\\u2019re worried your child is going to fall behind academically because I might not notice that he is struggling to hold a pencil. I know.Your child, this year, in this classroom, at this age, is not THAT child. Your child is not perfect, but she generally follows rules. He is able to share toys peaceably. She does not throw furniture. He raises his hand to speak. She works when it is time to work, and plays when it is time to play. He can be trusted to go straight to the bathroom and straight back again with no shenanigans. She thinks that the S-word is \\u201cstupid\\u201d and the C-word is \\u201ccrap.\\u201d I know.Read the rest of the story at the Washington Post.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 214972}"
