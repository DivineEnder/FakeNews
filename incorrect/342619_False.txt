Ryan, urged lawmakers to \\u201cdo more\\u201d to protect people after the deadly shooting last week at aPlanned Parenthoodclinic in Colorado.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOne common denominator in these tragedies is mental illness,\\u201d Mr. Ryan said, calling the clinic shooting on Friday, which left three people dead, \\u201cappalling.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cThat\\u2019s why we need to look at fixing our nation\\u2019s mental illness health system,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"While Democrats made it clear they believed that Republicans were avoiding the real problem \\u2014 lax restrictions on access to guns \\u2014 Mr. Ryan encouraged lawmakers from both parties to present their ideas to address the problems with mental health care.\\\",\\\"He expressed support for an ambitious proposal that would make major changes to the mental health care system. The bill would, among other steps, create an assistant secretary post in the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate the government\\u2019s approach and remedy a shortage of beds in psychiatric hospitals.\\\",\\\"Representative Tim Murphy, the Pennsylvania Republican who is a clinical psychologist and who introduced the bill,spent a year conducting research on the systemafter the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. He carried out that study at the request of House Republican leaders; his bill is under consideration by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\\\",\\\"Other proposals include a bill from Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, that would help law enforcement agencies identify and seek treatment for those with mental health problems. An aide to Mr. Cornyn said Tuesday that discussions were underway to potentially combine his proposals with similar legislation.\\\",\\\"The clinic shooting, in which a 57-year-old loner, Robert L. Dear Jr., has been charged with murder, left many lamenting the continued lack of legislative action to address the mass shootings that have become all too common.\\\",\\\"But Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, said that while overhauling the mental health care system was important, it was \\u201conly remotely connected\\u201d to most gun deaths.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt seems to me any time, and that\\u2019s often now, we have one of these horrible murders take place, the Republicans go, \\u2018Let\\u2019s do something about mental health,\\u2019 \\u201d Mr. Reid said. \\u201cThe word \\u2018gun\\u2019 is not mentioned because they\\u2019re afraid to mention guns.\\u201d\\\",\\\"House Democrats indicated that they were likely to oppose Mr. Murphy\\u2019s bill to overhaul the mental health system.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThat bill, the Murphy bill, has become unfortunately a partisan bill, when it could have been a totally bipartisan bill,\\u201d said Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s unfortunate, because we need to get these done.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Reacting to the clinic shooting,President Obamaon Tuesday repeated his call to make guns less accessible, adding that while political debate about abortion was legitimate, it should be done \\u201cwithout demonizing organizations likePlanned Parenthood.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama, speaking in France, where he was taking part in international talks on climate change, said, \\u201cI will continue to present those things that I can do administratively, but in the end of the day, Congress, states, local governments are going to have to act in order to make sure that we\\u2019re preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies from getting weapons that can magnify the damage that they do.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He noted that such assaults, and gun killings in general, were far more common in the United States than in other developed countries. \\u201cWe devote enormous resources, and properly so,\\u201d to fighting terrorism, he said, \\u201cand yet, in the United States, we have the power to do more to prevent what is just a regular process of gun homicides that is unequaled by multiples of five, six, 10.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
