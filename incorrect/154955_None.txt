"{\"title\": \"Developer Speaks Out over Claim 'Historical Accuracy' Pushes White Supremacy in Games\", \"content\": \"Addressing Bethesda Game Studios\\u2019 open-world role-playing game The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, Cooper said, \\u201cMedievally-themed [sic] video games are a space where whiteness can be anchored, in a \\u2018happy history\\u2019 where a world is free of multiculturalism and white guilt.\\u201dThere isn\\u2019t a text version of Cooper\\u2019s full presentation, so Breitbart asked Cooper whether there were any points from the linked article above that she would like to clarify. The scholar responded that \\u201coutside of the context of the talk it\\u2019s very difficult to gather what\\u2019s really being argued. Points are elided, examples missed out, some mistakes and omissions.\\u201dBreitbart interviewed Czech game developer Daniel V\\u00e1vra on Cooper\\u2019s ideas and diversity in video games. V\\u00e1vra grew up under communist Czechoslovakia\\u2019s regime of censorship, has written for the critically acclaimed third-person action\\u00a0franchise Mafia, and is the co-founder of Warhorse Studios, which is currently creating the medieval role-playing game Kingdom Come: Deliverance.\\u00a0V\\u00e1vra recently came to the defense of Polish developer CD Projekt Red after their game\\u00a0The Witcher 3 was accused of being racially insensitive over its cast of all-white characters.@aegies Do you think, that everytime we want to tell the story about us, we need to inject some other cultures into it not to be racist?\\u2014 Daniel V\\u00e1vra (@DanielVavra) May 14, 2015@aegies Yes I am, because they weren't.\\u2014 Daniel V\\u00e1vra (@DanielVavra) May 14, 2015@aegies Oh please Mr. American teach me about our history! I was only born on the borders of Bohemia, Germany and Poland so I dont know shit\\u2014 Daniel V\\u00e1vra (@DanielVavra) May 14, 2015When asked what he thought about scholarly criticism of video games, V\\u00e1vra said, \\u201cI am perfectly okay with it. There are a lot of things that can be done better within the gaming industry and I was always very vocal about it. The video game is a young medium that is highly limited by technology but rapidly evolving. Everybody is learning on the fly. So it\\u2019s logical that there are a lot of issues, as in any young medium.\\u201d\\u201cWe are having problems with believable characters, for example\\u2026 It\\u2019s hard to have emotional dialogue with someone using just a joypad. It\\u2019s easier to shoot with a joypad,\\u201d he explained.But he continued by saying, \\u201cI see a problem with poorly researched, biased activism based on thin air. For example, the argument we hear very often these days is that Western games are not diverse enough or that there are not enough women as playable characters. When you look at the games released today, you will find that it\\u2019s simply not true at all. The majority of western games actually do have playable female characters. They let you choose your race, etc. The vast majority. But when you say it, you are instantly attacked and labeled with some -ism. That is not criticism.\\u201d\\u201cI don\\u2019t think there is some serious social analysis. Its politics,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere is a very vocal minority accusing games industry of non-existent\\u00a0crimes and giving people who dont conform to their narrative various libellous labels. It\\u2019s already created a very toxic atmosphere.\\u201dV\\u00e1vra noted an interesting trend concerning the targets that cultural critics pick: \\u201cThey\\u2019re European and US developers only. Nobody is criticizing Japanese, Chinese, or Iranian developers for the lack of inclusivity in their games. It\\u2019s exclusively about white men speaking on behalf of the rest of the world and criticizing Western developers for being Western developers without any actual data backing their accusations because, as I said, the reality is directly the opposite of what they claim.\\u201dAddressing his new game, Kingdom Come:Deliverance, V\\u00e1vra stated, \\u201cI am making a game about the history of my country\\u2026 all of a sudden there are people telling me that I should not make it as it really was, or how I as an author feel it should be, but as it should have been according to their political views.\\u201dReflecting on Kingdom Come: Deliverance\\u2019s adherence to history, the developer said, \\u201cWhen a swordsman plays our game, he should feel that the combat is as authentic as everything else \\u2013 architecture, flora, the way people lived and spoke. It\\u2019s like a time machine. A historian\\u2019s dream come true\\u2026 And we don\\u2019t try to hide anything, we are showing it with all the dirt as it really was.\\u201dWhen asked about other game developers\\u2019 reactions to cultural critics, V\\u00e1vra stated, \\u201cNobody wants to be called sexist by a mainstream magazine a few weeks before the release of their game. So everybody avoids these topics at all cost, which kills any reasonable discussion, and without discussion, there can hardly be any progress. Also, when mainstream media like TV get involved, they usually follow the loudest narrative, which is very harmful for the industry.\\u201d\\u201cEven if [developers] try to accommodate the requests, they are criticized anyway as it happened to the latest Assassin\\u2019s Creed game, which was criticized for not having a playable female [character], and when they added one, they were criticized for \\u2018exploiting feminism\\u2019 and tokenism,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cSo you try to avoid any controversy. I don\\u2019t think this is the way to create great art. Great art is usually controversial. Life is full of controversy. Art should reflect that and challenge the way we think.\\u201dBut V\\u00e1vra sees a light at the end of the tunnel in the form of gamers, themselves. He says \\u201cpeople just found that they are often being manipulated by the media and they also found how to avoid this. Social media like Reddit, YouTube, or various ranking sites are changing the way we get trustworthy information. People are starting to believe collective wisdom of other users more than media, and if media will not change, they will get obsolete very soon.\\u201dFollow Rob Shimshock (@Xylyntial) on Twitter.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 154955}"
