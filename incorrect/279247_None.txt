"{\"title\": \"Letter From Valley Forge\", \"content\": \"A number of my ancestors served in the Continental Army, mostly with New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey units. One of those wrote the letter below which is now kept in the Revolutionary Era Documents section of the New Jersey Historical Society.   The letter was written by Captain William Gifford of the Third New Jersey Regiment to his best friend, Colonel Benjamin Holme of the New Jersey Militia. I thought this 4th of July weekend would be a good time to read it again\\u2026Camp at Valley Forge Jan. 24, 1778D. Col.I should have wrote you before now, had it not been for our Expectations of going to Jersey for Winter Quarters, \\u2014 but I fancy we may give up our notions of Jersey & Content ourselves in these Wigwams this winter, \\u2014 We are encamped about Twenty Miles from Philad. at a place called the valley Forge, along the Schuylkill. The Army is divided into Two lines front & Rear, besides Corps de Reserve, and possess very\\nCommanding and defensible ground, we are fortifying the Camp as fast as possible, tho\\u2019 we are under no apprehensions of a visit from the Enemy, (Tho\\u2019 such a report is current in Camp) but I am very sensible they know   better things, if they shou\\u2019d come I trust in God we shall be able to give them a warm reception, perhaps a total defeat, We have a large Army in every respect fit for Action, Tho\\u2019 some are very bare for clothes, I wish with all my heart our State wou\\u2019d make better provision for out Brigade, respecting Clothing & other necessaries than they do, if they had any Idea of the hardships we have & do undergo, they Certainly wou\\u2019d do more us, [sic] than they do, I assure you Sir we have had a very Severe Campaign of it, Since we came in this State,\\u2013 our Men are in huts 16 by 18, Covered with Oak Shingles, and now are pretty Comfortable \\u2014 since they have got to live in \\u2019em, we lay in Tents until the 20 instant; an instance of the kind hardly ever known in any Country whatever, but what ca\\u2019t brave Americans endure, Nobly fighting for the rights of their injured country. \\u2014I Congratulate you on the arrival of 8 ships from France under Convoy of a 40 Gun Frigate at a port in Maryland, their Lading is uncertain but supposed to have necessaries for the Army. \\u2014As you are acquainted with Captain Lee of Horse, I will mention Some thing that happened [to] him a few Nights past. On the 19 ins about day break, 200 of the enemies Horse surrounded his quarters, with the intent to take him by Surprise, \\u2014 but Captain Lee\\u2019s vigilance baffled their designs by industriously posting his men in their Quarters, although he had not a sufficient number to allow one for each Window, he Obligated them disgracefully to retreat after Repeated & fruitless attempts to force their way into the House, leaving Two killed and four wounded, their Wounded they took off. \\u2014We received no other damage than a Small patrole of Horse, Consisting of four fell unfortunately in their hands, as they were returning from their post, & Lieu. Lindsay Slightly wounded in the wrist. \\u2014 The\\nCommander in Chief has returned Cap. Lee, his officers & Soldiers of his Troop, his warmest thanks in general orders for their good Conduct and Superior bravery. \\u2014 Captain Lee had in House but a Corporal and 4 privates. \\u2014Perhaps you will think I have forgot you, in not writing to you oftner than I do, I must confess I have been careless about writing, but I assure you Sir it\\u2019s owing to my not having time or Paper to write on, I\\nshou\\u2019d be ungrateful to the last Degree, if ever I forget you my best friend. \\u2014 I wrote you immediately after the Action of Short Hills, and likewise after the Battle of Brandywine, in the first I mentioned the\\nPerson at Morris-Town, which I think wou\\u2019d be agreeable in every respect. \\u2014When I shall have the Pleasure of seeing you is uncertain \\u2014 if you have a Safe opportunity send me warm[est] breeches & Stockings [take] great care of the Linen as that article is very dear and hard to be purchased,   Colonels Ogden and Martin, with a number of other inferior officers of this Brigade have Resigned. \\u2014I Shall be very fond of hearing from you when an opportunity offers, my best respects to Col. Jn. Holm Cap. Sayre, Jenny, Geo[rge] and your family & remain D. Col. your assured friend to serve you if in me lay. \\u2014\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 279247}"
