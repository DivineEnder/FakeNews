The former president also pledged to\\u00a0stop giving paid speeches, regardless of the outcome of\\u00a0Hillary Clinton\\u2019s presidential bid.Still, even after the former president\\u2019s announcement, other Clinton Foundation projects \\u2013 The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and\\u00a0the\\u00a0Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP) \\u2013\\u00a0said\\u00a0they would continue to collect donations no matter what happens in November.Bill Clinton\\u2019s\\u00a0announcement followed former Democratic Pennsylvania Governor and longtime Clinton ally\\u00a0Ed Rendell\\u2019s remarks that\\u00a0the foundation should shutdown if Hillary Clinton became president.\\u201cI definitely think if she wins the presidency, they have to disband it. I know it\\u2019ll be hard for President (Bill) Clinton because he cares very deeply about what the foundation has done,\\u201d Rendell\\u00a0told\\u00a0the\\u00a0New York Daily News. \\u201cIt\\u2019d be impossible to keep the foundation open without at least the appearance of a problem.\\u201dOn Tuesday, the\\u00a0Boston Globe, which\\u00a0endorsed\\u00a0Hillary Clinton\\u2019s presidential bid, called for the \\u201cshut down\\u201d\\u00a0of the Clinton Foundation, should Hillary win.\\u201cEven if they\\u2019ve done nothing illegal, the foundation will always look too much like a conflict of interest for comfort,\\u201d\\u00a0the\\u00a0Globe\\u2019s\\u00a0editorial board\\u00a0wrote.\\u201cThe new pledge is a stunning tacit admission of wrongdoing,\\u201d Schweizer wrote\\u00a0on Thursday, adding that \\u201cit comes too little too late and raises the obvious question: If it would be wrong for Hillary\\u2019s foundation to accept foreign cash as president, why wasn\\u2019t it wrong for Hillary\\u2019s foundation to accept foreign cash from oligarchs and countries who had business pending on her desk as Sec. of State?\\u201dSchweizer continued: \\u201cMoreover, if, as has been\\u00a0confirmed\\u00a0by numerous mainstream media organizations, Hillary Clinton\\u00a0violated\\u00a0her ethics pledge with the Obama administration to disclose all Clinton Foundation donations, why should the American people believe she would now honor a new pledge to forgo bagging cash from foreign oligarchs and countries?\\u201dThat\\u2019s a question that the Clinton\\u2019s may not have an answer to, according to those in the government corruption watchdog community.\\u201cIt is very difficult to see how the organization called the Clinton Foundation can continue to exist during a Clinton presidency without that posing all sorts of consequences,\\u201d John Wonderlich, the interim executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, told the Times. \\u201cWhat they announced only addresses the most egregious potential conflicts.\\u201dFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:\\u00a0@JeromeEHudson\", \"source_id\": 2}"
