"{\"article_id\": 340036, \"title\": \"Jeb Bush Draws on Family Dynasty for Fund-Raising Efforts\", \"content\": \"{\\\"KENNEBUNKPORT, Me. \\u2014  Maybe it was the sunset selfies on the lawn at Walker\\u2019s Point, the family compound, with the state flags of Texas and Maine fluttering in the salty breeze.\\\",\\\"Maybe it was the standing ovation for the elder President George Bush, frail but beaming, when he arrived Friday morning at a discussion of how to elect another of his sons to the White House.\\\",\\\"But over two days of lobster rolls and strategy sessions, whatever reluctanceJeb Bushmay have had about publicly embracing his dynastic inheritance seemed to vanish. And for the hundreds of donors to Mr. Bush\\u2019s campaign for president who gathered in this seaside town \\u2014 seat of the Bush family for more than a century \\u2014 the family name seemed to have few downsides.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think Jeb\\u2019s made clear that he\\u2019s not going to run away from his family,\\u201d said Eric J. Tanenblatt, who led the Georgia campaign of George W. Bush, Mr. Bush\\u2019s older brother, in the 2000 presidential election.\\\",\\\"Mr. Bush\\u2019s father, his mother, his wife and even his son have raised money for his campaign or for his \\u201csuper PAC,\\u201d tapping into a family donor network that began as his mother\\u2019s Christmas card mailing list. And now an invitation to Walker\\u2019s Point, for decades the ultimate V.I.P. room in Republican politics, is Mr. Bush\\u2019s to bestow.\\\",\\\"On Monday, he invited the last Republican presidential nominee,Mitt Romney, to Walker\\u2019s Point for lunch, hoping to soothe lingering hurt over what Mr. Romney\\u2019s supporters considered a desultory endorsement of their candidate in 2012. On Thursday, a visit to the compound was the prize for members of the vaunted Bush fund-raising operation, who arrived to the news that theyhad amassed about as much moneyas the rest of the Republican field and their super PACs combined. Marking the day, they gathered with the Bush family for a group photo.\\\",\\\"Such donor retreats have become a routine feature of presidential campaigns, all the more important as the price tag for a major-party candidacybreaks the $1 billionmark. They are intended to reflect some actual or projected essence of the candidate: Hillary Rodham Clinton gathered her top fund-raisers in May at a Brooklyn warehouse, for example, while Mr. Romney invited top donors for annual hikes and foreign policy lectures at the Stein Eriksen Lodge Deer Valley in Park City, Utah, a favorite destination of his family.\\\",\\\"George W. Bush, the former president and former Texas governor, styled himself as a political outsider, and pointedly eschewed the establishment trappings of Maine. Many of the donors in Kennebunkport recalled, with something less than fondness, their frequent meetings at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., huddled under a tent in 100-degree heat.\\\",\\\"But few candidates, they said, could compete with the Bush family\\u2019s inner sanctum, a compound of a half-dozen homes on a rocky spit jutting into the Atlantic, one of themrecently builtfor Jeb Bush and his family.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis is to the Bushes what Hyannis Port is to the Kennedys,\\u201d said Dirk Van Dongen, a lobbyist in Washington who was making his first trip to the Bush home.\\\",\\\"In his early months as a candidate, Mr. Bush seemed unsure of how tightly to embrace the family mantle. He dodged questions about his older brother\\u2019s record as president and eschewed his last name on campaign literature. (His exclamatory bumper stickers read, simply, \\u201cJeb!\\u201d) Announcing his campaign last month, Mr. Bush declared that \\u201cnot a one of us deserves the job by right of r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9, party, seniority, family or family narrative.\\u201d\\\",\\\"This week\\u2019s events in Kennebunkport, however, were rich with such narrative.\\\",\\\"Arriving on Thursday, the guests were greeted by Barbara Bush, Mr. Bush\\u2019s mother, and ushered into the main house for drinks. (The veteran Bush donors had chosen their socks carefully, in tribute to the elder Mr. Bush, known for his taste in brightly colored ones.) Later, they were whisked by old-fashioned trolley to a nearby luxury resort, where Jeb Bush promised his guests that he would not let their hard work go for naught.\\\",\\\"On Friday, the donors sat for a political briefing led by Mr. Bush\\u2019s senior campaign staff, who praised them for nearly beating the record fund-raising pace set by Mr. Bush\\u2019s brother during his 2004 campaign. Mr. Bush spoke as well, according to attendees, telling the guests he relished the closeness of the race in New Hampshire, where polls show several other candidates with a chance at winning, because a victory there could only come if he earned it. Mr. Bush\\u2019s parents attended the briefing.\\\",\\\"\\u201cYou leave saying: Not only was the next president of the United States, but the most important American of my lifetime, George H.W. Bush, sitting at my table, making me feel comfortable,\\u201d said Ron Kaufman, who served as political director for the elder Mr. Bush.\\\",\\\"Another top fund-raiser for Jeb Bush, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, had a succinct appraisal of the venue. \\u201cFor fund-raising,\\u201d he said, \\u201cit is gold.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not hauling these guys into a two-week rental in Martha\\u2019s Vineyard,\\u201d the fund-raiser said, adding that Kennebunkport was \\u201ca little bit more special than what Hillary can offer.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The guests were a microcosm of the financial operation that Mr. Bush is hoping will overwhelm his rivals. There were prominent businessmen, including Woody Johnson, the Jets owner, and Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former chief executive of Barclays. There were ambassadors and other veterans of George W. Bush\\u2019s administrations, among them Robert M. Duncan, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee; Emil W. Henry Jr., a former senior Treasury official, and Dina Powell, a former assistant secretary of state.\\\",\\\"Some fondly recalled past visits to Maine. One guest, trying to convey the Yankee simplicity of the Bush home, described arriving on a past jaunt and being offered a bowl of Fritos.\\\",\\\"But there was also new blood, making their first visit: a contingent in their 30s and 40s whom one donor called \\u201cP\\u2019s crowd,\\u201d referring to one of Jeb Bush\\u2019s sons, George P. Bush. Some had parents who had raised money for previous Bush campaigns.\\\",\\\"\\u201cEverybody respects this family,\\u201d said Jay S. Zeidman, a Texas health care executive who is close to the younger Bush generation, and whose father was a top donor to George W. Bush. \\u201cBeing here \\u2014 it\\u2019s a new phase, a new chapter.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
