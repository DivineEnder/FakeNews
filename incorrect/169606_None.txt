"{\"title\": \"Texas Higher Education Board Wants 60 Percent More College Degrees by 2030\", \"content\": \"Called 60x30TX, the 15-year plan by the Texas Education Higher Education Board targets Texans aged 25 to 34 as the demographic the coordinating board wants\\u00a0to see an increase in higher education certification.The strategic plan seeks for 550,000 students to complete a certificate, associate\\u2019s, bachelor\\u2019s, or master\\u2019s degree from an institution of higher education in Texas. Its other core\\u00a0goals\\u00a0are that all graduates from Texas public institutions of higher education will have completed programs with identified marketable skills; and undergraduate student loan debt will not exceed 60 percent of first-year wages for graduates of Texas public institutions.THECB needed a new long-range plan since the current Closing the Gaps\\u00a0ends this year. That, too, served as a 15-year campaign instituted in 2000.Higher Education Commissioner Raymund Paredes called 60x30TX an ambitious goal but believes it is achievable. He told KERA News: \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a stretch but I think it\\u2019s something we should aspire to. It\\u2019s that level of education we\\u2019re going to need in order to be economically competitive. I think we can stretch a little bit more and get even better results.\\u201dPresently, 38 percent of Texans have degrees or certificates. According to the Texas Tribune, Closing the Gaps aimed to have 163,000 degrees awarded annually by 2015. The state achieved that goal with numbers improving especially for minorities.The Tribune underscored that the state\\u00a0would rank fifth in the world in the world in educational attainment among residents aged\\u00a055\\u00a0to\\u00a064 years old, if it were its own country but drops\\u00a0to 25th place for its young people between the ages of 25 and 34.The THECB plan also accounts for the state\\u2019s changing demographics. Texas has the highest percentage of black and Hispanic students in the country. The THECB anticipates that the future 25 to 34 year-old population will be \\u201cincreasingly Hispanic.\\u201dBreitbart Texas reported that the state\\u2019s Hispanic population is expected to surpass Anglo population by 2020, increasing to nearly 2.3 times its size in 2010 to 21.5 million by 2050.\\u00a0 By 2042, Hispanic population is expected to become the majority of the state\\u2019s total population.Hispanic and black student populations have been underrepresented in the state\\u2019s higher education but \\u201care critical\\u201d to the success of 60x30TX, according to the\\u00a0coordinating board. Finding ways to help those students get into college and pay for their schooling will be vital to the state\\u2019s future, they say.Under Closing the Gaps, Hispanic participation in higher education rose in 2014, although at\\u00a0a slower pace than the benchmarks set by the THECB. Black student participation remained\\u00a0on target until 2013 and 2014 when it dropped, according to the Tribune.Workforce readiness and workplace alignment permeate\\u00a0public education throughout college and career readiness (CCR) cluster pathways and the more vocational based career and technical education (CTE). Even the\\u00a060x30TX plan was written by a committee of business and higher education leaders \\u201cwho expressed concerns that the state is falling behind other states and countries,\\u201d\\u00a0says\\u00a0the Tribune.The plan\\u00a0cites the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which suggests that fewer than 60 percent of workers need a college degree to \\u201csatisfy workforce demand.\\u201dThe higher education coordinating board\\u00a0does not stray from workforce alignment. In 60x30TX it considers that \\u201cthe primary reason most students attend college: to get a better job and achieve a better life\\u201d and it adds the \\u201cemployers\\u2019\\u00a0desires to remain competitive, and the state\\u2019s need for a robust economy.\\u201dFurthermore, it notes its purpose as strengthening \\u201cthe excellence and quality in Texas higher education by challenging the state\\u2019s two- and four-year institutions to prepare students for the jobs of the future, while also inspiring them to contribute to a greater Texas society.\\u201dHowever, the board\\u00a0also\\u00a0insists that\\u00a0a degree isn\\u2019t enough. \\u201cTexas students will need to match their credentials to employer needs.\\u201dOtherwise, Jeff Strohl of Georgetown University states in the report, these higher education degrees could up unemployment and \\u201chigher levels of mismatch.\\u201dMismatch happens when a worker\\u2019s skill set is not aligned to an employer\\u2019s needs. Breitbart Texas reported on how workforce-centric learning, middle-skill leveled jobs and vocational pursuits drive public education in the quest for these classroom-to-career skill sets.They claim that the phased out Closing the Gaps by 2015\\u00a0had mixed results, according to Commissioner Paredes. More high school graduates did finish college than before the program.However, where\\u00a0Closing the Gaps changed the educational emphasis from high school graduation to college access and success,\\u00a060x30TX\\u00a0targets\\u00a0college completion rates and workforce readiness.The Dallas\\u00a0Business Journal pointed out that Paredes told the State Board of Education in April, \\u201cEvery educator knows education is no longer the engine of social and economic mobility that this country was built on.\\u201dHe said, \\u201cThe cleavages between the affluent and the poor are growing deeper and wider. We have to do something about it.\\u201dThis echoed\\u00a0Dallas Mayor Rawlings, who recently fretted over his city\\u2019s competitive economic edge if it had a skills gap. Through the U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM) and CTE, city officials influence public education, as Breitbart Texas reported.Paredes also voiced his concerns over the \\u201cseveral hundred thousand young people in Texas who\\u2019ve accumulated 50 or more hours of credit at public colleges or universities and they\\u2019ve never finished a degree.\\u201d He also told KERA, \\u201cWe need to go back and attract those students and get them to finish their credentials.\\u201dBreitbart Texas reported on the national movement to raise\\u00a0higher education rates by salvaging credits through reverse transfer, the process of retroactively awarding community college transfer students associate\\u2019s degrees from four-year universities.The coordinating board\\u00a0says 60x30TX \\u00a0is\\u00a0about the state remaining\\u00a0competitive and prosperous and the plan \\u201ccannot be postponed without postponing the progress of Texas.\\u201dTHECB was created by the Texas Legislature in 1965 to \\u201cprovide leadership and coordination for the Texas higher education system to achieve excellence for the college education of Texas students.\\u201d The Board is made up of\\u00a0nine members appointed by the Governor for six-year terms. The Governor also appoints the chair and vice-chair.Its\\u00a0mission\\u00a0is to promote access, affordability, quality, success, and cost efficiency in the state\\u2019s institutions of higher education. The board seeks\\u00a0a globally competent workforce that positions Texas as an international leader in an increasingly complex world economy.Last year, Breitbart Texas reported that Paredes flip-flopped on his original stance over HB 5, the state\\u2019s 2013 college and career ready education reforms. Originally, he\\u00a0shared concerns about\\u00a0inferior K-12 \\u201crigor\\u201d HB5 offered in a \\u00a0Dallas Morning News interview. He felt it would lead to \\u201ca\\u00a0decline in college readiness.\\u201dParedes warned that \\u201cthere will be a decline in the percentage of low income students and students of color who are college-ready and likely to attend college. We will be less competitive economically with other states and globally, particularly in high-tech and STEM areas.\\u201dFollow Merrill Hope on Twitter @OutOfTheBoxMom.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 169606}"
