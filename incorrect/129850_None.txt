"{\"title\": \"US Denies Treaty-Bound Duty to Protect Marshall Islands from Iran\", \"content\": \"While details remain sketchy about the incident, Iranian patrol craft forcibly stopped and boarded a merchant ship under flag of the Marshall Islands. The incident raises two questions\\u2014what triggered it and what, if any, responsibility the U.S. may have, under its treaty with the Marshall Islands, to respond to this act of Iranian aggression.What is known is that on April 28, the container ship Maersk Tigris was transiting north in the Strait of Hormuz, between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the Arabian Sea. It was headed for the port of Jebel Ali, located southwest of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates when the Iranian patrol boats approached.The Tigris was ordered to undertake a course change that would cause it to enter deeper into Iranian territorial waters. (While the Strait of Hormuz lies inside Iran\\u2019s territorial waters, ships regularly transit it as an openly recognized international shipping lane under the principle of \\u201cinnocent passage.\\u201d)When the ship\\u2019s master refused to alter course, the boats fired a shot across the ship\\u2019s bow. The unarmed Tigris immediately sent out a distress call before stopping and being boarded by the Iranians.The U.S. Navy destroyer Farragut was dispatched in response to the distress call and ordered to locate Tigris. However, by the time Farragut arrived near the location, the Iranians had already led the merchant ship deeper into Iranian waters, near Larak Island. Tigris is now in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. No Americans are known to be among the 30-plus crewmembers.There seems to be a dispute as to whether, while transiting through Iranian waters, Tigris was on the internationally recognized shipping lane course or had veered off. Defense experts who tracked the transit support the former.The Iranian navy has historically had navigational problems while seeking to create international incidents. In March 2007, fifteen British sailors and marines were patrolling Shatt al Arab\\u2014a long disputed waterway between Iraq and Iran\\u2014when they were seized by the Iranian navy. Claiming the Brits were in their territorial waters, the Iranians initially provided coordinates squarely putting the alleged trespassers on the Iraqi side. After the Brits pointed this out, the Iranians \\u201cre-calculated\\u201d the position, providing coordinates inside Iranian waters.Iran\\u2019s motivation for this 2007 international incident was to draw attention away from its nuclear arms program. Undoubtedly, political motivation is again at play. As a nation state unable to act as a responsible member of the international community, Iran leaves us hard-pressed to understand its exact motivation for this action. We are left to ponder whether this, again, is an effort to take the focus off nuclear issues or, this time, to placate Tehran\\u2019s hardliners in the aftermath of Iran\\u2019s embarrassment in losing a face-off with U.S. warships that prevented an Iranian convoy from delivering war materials to Yemeni rebels a week earlier.But, regardless of motivation, the remaining issue is what responsibilities this act of aggression by the Iranians triggers on the part of the U.S. based on its 1986 treaty with the Marshall Islands.The U.S. took administrative control over the Marshall Islands following Japan\\u2019s defeat in 1945. When the Islands became independent in 1986, a treaty with the U.S., known as the Compact of Free Association, became effective, amended in 2004. The U.S. became responsible for the national security and defense of the Marshall Islands which, in turn, agreed not to undertake acts incompatible with those responsibilities.Thus, it is clear the U.S. is required to act on behalf of the defenseless Marshall Islands. But, apparently, Obama\\u2019s Pentagon is rejecting President Teddy Roosevelt\\u2019s policy to \\u201cspeak softly and carry a big stick\\u201d in order to \\u201csay nothing and carry no stick\\u201d as it believes otherwise.As CBS News reports, \\u201cPentagon lawyers have determined US has no obligation to come to the defense of a Marshall Islands-flagged vessel at sea.\\u201dThe Charge d\\u2019Affairs for the Marshall Islands Embassy in Washington, Junior Aini, disagrees with the Pentagon lawyers. He made clear the only option for his country is for the U.S. to act as required by the treaty.This brings yet another possible motivation for Iran\\u2019s action.In two weeks, Obama is to meet with regional Middle East leaders to let them know the U.S. will not abandon them. The mullahs may well see this incident as an opportunity to totally undermine Obama\\u2019s effort by showing he will not even act to protect the Marshall Islands\\u2019 security interests.This action by the Iranians serves to \\u201cthrow down the gauntlet\\u201d as it directly challenges Obama\\u2019s declared mission of the U.S. warships sent last week to patrol off of Yemen. As White House spokesman Josh Earnest reported on April 21, the \\u201cprincipal goal of this operation is to maintain freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea\\u2026this is a clear statement about our commitment to ensuring the free flow of commerce in this important region of the world.\\u201dThe Iranians recognize Obama has a tendency to declare \\u201cretractable\\u201d red lines. Iran\\u2019s actions in seizing the merchant ship Tigris is most likely yet another effort to prove to America\\u2019s regional allies they need to consider whether their own national security interests are similarly retractable by Obama.Iranian irresponsibility in acting has given rise to U.S. irresponsibility in not acting.Teddy Roosevelt must be rolling over in his grave.Lt.
