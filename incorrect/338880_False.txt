"{\"article_id\": 338880, \"title\": \"Carly Fiorina on the Issues\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, announced her candidacy Monday for the Republican presidential nomination, saying her experience running a major multinational corporation shaped her views on everything from foreign affairs to the economy. Here is a look at where she stands on some of the major issues of the 2016 campaign.\\\",\\\"Ms. Fiorina has accused the Obama administration of playing down the threat of Islamic extremism and has said Hillary Rodham Clinton underestimated America\\u2019s foes, particularly President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, during her time as secretary of state. Ms. Fiorina has said that the United States should \\u201cstand up and arm Ukraine\\u201d to fight Russian-backed rebels, and that she would order high-profile military exercises in the Baltic States to send \\u201ca very clear message\\u201d to Mr. Putin. On nuclear negotiations with Iran, she says the United States should not lift sanctions against Iran until Tehran agrees to even stricter terms on a nuclear deal, including more extensive inspections.\\\",\\\"Ms. Fiorina in the past has said she would support a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants if they graduate from college or serve in the armed forces.\\\",\\\"Like others in the Republican field, she has recently emphasized the need for tightening border security before undertaking a broader overhaul of the immigration system.\\\",\\\"While she does not endorsesame-sex marriages, Ms. Fiorina supports granting government benefits to same-sex couples. She defended the recent Indiana law, subsequently altered, that drew criticism for having the potential to allow discrimination against gay people.\\\",\\\"\\u201cPeople of religious conviction know that marriage is a religious institution with a spiritual foundation because only a man and a woman can create life, which is a gift that comes from God,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe must protect their rights as well.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Unlike other Republican candidates, Ms. Fiorina has not denied that human activity causesglobal warming. But she has argued against regulation in California to reduce climate-warming emissions, saying such actions by individual governments alone \\u201cwon\\u2019t make a bit of difference in climate change.\\u201d\\\",\\\"She has also been critical of efforts to reach international treaties to fight climate change, expressing skepticism that huge carbon emitters like China will change their behavior. And after previously supporting acap-and-tradesystem for curtailing harmful emissions, she came out against the idea during her failed 2010 Senate run in California.\\\",\\\"Ms. Fiorina generally believes that reducing government regulations helps to spur the economy, and she opposed the 2009 federal stimulus program as a wasteful use of taxpayer money.\\\",\\\"She opposes raising the federal minimum wage, saying doing so \\u201cwill hurt those who are looking for entry-level jobs.\\u201d\\\",\\\"She feels the federal work force is too large and says she would cut the pay of federal workers and base their compensation on performance. In her 2010 Senate race, she called for eliminating theestate taxand capital gains taxes for investments in small businesses, and lowering marginal tax rates.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
