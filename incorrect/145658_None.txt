"{\"article_id\": 145658, \"title\": \"British Anti-War Group: 'Islamic State Is Closer To Spirit Of Solidarity' Than Cameron\", \"content\": \"The \\u201canti-war\\u201d group \\u2013 which has been under fire on previous occasions for calling for a war against Israel, as well as \\u201cstanding with\\u201d Saddam Hussein \\u2013 has close links to the new leadership of the Labour Party, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn himself.The latest incident is the second such u-turn in recent weeks, and adds to the pressure on Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn to distance himself from the group.\\u00a0Stop The War has been highly vocal in its criticism of military action in Syria, joining with other far left organisations in openly attacking the 66 Labour politicians who voted for airstrikes against Islamic State in the House of Commons last week.Among the 66 was the shadow Foreign Secretary Hilary Benn, who evoked the spirit of the trades unions and socialists in joining the International Brigade\\u2019s fight against fascism in 1930s Spain, during an impassioned and well-received speech in favour of military action.For his stance, Stop the War dubbed him \\u201cBomber Benn\\u201d and published a blog which argued: \\u201cBenn does not even seem to realize [sic] that the jihadist movement that ultimately spawned Daesh [Islamic State] is far closer to the spirit of internationalism and solidarity that drove the International Brigades than Cameron\\u2019s bombing campaign \\u2013 except that the international jihad takes the form of solidarity with oppressed Muslims, rather than the working class or the socialist revolution.\\u201dThe blog quickly drew criticism on Twitter, and was subsequently removed from the website (although it still appears on the website of the post\\u2019s author, Matthew Carr).The Stop the War Coalition have said that Daesh are in the same vein as the International Brigades. These idiots are beyond parody.\\u2014 Matt Dent (@MatthewSDent) December 5, 2015The government really needs to take a lead and proscribe the Stop the War Coalition as it would any other terrorist supporting organisation.\\u2014 Gary Pepworth (@garypepworth) December 5, 2015The group\\u00a0was forced to perform a similar U-turn in November, when it published an article headlined \\u201cParis reaps whirlwind of western support for extremist violence in Middle East,\\u201d the day after the Paris terror attacks which left 129 people dead.That article insisted that there would be no Islamic State were in not for \\u201cAmerican crime of aggressive war against Iraq\\u201d, adding: \\u201cLet\\u2019s be as clear as possible. The hellish world we live in today is the result of deliberate policies and actions undertaken by the United States and its allies over the past decades.\\u201d It was quickly removed.\\u00a0Until his election as Labour leader in August, Mr Corbyn was the chairman of\\u00a0the Stop The War Coalition. He is now under increasing pressure to distance himself from the group.Tristram Hunt, a former shadow minister under Mr Corbyn\\u2019s predecessor has called on Mr Corbyn not to attend a fundraiser this Friday for Stop The War. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hunt said:\\u201cI think they\\u2019re a really disreputable organisation and I would hope Jeremy would step back and not go to their fundraiser.\\u201cWe\\u2019ve also seen some pretty ugly comments from them about Hilary Benn and the fact Hilary Benn should be sacked, and also, actually, their comments on Islamic State, their comments about how the French almost had it coming to them.\\u201dBut Mr Corbyn is unapologetic in his support for the group, which he says have \\u201crepeatedly called it right\\u201d on military intervention.Meanwhile the Green MP Caroline Lucas has distanced herself from Stop The War, resigning as their vice president. In a statement, her office said: \\u201cCaroline stepped back from the Stop The War Coalition a few weeks ago.\\u201cHer busy parliamentary and constituency schedule means that she doesn\\u2019t have time to fully engage with the role of a Patron and, in light of some recent StWC positions that she didn\\u2019t support, she felt standing down was the responsible thing to do.\\u201cLike the Stop the War Coalition, Caroline is opposed to British bombing in Syria because it will neither keep Britain safe nor help bring about a lasting peace in Syria.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2}"
