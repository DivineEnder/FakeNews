"{\"title\": \"Secretary of State John Kerry Urges Europeans to Do Business with Iran\", \"content\": \"As part of what the\\u00a0Wall Street Journal\\u00a0describes as \\u201cthe\\u00a0Obama\\u00a0Administration\\u2019s moves recently to help integrate Iran into the global economic system after decades of punitive sanctions,\\u201d Kerry urged European businesses not to use the remaining U.S. sanctions on Iran as an excuse to avoid doing business with Tehran.According to the\\u00a0Journal,\\u00a0Kerry told reporters, who were traveling with him to London for an anticorruption summit, that the United States \\u201csometimes gets used as an excuse in this process\\u201d by business executives, who claim the American government would disapprove of Iranian deals.\\u201cIf they don\\u2019t see a good business deal, they shouldn\\u2019t say, \\u2018Oh, we can\\u2019t do it because of the United States.\\u2019 That\\u2019s just not fair. That\\u2019s not accurate,\\u201d said Kerry.\\u201cIran has a right to the benefits of the agreement they signed up to and if people, by confusion or misinterpretation or in some cases disinformation, are being misled, it\\u2019s appropriate for us to try to clarify that,\\u201d he added.Kerry stressed that European institutions are \\u201care absolutely free to open accounts for Iran, trade and exchange money, facilitate a legitimate business agreement, bankroll it, lend money \\u2014 all those things are absolutely open,\\u201d aside from a few specific individuals and firms that remain under U.S. sanctions.\\u201cSome specific Iranian entities, including companies associated with Iran\\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, are still off-limits under sanctions punishing Iran for other behavior,\\u201d notes the Associated Press. \\u201cAnd the U.S. maintains a prohibition on Iran accessing the American financial system or directly conducting transactions in U.S. dollars, fueling confusion and practical impediments given that international transactions routinely cross through the U.S. banking system.\\u201dThe Secretary of State evidently did not explain why European businessmen would be looking for phony excuses to avoid profitable business deals with the regime in Tehran.The situation is more complicated than Kerry makes it out to be, according to the Associated Press, which reports that foreign investors are worried about Iran\\u2019s \\u201cantiquated financial system that fails to meet modern international standards,\\u201d its ongoing support for terrorism, its dismal human-rights history, and the fact that the Obama administration has been reluctant to provide written clarification of which business transactions are allowed.The WSJ suggests two reasons for Kerry\\u2019s enthusiasm as an investment counselor for the Iranian theocracy: the Iranians have been loudly complaining that the Obama administration isn\\u2019t holding up its end of the nuclear deal, and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election could put the future of the deal in doubt.At a minimum, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton claims she would add more sanctions if Iran comes too close to developing nuclear weapons, while presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said he wants to re-negotiate the deal.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 157151}"
