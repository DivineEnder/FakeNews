The researchers theorized, \\u201cWe might expect that boys would learn to support gender equity through interactions with their sisters. However, the data suggest that other forces are more important in driving men\\u2019s political attitudes, including whether the family assigned chores, such as dishwashing, according to traditional gender roles.\\u201d They concluded, \\u201cthe gender stereotyping of the childhood environment thus may help to explain the effects that sisters have on male political attitudes.\\u201d\\u00a0\"}"
