"{\"title\": \"FBI: Fake Cartel Kidnappings, Extortion Calls on Rise in Texas\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"One of the particular areas of concern is the area known as the Rio Grande Valley, information provided to Breitbart Texas by the FBI revealed. In a \\u201cvirtual kidnapping\\u201d, a victim is called by a person who claims to have a relative or a loved one under their control and demands a ransom. In reality, no one has been kidnapped but the schemers will have a person screaming in the background or use some other pressure tactic in order to force the victim into sending them money. Typically the callers are not even in the area and demand that the money be sent via wire transfer. In the past, law enforcement agencies would receive an average of eight virtual kidnappings in a month, the information from the FBI revealed. That figure has now jumped to more than 20 in June. In the recent rash of calls, the virtual kidnappers are demanding about $50,000 in order to secure the release of the victim; the victim who was never taken in the first place. \\u201cCallers, sometimes representing themselves as members of a drug cartel or corrupt law enforcement, will typically provide the victim with specific instructions to ensure the safe return of the allegedly kidnapped individual,\\u201d an FBI statement revealed. During the call, the virtual kidnapper will work to keep the victim on the line as to keep them from calling or checking on their person the kidnappers claim to have taken. The calls are usually made from an out of area phone and not from the alleged victim\\u2019s phone.\\u00a0The FBI advises anyone who receives one of those calls to take the following steps:Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas you can follow him on\\u00a0Twitter\\u00a0and on\\u00a0Facebook.\", \"article_id\": 304476}"
