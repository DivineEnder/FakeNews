"{\"title\": \"15 Journalists Have Joined Obama Administration\", \"content\": \"A wave of reporters went to work for President Obama early in the administration, a time when many media organizations were going through layoffs and Obama\\u2019s approval rating was sky-high. The flow has tapered off since then. The Washington Post\\u2019s Ed O\\u2019Keefe has semi-regularly kept tabs on the number of reporters working for Obama administration, counting 10 in May 2009, 14 in 2010, and 13 in 2011. The Washington Examiner\\u2019s Paul Beddard counted 19 reporters working for \\u201cTeam Obama\\u201d in February 2012, but he included liberal advocacy groups as part of the \\u201cteam.\\u201dWhether the number is 15 or 19, the fact that this many so-called journalists from outlets as influential as CBS, ABC, CNN, Time, the Washington Post, Boston Globe, and the Los Angeles Times want to work at the very same administration they are supposed to hold accountable is not only troubling; it also explains a lot. \\u00a0Why would anyone enamored enough with an Obama administration they want to go work for do anything that might make a potential employer uncomfortable \\u2014 you know, like actually report on ObamaCare and the economy honestly, or dig into Benghazi and the IRS?The media is left-wing and crusading enough without the potential of a cushy government job being held out as a carrot. And don\\u2019t think the Obama administration isn\\u2019t doling out these jobs for a reason. What a wonderful message to send to the world of media: Don\\u2019t go too far, don\\u2019t burn a bridge, don\\u2019t upset us too much and there just might be a lifeline off the sinking MSM ship. And obviously it is working. \\u00a0On top of this problem, you have a number of top news network executives related to top Obama officials, many of them at the center of the Benghazi scandal \\u2014 which also explains a lot. \\u00a0Follow\\u00a0 John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 153982}"
