"{\"title\": \"ISIS Recruiting Still Going Strong As They Move Into Afghanistan\", \"content\": \"Ever since the holiday season, the White House has made a variety of vague assurances that ISIS recruitment is ramping down, the flow of fighters into the Islamic State has been choked off, and the weakened terror state is on the run. \\u00a0This is certainly a development to be hoped for, but it does not seem to have happened yet. A burst of news reports over the last few days state that, on the contrary, ISIS recruiting is still going distressingly well, both in the Middle East and West. The Pentagon has also conceded that ISIS is expanding into Afghanistan, with some success at convincing Taliban groups to swear fealty to them.The bad news about ISIS \\u201cdrawing a steady stream of recruits,\\u201d in spite of the U.S. bombing campaign, came from an Associated Press exclusive on Tuesday:The U.S. bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has failed to slow the pace of foreign fighters flocking to join the Islamic State and other extremist groups, including at least 3,400 from Western nations among 20,000 from around the world, U.S. intelligence officials say in an updated estimate of a top terrorism concern.Intelligence agencies now believe that as many as 150 Americans have tried and some have succeeded in reaching the Syrian war zone, officials told the House Homeland Security Committee in testimony prepared for delivery on Wednesday. Some of those Americans were arrested en route, some died in the area and a small number were still fighting with extremists.[\\u2026] Nick Rasmussen, chief of the National Counterterrorism Center, said the rate of foreign fighter travel to Syria is without precedent, far exceeding the rate of foreigners who went to wage jihad in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen or Somalia at any other point in the past 20 years.U.S. officials fear that some of the foreign fighters will return undetected to their homes in Europe or the U.S. to mount terrorist attacks. At least one of the men responsible for the attack on a satirical magazine in Paris had spent time with Islamic extremists in Yemen.This report prompted Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) to emphasize the urgency of passing his Expatriate Terrorists Act, which would ensure those Americans who went overseas to train with ISIS and swear allegiance to the terror state are not permitted to return to the United States and become hometown terror threats. As the AP report noted, quoting the testimony of FIB Assistant Director for Counter-terrorism Michael Steinbach, tracking the movements and activities of American expatriates who reach Syria is extremely difficult, as the U.S. embassy in that country is closed, and the CIA has no permanent presence on the ground. \\u00a0It\\u2019s foolish to take chances on allowing any of these treasonous fighters to return to American soil when we have no real idea of what they did while serving ISIS, or what kind of training they might have received.Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, described the ISIS and al-Qaeda coalition in Syria as \\u201cthe largest convergence of Islamist terrorists in world history.\\u201d \\u00a0No former American should be allowed to return from such a jamboree of murderous evil.Unfortunately, some of them might have done so already. \\u00a0When asked about this possibility by the House Homeland Security Committee, NCC director Rasmussen replied, \\u201cWe know what we know, but we understand there is intelligence we don\\u2019t have,\\u201d while FBI assistant director Steinbach admitted \\u201cthis is a number we don\\u2019t know about.\\u201d Those aren\\u2019t the answers America wanted to hear.Not only would the returnees pose incalculable security threats, they could become potent recruiters for ISIS. \\u00a0In an interview with CNN last week, Steinbach warned of \\u201cindividuals who are inspired by the message of terrorist groups, and they encourage family members, including their children, to follow that path.\\u201dHe said the common term \\u201csleeper cell\\u201d was actually too\\u00a0simplistic\\u00a0to describe the threat of these recruiting networks and the unknown number of people who \\u201chave been in communication with groups like ISIL, who have a desire to conduct an attack.\\u201d \\u00a0He also mentioned that ISIS was experiencing remarkable success at using social media to recruit\\u00a0women, and children as young as 15.Even as foreign manpower continues to bolster their armed forces, the Islamic State is expanding its operations into Afghanistan, taking advantage of the withdrawal of American troops from that country. \\u00a0A report in\\u00a0The Hill\\u00a0quotes Pentagon officials pronouncing themselves \\u201cgreatly concerned\\u201d about this new tentacle of the Islamic State, which is \\u201cnascent\\u201d and \\u201crelatively small\\u201d at the moment, but harbors big ambitions \\u2013 perhaps not just for Afghanistan, but also the tribal regions of Pakistan as well. \\u00a0It is said that some Taliban groups have actually\\u00a0rebranded themselves as units of ISIS (or \\u201cDaesh,\\u201d a derogatory term the Administration has occasionally deployed because it supposedly annoys the terrorists and punctures their image.)This admission came after a drone strike was employed to liquidate Adbul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who was sprung from Guant\\u00e1namo Bay and returned to the field as an ISIS commander and recruiting expert. \\u201cHe and his associates were targeted, because we had information that they were planning operations against U.S. and Afghan personnel there in Afghanistan,\\u201d explained\\u00a0the Pentagon. \\u00a0Well, maybe it wasn\\u2019t such a hot idea to let him out of Gitmo, then.The threat of ISIS and al-Qaeda cooperating with a\\u00a0re-energized Taliban is enough to make at least one former Obama Administration official, under-secretary of Defense for policy Michele Flournoy, recommend the Administration \\u201cre-examine the pace and scope of the drawdown\\u201d in Afghanistan, \\u201cin light of what we\\u2019re going to need in the future.\\u201d \\u00a0In other words, instead of being \\u201cdecimated and on the run\\u201d or \\u201cdegraded and destroyed,\\u201d ISIS is enough of a threat to make American advisers reconsider the long-planned, much-touted withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 275010}"
