"{\"title\": \"Hillary Clinton Email Testimony Update\", \"content\": \"We submitted reply briefs (available\\u00a0here\\u00a0and\\u00a0here) to the court in response to the\\u00a0State Department\\u00a0and\\u00a0Secretary Clinton\\u2019s\\u00a0oppositions to our request for permission to depose Hillary Clinton, the Director of Office of Correspondence and Records of the Executive Secretariat (\\u201cS/ES-CRM\\u201d) Clarence Finney; and the former Director of Information Resource Management of the Executive Secretariat (\\u201cS/ES-IRM\\u201d) John Bentel.These proceedings arise in our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\\u00a0lawsuit\\u00a0seeking records about the controversial employment status of Huma Abedin, former deputy chief of staff to Clinton.\\u00a0 The lawsuit\\u00a0was reopened\\u00a0because of revelations about the clintonemail.com system (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State\\u00a0(No. 1:13-cv-01363)).In our replies, we argued, among other things:Secretary Clinton\\u2019s deposition is necessary to complete the record. Although certain information has become available through investigations by the Benghazi Select Committee, the FBI, and the State Department Inspector General, as well as through Plaintiff\\u2019s narrowly tailored discovery to date, significant gaps in the evidence remain. Only Secretary Clinton can fill these gaps, and she does not argue otherwise.\\u2026.To [Judicial Watch\\u2019s] knowledge, Secretary Clinton has never testified under oath why she created and used the clintonemail.com system to conduct official government business. Her only public statements on the issue are unsworn.Very soon after making the filings, the\\u00a0court ordered\\u00a0Clinton and the State Department to file responses to our reply briefs no later than noon\\u00a0on July 15.\\u00a0(View the filings here\\u00a0and\\u00a0here.) Judge Sullivan also ordered the State Department to be prepared to discuss at the\\u00a0hearing how much time the agency will need to search the new Clinton emails the FBI is turning over, thanks to Judicial Watch\\u2019s litigation.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 150237}"
