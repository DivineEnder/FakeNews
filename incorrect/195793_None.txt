"{\"article_id\": 195793, \"content\": \"In an interview with CNN, Wani spoke sparingly, clearly in pain at having to discuss the death of his wife. \\u201cI\\u2019m frustrated, I don\\u2019t know what to do,\\u201d he said, explaining that her trial was \\u201cnot like a legal trial\\u201d because it was run by \\u201cIslamic fundamentalists.\\u201d He could not speak to whether he believed his wife would convert to Islam before the court scheduled her execution or whether an appeal could be successful: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what is going to happen.\\u201dOn the issue of apostasy, Wani explained with more detail why the Sudanese court has charged his wife with that crime. The court claims that Ibrahim abandoned Islam for Christianity, thus committing the crime of apostasy, and has engaged in a long-term relationship outside the bounds of Islamic marriage, thus charging her with adultery, for which she is sentenced to pay with 100 lashes. As she is in the late stages of a pregnancy, the court will stay the execution for two years, enough time to wean the child.\\u201cHer mother raised her because they divorced some time ago; she [doesn\\u2019t] know her father,\\u201d Wani explained. Ibrahim\\u2019s father was Muslim, but her mother is Christian, and Ibrahim was raised and has always considered herself to be a Christian. While she has never considered herself a Muslim, her father\\u2019s faith made her legally Muslim in Sudan, thus prompting this sentence. Wani also explained that she did change religions once in her life: \\u201cShe is a Catholic\\u00a0\\u2013 she used to be Orthodox but she changed to Catholic[ism] before the marriage.\\u201dWani expressed his helplessness at watching the events unfold by noting that he was \\u201cjust praying\\u00a0\\u2013 that is the only thing, I don\\u2019t have something to do.\\u201dCNN explains that Wani was barred from being in the courtroom with his wife Thursday when the judge handed down the sentence and that his ability to function would be severely impaired by being apart from her. According to Ibrahim\\u2019s lawyer, Mohamed Jar Elnabi, Wani is confined to a wheelchair and \\u201ctotally depends on her for all details of his life.\\u201d Wani also told CNN that their young son, Martin, is \\u201calways getting sick due to lack of hygiene and bugs\\u201d in prison. Elnabi is in charge of organizing the appeal to save Ibrahim, and her case has received backing from groups like Amnesty International.Watch the interview with Ibrahim\\u2019s husband, Wani, on CNN below:\", \"title\": \"Husband of Condemned Sudanese Christian: 'I Am Just Praying'\", \"source_id\": 2}"
