It was a very interesting day. ...The individuals who were there were proud to let me know. I knew the president was going to give his speech; I thought he was going to give it at a certain time and so I thought, I think it's appropriate that I tweet 'I'm damn proud to be an American' and keep it in that space without giving away too much information.\\u201dWhile on the subject, Johnson mentioned that he hopes to run for office himself eventually. \\\"Right now the best way that I can impact the world is through entertainment,\\\" he said. \\\"One day, and that day will come, I can impact the world through politics. The great news is that I am American, therefore I can become president.\\\"(h/t Vulture)\"}"
