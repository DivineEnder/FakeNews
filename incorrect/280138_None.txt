"{\"title\": \"Bond Forever, Bourne Forgotten\", \"content\": \"In a new listing of film and TV\\u2019s coolest heroes, James Bond emerged in the top spot \\u2014 while rival spy Jason Bourne was MIA \\u2014 finishing behind the likes of young Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.In its 20 All-Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture  rankings, Entertainment Weekly listed 007 #1 \\u2014 a move not likely to please fan\\u2019s of every hippie\\u2019s favorite spy (other than  Valerie Plame), that assassin with a conscience, Bourne. In fact, if EW was going to run a Top 2 All-Time Most Cheesed Off Folks right now, it might rank Bourne\\u2019s cinematic creators \\u2014Team America star Matt Damon and United 93 director Paul Greengrass \\u2014 in that order.\\n\\nDamon or Greengrass seem obsessed with attacking the James Bond films and the character himself  every chance they get. Mixing up a bitter soup of professional envy at Bond\\u2019s legacy and success, personal insecurity at producing movies beholden to Bond and (of course) self-righteous political arrogance, both artists froth at every opportunity to brand Ian Fleming\\u2019s creation a soulless killer. Ignoring Bond\\u2019s efforts to battle terrorism and global crime, they stamp him a militarist imperialist  misogynist.That\\u2019s a lot of \\u201cist\\u201ds to heap on a fictional character, and the Damon/Greengrass  vitriol  festival seems unwilling to turn the same critical eye toward their own  non-corporeal  screen creation. While Robert Ludlum\\u2019s character is an impressive and skilled killing machine, the movie Bourne is gloomy, bitter, self-absorbed and motivated only by personal revenge and the desire to be left alone (a trait of questionable heroic value).\\n\\nBut Bourne fights predominantly middle-aged white men in suits who are part of the military and intelligence establishments. Combine that with the character\\u2019s inherent  narcissism, and he\\u2019s the perfect screen hero for the hard left.But EW left him out of their Top 20 \\u2014 a decision that could indicate Bourne is already fading into also-ran spy status as Daniel Craig and the Bond franchise flourish. In fact, whether the magazine\\u2019s editors realize it or not, the EW list is very conservative friendly, including fine, upstanding badasses like Dirty Harry, Jack Bauer and Batman. Then again, the left alienates itself from heroic qualities when it so frequently surrenders to moral relativism and the simple-minded \\u201cweak always good, strong always bad\\u201d mentality. So, it\\u2019s hard to balance such a list politically.There\\u2019s talk of another Greengrass/Damon/Bourne project in Hollywood, but that series will never match Bond\\u2019s pop culture  significance  and historic resonance with movie fans \\u2014 and that will forever burn in the guts of hard left  ideologues  who forget \\u201cit\\u2019s only a movie.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 280138}"
