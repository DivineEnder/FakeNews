"{\"article_id\": 349389, \"title\": \"Wisconsin Dems are still paying for their anti-Walker protests, writes @emilyjashinsky  \", \"content\": \"Six years ago, as a bitter winter gripped the Upper Midwest, Wisconsin Democrats mobilized for a major political protest. Demonstrators packed the streets of Madison tighter than a playoff game at Lambeau Field. They descended upon the Capitol in the tens of thousands to oppose Republican Gov. \\n      Scott Walker\\u2019s\\n       Act 10, which would curtail the influence of the state\\u2019s powerful public-employee unions.Some thought those snowy protests would launch a Democratic surge in Wisconsin. Instead they appear to have marked the beginning of the party\\u2019s decline. Since 2011 Wisconsin Republicans have been on a winning streak.In the state Assembly, Republicans enjoy their largest majority since 1957. Twenty of the 33 seats in the state Senate belong to the GOP, the most since 1970. Mr. Walker, who easily survived a recall election in 2012, won a new term in 2014. Last November voters rejected Democrat \\n      Russ Feingold\\u2019s\\n       bid to reclaim the Senate seat he lost in 2010 to Republican \\n      Ron Johnson.\\n       Remarkably, \\n      Donald Trump\\n       won Wisconsin\\u2019s 10 electoral votes\\u2014the first GOP presidential candidate to do so since \\n      Ronald Reagan\\n       in 1984.The latest evidence of Democrats\\u2019 sorry slide is the election next Tuesday for a seat on Wisconsin\\u2019s Supreme Court. Only six years after their historic demonstrations against Act 10, Democrats couldn\\u2019t find a single candidate willing to run against conservative Justice \\n      Annette Ziegler\\n       in her bid for another 10-year term.A spokesman for the state\\u2019s Democratic Party told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in January that \\u201ca number of people\\u201d considered opposing Justice Ziegler before ultimately deciding not to take the plunge. Considering Wisconsin\\u2019s political history as an incubator of 20th-century progressivism, this development is rather stunning. \\u201cThe Democratic Party has done a terrible job,\\u201d Glendale Mayor \\n      Bryan Kennedy\\n       told the Journal Sentinel. \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t built the kind of infrastructure that says to a Supreme Court candidate, \\u2018We can help you.\\u2019 \\u201dThe trend, though, goes back to the turn of the millennium. In Supreme Court races that pit a conservative against a liberal, voters seem to prefer the conservative virtually every time. In 2000 \\n      Diane Sykes\\n      \\u2014now a federal judge, whom President Trump has floated as a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court\\u2014beat progressive \\n      Louis Butler\\n       for a seat on Wisconsin\\u2019s Supreme Court. Four years later, when Justice Sykes left for the federal bench, Democratic Gov. \\n      Jim Doyle\\n       appointed Mr. Butler to the vacancy anyway. But when voters had their say in 2008, they again rejected him in favor of conservative \\n      Michael Gableman.Ms. Sykes\\u2019s win in 2000 began an incredible run of conservative victories in competitive Supreme Court races. Today only two reliable liberal justices remain on the court of seven.Wisconsin progressives have scrambled to explain away the conservative ascendancy. \\u201cBig business,\\u201d they claim, has swayed court races with large contributions to third-party campaign organizations that promote conservatives.But Democratic-aligned groups have spent millions on behalf of their favored court candidates. In 2011, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee put $1.6 million into ads in the last two weeks of the race between conservative Justice \\n      David Prosser\\n       and liberal JoAnne Kloppenburg, more than any single pro-Prosser group spent. Mr. Prosser eked out a victory anyway, even amid the political storm raging over Gov. Walker\\u2019s labor reforms.Ms. Kloppenburg was later elected to a lower-court seat, but a year ago this April she lost another race for the Supreme Court. Conservative Justice \\n      Rebecca Bradley\\n       weathered a storm of her own, fending off brutal attacks that dredged up newspaper columns she had written 24 years earlier as a student at Marquette University. Justice Bradley prevailed 52% to 47%, solidifying conservatives\\u2019 5-2 majority.On election night, Justice Bradley concluded her victory speech with a paraphrase from \\n      Winston Churchill\\n      : \\u201cThere is nothing more exhilarating than being shot at without result.\\u201d If that\\u2019s the case, Wisconsin conservatives have a lot to be exhilarated about. Even more so now that the state\\u2019s Democrats are so deeply demoralized that they appear to have given up on shooting altogether.Ms. Jashinsky is a writer for the Washington Examiner.Appeared in the Apr. 01, 2017, print edition as 'Wisconsin Democrats Are Still Paying for Their Anti-Walker Protests.'\", \"source_id\": 22245}"
