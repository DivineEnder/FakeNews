"{\"title\": \"Central American Countries Reach Deal to Help Cuban Refugees Reach U.S.\", \"content\": \"The deal\\u2014brokered between El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Mexico\\u2014resulted in the scheduling of a \\u201ctest run,\\u201d shipping an undetermined number of Cuban refugees north to El Salvador in the beginning of January. From El Salvador, they will travel to Mexico via bus and ultimately to the United States, where they will receive legal status under the Cuban Adjustment Act, which recognizes those fleeing the communist Castro regime as refugees.The government of Guatemala described the first round of transportation as a \\u201cpilot\\u201d program meant to ease the concerns of Central American nations regarding potential safety hazards in allowing the refugees to travel through their countries. The\\u00a0Miami Herald confirmed that up to 8,000 Cubans are currently in a makeshift refugee camp in Costa Rica, all having arrived there after paying human traffickers to transport them to the United States.Costa Rican Foreign Minister\\u00a0Manuel Gonz\\u00e1lez called the deal \\u201cabsolutely exceptional,\\u201d while reiterating that the deal would be a one-time effort for Cubans currently stranded, and any Cuban refugees entering Costa Rica from now on would be deported. Meanwhile, Guatemalan Foreign Minister\\u00a0Carlos Ra\\u00fal Morales noted that the deal would not be complete until the end of the pilot program, when \\u201ctechnical aspects\\u201d of the transport would be confirmed.The government of Nicaragua, which borders Costa Rica, did not participate in the talks. President Daniel Ortega, a former\\u00a0member of the Marxist Sandinista terrorist guerrilla, is Cuba\\u2019s strongest ally in the region and has refused to cooperate in helping resettle the Cuban refugees.Beyond failing to help the families attempting to reach the United States, where they are legally entitled permanent residency status, Ortega ordered the Nicaraguan army to attack the refugees in November, using tear gas and rubber bullets. \\u201cThey made us all sit down in the street, and out of nowhere they began firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Several people were injured,\\u201d Suartey \\u00c9bora, a Cuban refugee eyewitness,\\u00a0had said.Following the announcement of a deal, critics of Nicaragua argued that their position against the refugees had nothing to do with national security. \\u201cThis is probably a favor to the Castro brothers,\\u201d Mauricio D\\u00edaz, a member of the Central American Parliament, told Spanish news wire EFE. \\u201cCuba is not interested in the United States keeping the \\u2018wet foot/dry foot\\u2019 law because it incentivizes people to leave the country,\\u201d he added. Cubans are, for the most part, prohibited from leaving the country, with some exceptions: travel to friendly countries like Russia and Venezuela or state-ordered travel for doctors and soldiers.The December 2014 announcement that the Obama administration would reopen diplomatic relations with the Castro regime has triggered an exodus of Cubans, fearing that the move would give the Cuban government greater flexibility in oppressing political dissidents, rationing basic goods, and limiting government salaries. After the announcement, the U.S. Coast Guard reported a 117 percent increase in the number of Cuban refugees found trying to flee to Miami between December 2013 and December 2014.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 141281}"
