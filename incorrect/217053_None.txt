Yes to humanity! No to injustice! No to poverty! No to corruption!\\u201dSome protesters held aloft electrical cables, water canisters and shovels to symbolise the poor services that plague Iraq. Others carried empty coffins with words plastered on them such as \\u201cdemocracy\\u201d, \\u201celectricity\\u201d, \\u201ceducation\\u201d and \\u201cservices\\u201d.Despite increasing oil production, Iraq suffers from sporadic electricity, with power cuts multiplying during the boiling summer, poor clean water provision, widespread corruption and high unemployment.Sadr\\u2019s movement, which counts around 40 MPs and several ministers as part of its political bloc, organised the demonstration to coincide with the ninth anniversary of the US-led invasion that overthrew Saddam.The rally had no widespread anti-American message, though some protesters held aloft placards that read \\u201cNo to America\\u201d and \\u201cNo to Israel\\u201d.US forces, who numbered nearly 170,000 at their peak in Iraq, withdrew from the country in December, and now just 157 soldiers remain under the charge of the US embassy in addition to a marine detachment responsible for the diplomatic mission\\u2019s security.In recent years, the Sadrist movement had organised demonstrations on April 9, to coincide with the day the US officially ousted Saddam.The protest comes just 10 days before Baghdad is due to host an Arab League summit, the first of its kind to be held in the Iraqi capital since Saddam\\u2019s 1990 invasion of neighbouring Kuwait.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 217053}"
