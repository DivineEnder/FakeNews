Cummings of Maryland, released information undercutting one of Mr. Gowdy\\u2019s recent allegations about Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s use of her private email when she was secretary of state.\\\",\\\"Mr. Gowdy had claimed this month that messages sent and received by Mrs. Clinton included the name of a Central Intelligence Agency source in Libya. That information was \\u201csome of the most protected information in our intelligence community,\\u201d Mr. Gowdy said. The fact that Mrs. Clinton sent and received these materials, he said, debunked her \\u201cclaim that she never sent any classified information from her private email address.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But Mr. Cummings said on Sunday that the C.I.A. had informed the committee that information about the source was not classified.\\\",\\\"\\u201cUnfortunately, the standard operating procedure of this select committee has become to put out information publicly that is inaccurate and out of context in order to attack Secretary Clinton for political reasons,\\u201dMr. Cummings said in a letterto Mr. Gowdy. \\u201cThese repeated actions bring discredit on this investigation and undermine the integrity of the select committee and the House of Representatives.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Three hours after Mr. Cummings released his letter, Mr. Gowdy responded, saying Mr. Cummings had mischaracterized what the C.I.A. told the committee. In response to Mr. Cummings\\u2019s claim that Mr. Gowdy had redacted the name on his own, Mr. Gowdy saidin a letterthat the redaction had been done by the Obama administration. And, he said, \\u201cthe fact that the C.I.A. says it didn\\u2019t do it does not mean the material was not sensitive or classified.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cAs usual, I would ask you to completely and accurately relate the facts rather than attempt to create an impression that is misleading based on an incomplete and selective recitation of the facts,\\u201d Mr. Gowdy said.\\\",\\\"At the end of the letter, Mr. Gowdy criticized the Obama administration, which he has contended has refused to hand over documents he has requested.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI am envious of your staff\\u2019s ability to get information from this administration in less than 45 minutes on a weekend,\\u201d Mr. Gowdy said. \\u201cThis is something the majority members struggle to do on weekdays. Perhaps you would be willing to help us gain access to the information the committee has been seeking from the administration for over half a year now.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Gowdy and Mr. Cummings continued their argument in separate appearances on CBS\\u2019s \\u201cFace the Nation.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Gowdy tried to push back on the mounting criticism of the committee for using the Benghazi attacks as a way to undermine Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Gowdy said the committee was focused on the Benghazi attacks, not Mrs. Clinton or her personal email account.\\\",\\\"And he sharply criticized two members of his own party \\u2014 theHouse majority leader, Kevin McCarthyof California, andRepresentative Richard Hannaof New York \\u2014 for their recent statements that the committee had succeeded in its purpose of weakening Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI have told my own Republican colleagues and friends: Shut up talking about things that you don\\u2019t know anything about,\\u201d Mr. Gowdy said. \\u201cAnd unless you\\u2019re on the committee, you have no idea what we have done, why we have done it and what new facts we have found.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Appearing after Mr. Gowdy, Mr. Cummings disputed Mr. Gowdy\\u2019s contention that the committee had always been focused on the attacks on American government outposts in Benghazi. Four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed in the attacks.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAnd I do believe that what he has tried to do \\u2014 I listened to him very carefully \\u2014 he\\u2019s now trying to shift back to where we should have been all along,\\u201d Mr. Cummings said. \\u201cThat is looking at the Benghazi incident.\\u201d\\\",\\\"A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton also entered into the discussion on Sunday.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTrey Gowdy has been caught making yet another false attack onHillary Clinton,\\u201d said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign. \\u201cHis committee has made a habit of leaking out selective and misleading information to try to manufacture story lines about Hillary Clinton\\u2019s emails, and this time, the C.I.A. itself is challenging Gowdy\\u2019s allegations.\\u201d\\\",\\\"On NBC\\u2019s \\u201cMeet the Press,\\u201d two other members of the committee presented their own, diametrical views of the investigation.\\\",\\\"Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, drew a comparison between Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s emails and Watergate. \\u201cBut this is worse in some ways \\u2014 right?\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said that after 17 months and $4.5 million spent on the investigation, the committee had not uncovered anything new about the Benghazi attacks.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe have nothing new to tell the families,\\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \\u201cApart from that there was a private email server. That doesn\\u2019t tell us anything about Benghazi.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
