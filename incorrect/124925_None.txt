"{\"title\": \"'Hawaii Five-0' Shows Obama Pursuing Regime Change, Disarmament in North Korea\", \"content\": \"(Spoilers ahead \\u2026)Friday\\u2019s Hau\\u2019oli La Ho\\u2019omaika\\u2019I (Thanksgiving) episode, including a guest appearance by Carol Burnett (as McGarrett\\u2019s aunt), began with the remains of a Secret Service Agent named Russo discovered in a\\u00a0barrel of lye, floating off the Hawaiian coast.The Five-0 team informs the head\\u00a0of the President\\u2019s personal protection advance team. McGarrett (Alex O\\u2019Loughlin) and Williams (Scott Caan) are told that the president is due to touchdown in Hawaii in six hours for his\\u00a0Thanksgiving vacation, and that Russo was clearing houses near the one the\\u00a0President will be staying in.Obama is not name-checked in the episode directly, but audiences are told the president is visiting his home state of Hawaii (where Obama was born).They also discover that texts were sent with the\\u00a0agent\\u2019s phone after he was already dead, leading the advance team\\u2019s leader\\u00a0to be concerned that sensitive information, including the POTUS\\u2019 itinerary\\u00a0and Secret Service emergency contingency plans, may have been compromise\\u00a0because they are stored on the agent\\u2019s phone.The assumption is that with this information compromised, and the agent\\u2019s\\u00a0murder apparently being a professional job, the President could be the target\\u00a0of an assassination.\\u00a0The Secret Service\\u00a0team leader says he doesn\\u2019t have the manpower to investigate this imminent\\u00a0threat, so they ask Five-0 to find out who killed their agent and is planning to\\u00a0assassinate the president.McGarrett and Williams retrace the dead agent\\u2019s movements back to the house\\u00a0he was clearing the night before. There they find an empty house and a .762\\u00a0NATO sniper cartridge on the ground. In addition, a neighbor who looks after\\u00a0the house for the owners gives them a description of the man that is renting the\\u00a0home and tells them that after the agent interviewed the tenant, he left and was\\u00a0followed shortly thereafter by the renter.With the threat apparently confirmed, McGarrett tells the Secret Service they\\u00a0need to cancel the President\\u2019s arrival, but is informed that the President won\\u2019t\\u00a0cancel his trip. Shocked that the President would be unwilling to change his vacation plans\\u00a0despite the threat, McGarrett demands to know why the President is really\\u00a0coming to Hawaii since it\\u2019s obviously not just to spend Thanksgiving in his home\\u00a0state.He\\u2019s informed that the President will be meeting with a small group of\\u00a0North Koreans and that this meeting could lead to \\u201cnuclear disarmament or even\\u00a0regime change\\u201d in North Korea.Video surveillance footage shows agent Russo being followed, attacked and\\u00a0killed. Using that video the Five-0 team is able to run facial recognition and\\u00a0identify the killer as a gun for hire name Barkov. That information leads to a\\u00a0\\u201ccleaner\\u201d named Moreno that\\u00a0Barkov has used in the past whose modus operandi is using lye to dispose of\\u00a0bodies.After capturing and interrogating Moreno it becomes clear that the\\u00a0President isn\\u2019t actually the target, but that the Secret Service agent stumbled\\u00a0upon the hired killer who is actually targeting someone that lives next door to\\u00a0the house he was renting. Of course Five-0 saves the real target at the last minute and catches the assassin\\u00a0and the cleaner.What\\u2019s remarkable and ridiculous here is the way that the\\u00a0President is depicted as brave enough, despite the apparent threat to his life, to\\u00a0go to Hawaii to meet with this fictional North Korean group that might somehow\\u00a0get North Korea to give up its nuclear arms and/or change the regime there.In\\u00a0real life, Obama only seems to be interested in regime\\u00a0change when the regime in power is an ally of the United States, like Hosni\\u00a0Mubarak in Egypt. Obama had the opportunity to stand up for the people of Iran during the Green\\u00a0Revolution and wasn\\u2019t even brave enough to speak out as unarmed student\\u00a0protesters were slaughtered in the streets.The other disturbing element in the episode is the way the Secret Service is depicted as\\u00a0under staffed, unable to prevent the President from changing his itinerary in\\u00a0the face of an imminent threat and supposedly keeping sensitive information on\\u00a0something as insecure as a smart phone.But this is par for the course for a show that once showed Williams berate a gun shop owner for not keeping records of\\u00a0ammunition sales (which isn\\u2019t required by law) and also made\\u00a0it look like child\\u2019s play to infiltrate North Korea and get back out without ever\\u00a0encountering a single North Korean soldier.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 124925}"
