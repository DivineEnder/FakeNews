While Twitter has long championed free speech on the web and said that it was a \\u201cglobal town square,\\u201d its positioning has drawn bullies, racists and extremist groups to the service to spread their messages. That has drawn criticism from government agencies and the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, among others.\\\",\\\"While Twitter is trying to find a way to reconcile its free speech stance with how women and minorities can be targeted on the service, the company has been clearer about combating terrorism. Daily suspensions for violating Twitter\\u2019s prohibition on terrorism are up over 80 percent since last year, with spikes in suspensions immediately following terrorist attacks, the company said.\\\",\\\"Twitter also said it has expanded its teams that review reported violations, and it now moves faster to suspend accounts and make it harder for suspended users to return to the platform. The company has also expanded the number of groups it works with to counter violent extremism online.\\\",\\\"Twitter on Thursday separatelyintroduced new featuresto give people more control over their interactions on the service, including adding a filter to improve the quality of the tweets someone sees by weeding out duplicate messages or automated posts.\\\",\\\"Yet Anil Dash, a tech entrepreneur and activist, said Twitter\\u2019s actions did not solve the service\\u2019s underlying abuse issues. Even if extremist content and accounts are suspended, people on Twitter can still organize in ways that put others at risk, such as publishing and widely sharing someone\\u2019s personal information and home address.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe news about banned accounts and new tools is really good, but Twitter has been doing those things for a long time,\\u201d Mr. Dash said. \\u201cThis has more to do with Twitter\\u2019s ability to talk about abuse than it is a big change in policy.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"title\": \"Twitter Suspends 235,000 More Accounts Over Extremism\"}"
