"{\"title\": \"Media ethics writer compares Trump to Hitler\", \"content\": \"Godwin\\u2019s Law has come to the 2016 election.A commentary published Monday on the website of Poynter, a journalism institute based in Florida, invoked a comparison between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler.\\u201cCan Trump win? It seems unlikely, especially after this weekend. Of course that is what the media said about a funny-looking spewer of hate with an odd mustache who was dismissed as an awful public speaker and not a serious candidate in Germany in the 1930s,\\u201d wrote media ethicist Kelly McBride and medical ethicist Art Caplan.Rather than laughing, they wrote, news organizations need to hold Trump and the Republican Party \\u201caccountable\\u201d for what he says.\\u201cWe certainly have a more robust political system than 1930s Germany,\\u201d they wrote. \\u201cBut Trump\\u2019s racist rhetoric should be viewed in the repugnant tradition of Hitler. When you call all Mexicans rapists, criminals, losers, and the source of disease (that last claim was an old Nazi favorite), when you disparage Mexican-Americans at every turn as the cause of all the country\\u2019s woes, and when you have the money to get you message out, journalists should take you seriously.\\u201dNews organizations should not consign Trump to the entertainment section, they wrote, without directly referencing The Huffington Post, which announced last week that it would cover the candidate\\u2019s statements not as politics, but as entertainment.\\u201cNews editors everywhere will continue to struggle with the question of what to do with Trump. While he is certainly entertaining, demoting him to the entertainment pages was clearly a big mistake,\\u201d Caplan and McBride said. (In reality, The Huffington Post has continued to cover Trump as a political story.)Referencing the real estate mogul\\u2019s remarks on immigration and Mexico, the authors said Trump\\u2019s remarks might be perceived and reported differently if they were about another ethnicity.\\u201cSuch speech is a classic ploy to sow divisiveness and generate fear. That his message finds a home at all should be alarming. It\\u2019s one thing to argue about immigration policies. It\\u2019s a completely different thing to condemn an entire ethnic group. (Imagine if Trump were saying these things about Jews?),\\u201d they wrote.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 33522}"
