"{\"title\": \"Women's Rights Activists: 'Female Genital Mutilation Is Taking Place on U.S. Soil'\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"\\u201cFGM is taking place on U.S. soil,\\u201d Paula Kweskin, producer of Honor Diaries and a women\\u2019s rights activist informed Breitbart News, supporting Trump\\u2019s adviser\\u2019s earlier statements.Miller shocked CNN\\u2019s \\u201cState of the Union\\u201d panelists on Sunday by declaring that American women are at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM).Citing a statistic from Equality Now, Miller said, \\u201cYou want to talk about women\\u2019s issues? Here\\u2019s something we should be talking about. This is a fact. As a result of uncontrolled migration into this country, you can look this up. It\\u2019s a statistic from a Equality Now \\u2014 half a million U.S. girls in this country are at risk of female genital mutilation.\\u201dIn fact, Newsweek covered the issue earlier this month, reporting, \\u201cThe number of women and girls at risk for female genital mutilation (FGM) in the United States has more than doubled in the past 10 years, according to new figures released on Friday.\\u201dThe data, the first on FGM in the U.S. for a decade, is being published to coincide with the United Nations\\u2019 International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM.More than half a million women and girls in the U.S. are at risk of undergoing FGM in the U.S. or abroad, or have already undergone the procedure, including 166,173 under the age of 18, according to the Population Reference Bureau(PRB).Immigration to the U.S. from African and Middle Eastern countries\\u2014where the practice of FGM is a deeply entrenched cultural tradition\\u2014is the sole factor for the rise in numbers, says Mark Mather, a demographer at PRB who led the data analysis. There has not been an increase in the practice happening in the U.S. itself, he says.Kweskin, who lives in Israel with her husband, produced Honor Diaries, a documentary that exposes \\u201chonor violence\\u201d \\u2013 specifically, honor killings and FGM under Sharia Law.In Honor Diaries, Kweskin focused on nine women\\u2019s rights activists who have links to Muslim based societies and cultures.\\u201cThe women share their stories of overcoming and speaking out against honor-based violence, child and forced marriage, and female genital mutilation (FGM),\\u201d she explained to Breitbart News. \\u201cThe film grew out of my fascination with the Arab Spring and the role of women in advancing the cause of women\\u2019s rights in the Middle East.\\u201dI\\u2019m a human rights lawyer by training, and I have always had a passion for women\\u2019s rights, so I was drawn to the ways women were attempting to shake off the yoke of oppression. Of course, the Arab Spring soured very quickly, and I realized that women all over the world \\u2013 regardless of whether they were living in the Middle East \\u2013 were suffering from similar harms and oppression under the honor system.Her documentary has aired on six continents and in private screenings in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Iraq. The United Nations and Capitol Hill also showed her film.It was also screened on U.S. college campuses, but in 2014, it was shut down on a few campuses as a result of efforts from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which argued the documentary was Islamophobic.She said the reaction to Honor Diaries has mostly been positive, but that both leaders and the media haven\\u2019t given enough attention to FGM.\\u201cThere will be moments of interest regarding FGM and then silence again,\\u201d she explained.For instance; when the President and First Lady came out strongly against FGM, and promised a thorough study of FGM in America. But the media is easily distracted. The conversation on FGM in the US needs to be sustained so that we see actual change. Where are the training programs for police, doctors, nurses, teachers, and other first responders? Why isn\\u2019t there a proliferation of programs to engage with communities in the US who practice FGM? Why haven\\u2019t there been any prosecutions under our existing FGM laws?Kweskin told Breitbart News that she knows personally of incidents of FGM occurring in the United States.\\u201cJaha Dukureh is a dear friend of Honor Diaries who I first met during the Honor Diaries launch. She speaks out openly and passionately about the incidences of FGM in the USA,\\u201d Kweskin explained. \\u201cMany victims are silenced, but Jaha is speaking out. And the President of the United States, and the First Lady, have acknowledged that FGM is an issue in America.\\u201d\\u201cFGM is taking place on US soil and it is against the law,\\u201d she declared.American men and women should feel a sense of responsibility to speak openly about these issues in order to find sustainable solutions. We tend to bury our heads in the sand when it comes to acknowledging human rights abuses such as FGM; there is a paralyzing political correctness, which prevents us from speaking out about FGM and other \\u2018cultural\\u2019 or \\u2018religious\\u2019 practices. Culture is no excuse for abuse, and in the US \\u2013 and all over the world \\u2013 we cannot let these practices continue.Concerned Women for America\\u2019s president and CEO Penny Nance echoed Kewskin\\u2019s call to speak up about FGM.\\u201cIn my book Feisty & Feminine, I take on the whole issue of radical Islam\\u2019s treatment of women,\\u201d Nance shared with Breitbart News.In the chapter I call, \\u2018The Real War against Women,\\u2019 I discuss these horrific issues like female genital mutilation, and child brides\\u2026there are some extremely heart breaking horrific acts of abuse and evil going on against women around the world. I think that now is the time for us to lean into this conversation and to talk about what\\u2019s happening to women.Nance also pointed out the hypocrisy politics has played in highlighting this issue.\\u201cThe left wrongly believes that because there are portions of the Muslim faith that exercise extreme Islamisism [and] enforce Sharia Law on women, because these people are part of the Muslim faith, we aren\\u2019t allowed to talk about it.\\u201d Nance charged, \\u201cIt\\u2019s hypocrisy in the highest order.\\u201d\", \"article_id\": 245777}"
