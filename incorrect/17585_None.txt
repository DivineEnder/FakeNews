"{\"article_id\": 17585, \"title\": \"Walden eases GOP transition\", \"content\": \"John Boehner graced the cover of Time and Newsweek, Eric Cantor is a regular on the Sunday talk shows and Kevin McCarthy rode his \\u201cYoung Guns\\u201d stardom right into the majority whip job.But Greg Walden? He\\u2019s one member of the new Republican leadership regime who seems happy in his windowless Capitol basement office digging through House rules and wondering why Congress still wastes so much paper.His job is to reform how the House has been run, investigating everything from floor procedure to staffing levels to how congressional offices spend money. It\\u2019s a job that\\u2019s high on administrative drudgery but one with a fundamental political goal: improving the image of Congress by showing that Republicans will be better at running the House.During their transition to power, Republicans have turned to the nebbish-looking 53-year-old, who labels his hip-bound iPhone with his name and phone number, recognizes he\\u2019s not a draw on the campaign trail and talks with glee about the huge effort it will take to reshape how the House works.The Oregon congressman is a powerful but largely anonymous force in GOP politics: He\\u2019s not a committee chairman and holds an ill-defined leadership role, but he has the ear of Boehner, the incoming speaker.\\u201cGreg\\u2019s a hard guy not to like,\\u201d Boehner said in a statement to POLITICO. \\u201cHe\\u2019s as hardworking as they come and always has a smile. He demonstrates the type of servant leadership that this place needs to show for the American people.\\u201dSince taking over as chairman of the GOP\\u2019s transition effort, Walden has solicited advice from top Democrats, sought counsel from more than 1,000 Hill employees, placed an anonymous suggestion box outside his office, spoken to Republicans who transitioned into power in 1994 and met with the CEO of Google \\u2014 all while almost 100 newly elected Republicans came to Washington to begin learning how to be a member of Congress.By examining the day-to-day operations of the House \\u2014 such as printing, technology, staffing and rules changes \\u2014 Walden is illustrating how serious Republicans are about changing the operations of the institution and potentially turning around its dismal approval ratings.Changes on Walden\\u2019s radar include reworking the House schedule, allowing flat-panel televisions and electronic devices on the floor, eliminating some Capitol positions and significantly altering House committees. He warns that some of these changes will come later, and many might never get done.Walden is looking for what he calls \\u201cice buckets\\u201d of 2010. In 1994, Republicans ended the long-standing practice of delivering buckets of ice to offices around the Capitol complex: It was a small but symbolic gesture that sent a message that Republicans were going to get rid of the creature comforts that Democrats had taken for granted during 40 years ruling Congress.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
