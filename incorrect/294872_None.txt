"{\"title\": \"Wikipedia's Seven Worst Moments\", \"content\": \"Wikipedia is frequently embroiled in controversy surrounding political biases, corrupt mismanagement, and attempts to secretly remove factual information contrary to their narrative. Here are seven of the online encyclopedia\\u2019s worst moments.1. Removing Orlando from the \\u201cIslamist Terrorist Attacks\\u201d ListIn June, after the deadly terrorist attack performed by Omar Mateen, who pledged his allegiance to ISIS before shooting and killing 49 homosexuals at a gay club in Orlando, Wikipedia and the liberal media went full force in an attempt to distance\\u00a0Mateen from Islam. Wikipedia\\u2019s contribution included removing the attack from the Islamist Terrorist Attacks list, and referring to the incident primarily as a \\u201cshooting\\u201d instead of a terrorist attack. To this day the Orlando terrorist attack is not listed under Wikipedia\\u2019s Islamist attacks list, a bizarre response to America\\u2019s most deadly attack since 9/11.2. Attempting to remove references of left-wing activist\\u2019s praise for Osama Bin LadenIn May, after Google faced mass controversy for celebrating Bin Laden ally and far-left activist Yuri Kochiyama on their Google doodles homepage, Wikipedia attempted to scrub all references of the praise that Kochiyama made towards Bin Laden and an array of other controversial dictators. An editing war was started between those who wanted to portray the truth of Kochiyama\\u2019s numerous quotes of praise, and those who attempted to stop them citing \\u201canti-Islamic edits\\u201d as a reason to dismiss these facts. Numerous terms such as \\u201cblack supremacy\\u201d were also changed to alternatives such as \\u201cblack liberation movement\\u201d.3. Doxing the editor of Adland and revealing her home addressIn January, the editor of advertising blog Adland revealed to Breitbart Tech that a Wikipedia editor had been doxing her, a term for revealing personal information such as addresses and phone numbers to the public, for years due to her support of the anti-SJW consumer revolt movement GamerGate. Wikipedia allegedly refused to intervene in the matter and\\u00a0editor \\u00c5sk \\u201cDabitch\\u201d W\\u00e4ppling also repeatedly found pages for her website being defaced and removed by editors.\\u201c[The editor\\u2019s]\\u00a0MO is to delete any and all reliable sources from a targeted Wikipedia page, until it\\u2019s barely a stub, and then suggest it for deletion\\u201d, claimed\\u00a0W\\u00e4ppling.\\u201cThe editor engaged in original research in order to disprove my job title, and found a idle\\u00a0sole proprietorship\\u00a0I started more than twenty years ago to make his point. He linked a database page showing this,\\u00a0thereby linking my home address and personal ID number, on several English Wikipedia pages. Anyone on the planet that hits up Adland on the Wikipedia could now find this information just a click away.As soon as I was made aware that my home address and national ID/birth date number was linked from several pages on the English Wikipedia I logged into an Wikipedia IRC chat help channel to ask for help and what policies [Wikipedia] had regarding such information. This was in 2011. An editor in the chat explained that since the information existed on a web page, it could be linked, but he added a \\u201cnoindex\\u201d tag to the pages so that Google would not follow the links and spider the information.\\u201d4. GamerGate, one of the most biased pages on WikipediaGoogling the consumer revolt movement GamerGate will provide Wikipedia\\u2019s page on the subject as the first suggestion. However the page, which describes GamerGate as a \\u201charassment campaign\\u201d that \\u201ctargeted several women in the\\u00a0video game industry\\u201d, could not be further from the truth. Despite there being no factual evidence that the movement was even remotely targeted against women as a harassment campaign, Wikipedia to this day refuses any edits on the page contrary to this narrative, and will actively ban users that even attempt to add factual information.5. Placing a long-standing editor on trial for \\u201coff-site harassment\\u201d without presenting any evidence of such\\u00a0to the wider Wikipedian community\\u00a0\\u2014 or to the editor!In January, \\u201cThe Devils Advocate\\u201d, a longstanding Wikipedia editor was banned from the site indefinitely for \\u201coff-site harassment,\\u201d\\u00a0despite the fact that no evidence of harassment was provided to other editors by Wikipedia\\u2019s committee. The editor was never given an opportunity to defend himself against the allegations and no other details about the alleged harassment were made public to those skeptical about the ban.\\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t just trust any article on Wikipedia. Not only do you have rampant editing by people with conflicts of interest, including paid editors, you also have a lot of people who edit Wikipedia to win ideological battles\\u201d said the former editor in an interview with Breitbart Tech.\\u201cThe ways that bias creeps into Wikipedia articles can be hard to discern if you have experienced editors trying to slant it towards their beliefs. Not to mention there are hoaxers, vandals, and incompetents, who make all sorts of edits that limits the site\\u2019s usefulness. I don\\u2019t think people should avoid any article per se, but readers need to understand that Wikipedia is at best a gateway to more reliable information and it isn\\u2019t even successful at that sometimes. You may be able to find good quality articles on the site, but it is a gamble to take anything said there at face value.\\u201d6. The Grant Shapps DebacleIn 2015, British Conservative party politician Grant Shapps was hit with a major controversy after senior Wikipedia admin Richard Symonds told the Guardian that Shapps had been using a sockpuppet account to edit his own Wikipedia page as well as other rivals in the Conservative party cabinet. Shapps\\u2019 career was put in significant detriment during the allegations despite no hard evidence that the account was owned by the politician, and it was eventually revealed that Symonds was a former member of rival party, the Liberal Democrats.7. Trying To Get A Tech Journalist Fired For Things He Never SaidThe most recent Wikipedia controversy, explained here by Allum Bokhari, involves David Auerbach, a highly regarded technology columnist for\\u00a0Slate,\\u00a0and one of Wikipedia\\u2019s most effective critics. Auerbach was recently targeted by Robert \\u201cGamaliel\\u201d Fernandez, a longtime Wikipedia editor and board member of Wikimedia DC who is notorious for his extreme views on the GamerGate controversy (see above.)Fernandez sent several tweets to Auerbach and his employers, suggesting that the columnist ought to be fired for being \\u201cpro-Brexit, pro-Gamergate, anti-SJW\\u201d and a \\u201clibel machine.\\u201d Auerbach is in fact none of those things, and Gamaliel\\u2019s tirade easily flouted Wikipedia\\u2019s tight rules on off-site harassment. Nonetheless, both Wikimedia DC and Wikipedia\\u2019s arbitration committee have yet to take any action against Fernandez \\u2014 or even disavow his comments.Compare this case to item number 5 on this list, and the depth of Wikipedia\\u2019s malaise becomes apparent.Charlie Nash is a reporter\\u00a0for\\u00a0Breitbart Tech and former\\u00a0editor of the Squid Magazine. You can follow him\\u00a0on Twitter\\u00a0@MrNashington\\u00a0or\\u00a0like his page at Facebook.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 294872}"
