"{\"article_id\": 279665, \"title\": \"'American Idol' and Dumbing Down the Definition of Homophobe\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Over at Huffington Post, Jim David is positive Adam Lambert\\u2019s \\u201cAmerican Idol\\u201d loss was due to widespread homophobia in America. He pins this charge squarely on the fact that, in his opinion, Lambert is the better singer and therefore should\\u2019ve beaten Kris Allen, but didn\\u2019t because of\\u2026\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s so amusing about David\\u2019s challenge is that he gives all the reason you could ever want in his very next sentence:\\n\\nLet\\u2019s brush aside the fact that taste is relative when it comes to who has a better voice or who\\u2019s a better performer and  remember that the show isn\\u2019t called \\u201cBest American Singer,\\u201d it\\u2019s called \\u201cAmerican Idol,\\u201d and being an idol involves more than voice and performance. How about poise, which by David\\u2019s own description Lambert seems to lack?A big part of which American \\u201cidols\\u201d we Americans choose to emotionally invest ourselves  in, or spend our entertainment dollars on, has to do with being able to identify with that person \\u2013 and most of us simply can\\u2019t identify with someone who\\u2019s \\u201cover the top \\u2026 screams a lot and \\u2026 campier than Liberace at Radio City,\\u201d regardless of their sexuality.And talk about dumbing down the definition of \\u201chomophobia.\\u201dI\\u2019ve seen Tom Petty in concert seven times \\u2014 Elton John, zero. But now, according to The Jim David Standard, this makes me a homophobe because I voted with my dollars for the straight guy with the nasal twang and not the gay man with the better voice. (Though I am an Elton John  fan and an even bigger Liberace fan.)I guess this means that those of you who choose Willie Nelson over K.D. Lang qualify as outright gay bashers.   The irony is double thick. First off, labeling a huge swath of America homophobic based on utter nonsense is in and of itself pure bigotry, but we patriots owe Jim David a hearty thanks. After all, what a wonderful thing it says about the tolerance of America that someone so concerned with homophobia is reduced to wasting 1200 words on this.\"}"
