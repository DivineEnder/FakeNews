The advantage of such a piece is that spacing between letters, even the letter forms themselves, can be subtly modified.\\\",\\\"Copy editors at The Times were bedeviled in 1952 by the emergence of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Republican presidential candidate. His name was too long to fit comfortably in a one-column headline. There typically wasn\\u2019t room left over for a verb. And there was no way that the proper New York Times would ever call the man \\u201cIke\\u201d in its news pages.\\\",\\\"So we turned for help to the Intertype Company, the manufacturers of much of the equipment in our fourth-floor composing room at 229 West 43rd Street, including the line-casting machines known generically as Linotypes.\\\",\\\"Their typographers drew up a solid logotype in which the letters were ever so slightly condensed. (The difference is most noticeable in the \\u201cW,\\u201d though it can be seen pretty clearly in the \\u201cS.\\u201d) This logotype could be inserted alongside conventionally set type to provide the breathing room needed for headlines like, \\u201cEisenhower Visits Cardinal\\u2019s Home; Will Speak Today.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Times Insider can\\u2019t take credit for uncovering this delightful bit of typographical history. It was prompted by an inquiry from Adrienne LaFrance of The Atlantic, who was researching \\u201cThe Legend of Eisenhower\\u2019s Skinny \\u2018S.\\u2019\\u201d\\\",\\\"But we can broaden this condensed-a-bit story by noting that Mr. Eisenhower\\u2019s was not the last name made into a logotype.\\\",\\\"Allan M. Siegal, a retired assistant managing editor of The Times and its longtime typographical maven, said: \\u201cLater on, the same treatment was accorded to \\u2018Rockefeller,\\u2019 \\u2018Hammarskjold,\\u2019 \\u2018Westchester\\u2019 and \\u2018Khrushchev.\\u2019 They were made in both 24-point and 30-point Latin Extra Condensed.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Photocomposition put an end to it all: Linotypes, Intertypes and logotypes.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
