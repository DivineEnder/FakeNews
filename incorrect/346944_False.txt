"{\"source_id\": 22236, \"title\": \"A Brooklyn Condo Crafted in Concrete\", \"article_id\": 346944, \"content\": \"{\\\"Residential towers made from glass and steel may fit the aesthetics of MidtownManhattan, but if you\\u2019re building a new structure near historic homes in brownstoneBrooklyn, what kind of facade material would be contextual to the neighborhood?\\\",\\\"The choice of the architect Randolph Gerner was exposed cast-in-place concrete \\u2014 where concrete is brought to the site and set into molds. Mr. Gerner has such a passion for concrete that he has been studying the material\\u2019s origin and has used theVatican Apostolic Libraryfor research.\\\",\\\"Mr. Gerner has designed 10 buildings in New York using what is known as b\\u00e9ton brut, or raw, unfinished concrete, as he is doing at theWaverly Brooklyn, a 48-unit condominium now going up in Clinton Hill.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWith exposed concrete, you can craft it so it has texture,\\u201d said Mr. Gerner, a principal ofGerner Kronick &amp; Valcarcel Architects. \\u201cIt can be chiseled or manipulated to how you want it to look, so it can be very decorative.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The style is a nod to structures made by modernist architects like Paul Rudolph and I.M. Pei. At Waverly Brooklyn, a seven-story building, Mr. Gerner said the exterior will have exposed concrete pillars, which will also serve as frames for rows of gray brick.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe concrete pillars are the structural columns that hold up the building,\\u201d but are \\u201calso the decorative exterior,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Concrete walls are considered energy efficient, because the material has high thermal mass, or ability to absorb and store heat. In certain cases, developers could get Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) points for building concrete exteriors.\\\",\\\"The energy efficiency of concrete is certainly an advantage, but Andrew Bradfield, the building\\u2019s developer, was attracted to the aesthetic.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI like that Randy and his firm bring a European element to their designs,\\u201d said Mr. Bradfield, the principal ofOrange Management. The Waverly Brooklyn, on the corner of Waverly Avenue and Fulton Street, is right outside theClinton Hill Historic District, where many homes were built in the 1800s.\\\",\\\"In addition, the neighborhood has mansions that are \\u201cunique, so each street has a different look,\\u201d Mr. Bradfield said.\\\",\\\"The building, which is scheduled to be finished by the end of the year, will have studio to four-bedroom apartments, priced from $595,000 to about $2.4 million. There will be five penthouse units, including one penthouse duplex with four bedrooms. This is the developer\\u2019s first large-scale residential project in the borough.\\\",\\\"Amenities will include a parking garage with 32 automated and three conventional spaces and a second-floor terrace with outdoor grills and a dining area. The rooftop garden offers views of the Manhattan skyline and an outdoor shower.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIf you\\u2019ve ever taken a cool outdoor shower on a hot summer day, you\\u2019ll know it\\u2019s as refreshing as jumping in a pool,\\u201d Mr. Bradfield said.\\\",\\\"Highlyann Krasnow, a partner of MNS, the real estate firm that is handling sales for the Waverly Brooklyn, noted that because so much of the area is designated a historic district, new condo construction is rare.\\\",\\\"That is not the case south and west of Clinton Hill, where the build-out of Barclays Center and the Pacific Park complex has been a boon for retail on Atlantic Avenue, which will have an \\u201cinevitable transformation,\\u201d with more shops and restaurants, Mr. Bradfield said.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI told investors that I saw Atlantic Avenue transforming like Court Street in Cobble Hill did years ago,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Sales for the building, which will also have one ground-floor retail space, are expected to start on Monday.\\\"}\"}"
