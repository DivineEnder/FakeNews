Bush, Visiting New Orleans, Praises School Progress Since Katrina\", \"content\": \"{\\\"NEW ORLEANS \\u2014  Returning here Friday 10 years after this city was inundated, former PresidentGeorge W. Bushpainted a rosy picture of the recovery sinceHurricane Katrina, saying that the devastation had \\u201csparked a decade of reform\\u201d in public schools and declaring, \\u201cNew Orleans is back, and better than ever.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Visiting one of the schools that became a charter in those early years after the storm, Mr. Bush focused on education, citing the failings of the city\\u2019s public schools beforeHurricane Katrina, and the marked improvement since. \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it amazing? The storm nearly destroyed New Orleans and yet, now, New Orleans is the beacon for school reform,\\u201d he said.\\\",\\\"Mr. Bush did not address what made the flooding a rich target for critics of his administration: the weakness of the initial response to the disaster, when federal, state and city agencies were widely seen as doing far too little to help the stranded and displaced, and doing it much too slowly.\\\",\\\"Many New Orleans residents make the distinction between those horrific first days and what was eventually a robust federal rebuilding effort \\u2014 a difference Mr. Bush himself noted in his memoir, \\u201cDecision Points.\\u201d \\u201cI should have recognized the deficiencies sooner and intervened faster,\\u201d he wrote.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAll of us who are old enough to remember will never forget the images of our fellow Americans amid a sea of misery and ruin,\\u201d Mr. Bush said Friday. But twice, he said, \\u201cI hope you remember what I remember,\\u201d citing the work of military personnel, law enforcement and thousands of volunteers in rescuing, feeding, sheltering and rebuilding.\\\",\\\"\\u201cIn spite of the devastation, we have many fond memories,\\u201d he added, recalling sitting with Russel L. Honor\\u00e9, the retired Army lieutenant general who coordinated the military response to the storm, \\u201con top of one of those big ships, strategizing.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Bush received an enthusiastic response from several hundred dignitaries, students and school staff members in the auditorium ofWarren Easton Charter High School, on Canal Street, a former city school that was flooded and battered 10 years ago and reopened the next year as a charter.\\\",\\\"But in the city at large, where signs of recovery are just blocks away from neighborhoods where little progress can be seen, bitter memories of the days after the flood are still common. The overhaul of schools itself has been polarizing, as more than 8,500 employees of the old school system, most of them from the city\\u2019s black middle class, were laid off in the first year.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI guess I\\u2019m not feeling quite as magnanimous as some others are,\\u201d said Bob Mann, who was the communications director for Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, the governor 10 years ago.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe first week was awful, the second week was better, and after that, they increasingly did a very good job of helping the region get back on its feet,\\u201d Mr. Mann said. \\u201cBut that doesn\\u2019t absolve anyone, including the state, of their failures in that first week. And it should be remembered.\\u201d\\\",\\\"More than 1,000 people died because of the flooding, hundreds of thousands were displaced and 80 percent of the city was left underwater for days.\\\",\\\"Mr. Bush\\u2019s visit contrasted with the sight of President Obama walking through some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods on Thursday and saying that as much as the city had recovered, more needed to be done.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe came to realize that what started out as a natural disaster became a man-made disaster, a failure of government to look after its own citizens,\\u201d Mr. Obama said at the Andrew P. Sanchez Community Center in the city\\u2019s Lower Ninth Ward. \\u201cWhat the storm laid bare was another tragedy, a deeper tragedy that had been brewing for decades.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The Warren Easton school, which Mr. Bush visited in 2006 on the first anniversary of the flood, was the first public high school in Louisiana when it opened in 1843. Mr. Bush was joined there Friday by his wife, Laura; Mayor Mitch Landrieu; Ms. Blanco; General Honor\\u00e9; and others.\\\",\\\"Outside the school, one man held up a placard with a well-known photograph of Mr. Bush, days after the storm, gazing out an airplane window at the wrecked city: an image Mr. Bush later said he came to regret. Below the picture, the man had written, \\u201cYou\\u2019re Early \\u2014 Come Back in a Week.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But the former president\\u2019s visit got a warmer response from some unexpected quarters.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI think it\\u2019s wonderful,\\u201d said former Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat and the mayor\\u2019s sister, who joined Mr. Bush at the school and praised him for supporting New Orleans\\u2019s education overhaul.\\\",\\\"Ms. Blanco, a Democrat, joined Mr. Bush and the city\\u2019s mayor at the time, Ray Nagin, as the subjects of intense criticism in Hurricane Katrina\\u2019s aftermath. On Friday, she recalled those early days, when Mr. Bush\\u2019s senior adviser, Karl Rove, falsely accused her of not having signed a disaster declaration before the storm\\u2019s landfall, and when the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency at the time, Michael Brown, promised buses that did not arrive.\\\",\\\"But she said she did not hold that against Mr. Bush personally.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI always thought his heart was in it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut I didn\\u2019t think he was well served by the people around him.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Blanco said that she had had a \\u201cnice visit\\u201d last year when Mr. Bush went to Lafayette, La., but that she had never discussed that period with him in any depth. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to talk with him at length someday,\\u201d she said.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
