"{\"title\": \"Todd: Hillary Released Tax and Med Records Because They Can't Explain Emails\", \"content\": \"NBC\\u2019s \\u201cMeet the Press\\u201d host Chuck Todd argued that Hillary Clinton releasing her tax returns and medical records feels like \\u201ca diversionary tactic\\u201d because \\u201cthey don\\u2019t have a good explanation on these emails\\u201d on Friday\\u2019s \\u201cHugh Hewitt Show.\\u201dTodd stated, in response to a question on Hillary\\u2019s emails, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad you\\u2019re focused on the emails, because I feel like, this is the one time that tax returns and medical records, I feel like are a diversionary tactic on the political bench \\u2013\\u201c.He continued, \\u201cYou know, this is \\u2014 there is \\u2014 they don\\u2019t have a good explanation on these emails. They just don\\u2019t. And you know they don\\u2019t have a good explanation? Because look at the backflips and contortions that the current State Department and the administration [are] having in trying to do deal with it. You know, they\\u2019re trying, you can tell, because they\\u2019re obviously favorable to her, a Democratic administration. They don\\u2019t want to fully embarrass her, but they\\u2019re struggling in figuring out how to justify some of these things. And justify how\\u2013where the classified \\u2014 you know, how \\u2014 what was classified, when. And they\\u2019re trying to actually, it seems like take some of the heat off of her, but to me the heat\\u2019s all on her.\\u201dTodd further said, \\u201cThe only reason we\\u2019re in this situation is because she chose to have this private server. \\u2026 David\\u00a0Petraeus had a do a plea. You know why? And his \\u2014 most of his classified documents, by the way, according to my sources, were his schedule, because his schedule\\u2019s technically classified. And he just, you know, his career is changed forever, let\\u2019s just say.\\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 199764}"
