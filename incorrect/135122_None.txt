"{\"article_id\": 135122, \"content\": \"The research\\u00a0published by the Halle Institute for Economic Research (IWH) \\u00a0shows that the Greek debt crisis resulted in a reduction in rates for bonds issued by Germany\\u2019s federal government to finance spending. This yielded interest savings of more than three per cent of Germany\\u2019s gross domestic product during the period 2010 to 2015.The research showed that when\\u00a0investors identify crisis and turmoil in financial markets\\u00a0they typically seek a safe haven to stash their money in. Described as an \\u201cexport champion\\u201d and \\u201cthe eurozone\\u2019s effective paymaster\\u201d by AFP, the research shows Germany \\u201cdisproportionately benefited\\u201d from that during the Greek debt crisis:\\u201cAny time there was bad news about Greece, yields on German government bonds fell, and any time there was good news about Greece, German government bond yields rose.\\u201dEvents from which Germany benefited identified in the research included when Syriza\\u2019s victory in the general election became likely; when the new Tsipras government walked away from talks with the European Central Bank, European Union and International Monetary Fund; when the Greek government decided to hold a referendum on the bailout terms; and the subsequent result of that referendum.The research states\\u00a0that Germany\\u2019s\\u00a0balanced budget was possible in large part only because of interest savings accrued\\u00a0the Greek debt crisis. The United States, France and the Netherlands also benefited from the same effect on their bonds, but to a lesser extent.The effect of all this is twofold.First, if Greece fails to pay back any of the money owed and ultimately defaults on all its debts, Germany will still come out in profit.The reports suggests\\u00a0Germany\\u2019s share\\u00a0of\\u00a0the Greek bailout package amounts to no more than\\u00a0\\u20ac90 billion so what it calls \\u201cthe maximal uncertain and future costs of bailing out Greece to Germany\\u201d are in fact smaller than the\\u00a0\\u20ac100 billion\\u00a0benefits already accrued. It concludes: \\u201cIf Greece does pay or pays at least in part, the savings [to Germany] are substantial.\\u201dSecondly, it casts light on elements of German policy throughout the Greek debt crisis which have already been highlighted by Greece\\u2019s former Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis.If one looks for a motive for why Germany has not wanted to help Greece then the conclusions of the research provide that. Furthermore, they suggest Germany maintains a vested interest in not sorting the problem out any time soon.Seeing how Varoufakis described the prospects for a third Greek bailout in his recent El Pais interview, it appears he agrees:\\u201cThis is a program designed to fail. And so it will fail. It\\u2019s not easy for an architect to build a solid building, but it\\u2019s easy for him or her to construct a building that will collapse. Anyone can do it. It was planned to fail, because, let\\u2019s face it: [German Finance Minister] Wolfgang Sch\\u00e4uble\\u00a0is not interested in an agreement that works. He categorically stated that he wanted to redesign the eurozone and part of that redesign is that Greece should be thrown out of the eurozone.\\u201dGermany would probably not benefit long term from a complete collapse of Greece, but Varoufakis\\u2019 colourful description of how his country has been treated since 2010, \\u201cfiscal waterboarding\\u201d, suggests that maintaining the advantage to the German budget is possible:\\u201cIt is a precise, an accurate description of what has been happening for years now. What is waterboarding? You take a subject, you push his head in the water until he suffocates but, at some point, before death comes you stop. You pull the head out just in time, before asphyxiation is complete, you allow the subject to take a few deep breaths, and then you push the head again in the water. You repeat until he\\u2026 confesses.\\u201cFiscal waterboarding, on the other hand, is obviously not physical, it\\u2019s fiscal. But the idea is the same and it is exactly what happened to successive Greek governments since 2010.\\u201dSch\\u00e4uble\\u00a0has\\u00a0repeatedly\\u00a0opposed a Greek debt write-down while pointing to his\\u00a0German\\u00a0government\\u2019s balanced budget. For so long as he can continue holding out against the former to the detriment of Greece, the prospects for the latter look good. As Varoufakis said of the recent bailout negotiations:\\u201cThis was nothing but a coup. In 1967 there were the tanks and in 2015 there were the banks.\\u201d\", \"title\": \"Germany Profited \\u20ac100 Billion From Greek Debt Crisis\", \"source_id\": 2}"
