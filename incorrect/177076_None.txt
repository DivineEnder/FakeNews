"{\"title\": \"Is HuffPo Threatening Political Pressure in Gladney Case on Behalf of SEIU?\", \"content\": \"We\\u2019ve already noted how two HuffPo reporters ran defense for SEIU: First there was Erica Payne,  HuffPo blogger, lover of all things Media Matters, who appeared on Fox News to try to shift blame of SEIU antics onto the tea party.We\\u2019ve also read how HuffPo blogger Arthur Delaney was embedded with SEIU to cover their  home invasion of Bank of America employee Greg Baer which terrified Baer\\u2019s young son who hid in the bathroom (we\\u2019re still waiting for the  Carnahan Coffin-Gate drama queens to repeat their hysterics over this but so far, nothing); Delaney  became the first to parrot SEIU\\u2019s baseless accusation of \\u201cconflict of interest\\u201d at Fortune columnist Nina Easton after she  published her firsthand account, as Baer\\u2019s neighbor, of the same protest. Monday we exposed Huffington Post\\u2019s own conflict of interest when we discovered that SEIU had paid the site $15,000 categorized as \\u201cpolitical activities and lobbying.\\u201dIs this what SEIU money is buying? Two HuffPo bloggers running their media defense? Of course, this could be a routine advertising expense. But, Big Government has learned that the Huffington Post has inserted themselves into SEIU\\u2019s most notorious violent incident: the Kenneth Gladney beating of last August.Earlier this month at rally was staged on behalf of the men accused of assaulting Gladney. Defendant Elston McCowan spoke, along with others who are pressuring the county prosecutor\\u2019s office to drop the charges against the men. We know that SEIU took care of Perry Molens and McCowan criminal legal expenses despite their claim of having sent no staff to the townhall. This information came directly from McCowan  writing in an email that \\u201c[SEIU] is paying for my legal fees in defending myself and any others charged with assault associated with the Union.\\u201d That\\u2019s exactly the kind of thing you want to get a handle on before it\\u2019s repeated in the mainstream press.During this rally, a woman named Jeanine Molloff identified herself as being with Huffington Post and took to the megaphone to apparently speak on behalf of the website declaring: \\u201cWe will be following this and we will make it a civil rights issue.\\u201d She even joined in the chant popularized by Jesse Jackson and Maxine Waters in the wake of the Los Angeles riots: \\u201cNo justice! No peace!\\u201dIt\\u2019s interesting to note that there exists a Jeanine Molloff who  signed a 9/11 Truther petition:Like HuffPo\\u2019s Jeanine Molloff who  describes herself as \\u201ca veteran urban educator,\\u201d the signer on the truther site describes herself as an \\u201cEducator & Online Journalist\\u201d and writes:\\n\\nUnlike certain media outlets, Big Government won\\u2019t assume, without 100% certainty, that these two same-named, same-profession, same city women are the same person; we merely think that the similarity is interesting. What\\u2019s more fascinating than a possible 9-11 Truther and HuffPo journalist threatening political pressure to influence a county prosecutor to drop criminal charges against the staff of SEIU?Is Huffington Post running defense for SEIU?  SEIU\\u2019s insurance carrier is allegedly paying workmen\\u2019s comp for McCowan, which, for that to be possible, means that McCowan was considered a working staffer the night that Gladney was beaten, there for the townhall as part of his job. It would look horrible for an SEIU worker to be convicted of assault while on the clock at the direction of SEIU. And then to have OFA,  the campaign arm of the White House  ordered for a push back at townhalls (more) \\u2013 it\\u2019s no wonder that Huffington Post and Media Matters want these charges dropped before the trial.  The question is whether or not the aforementioned $15,000 paid to Huffington Post under the category of \\u201cpolitical activities and lobbying\\u201d was for such a purpose.Due to the above mentioned precedence that the Huffington Post has with the Baer incident, I\\u2019m curious as to whether or not the Huffington Post blogger\\u2019s speech on behalf of the website and her energetically supportive presence at the rally signifies that HuffPo has a working relationship with SEIU.If true, it would seem that $15k goes a long way in new media lobbying (or advertising).\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 177076}"
