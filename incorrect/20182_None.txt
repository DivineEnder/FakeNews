David Vitter will have ample funds \\u2014 $4.4 million \\u2014 to spend on his campaign to fend off Democratic Rep. Charlie Melancon in the final four weeks of the Louisiana Senate race.Vitter\\u2019s $1.2 million haul from the past three months all but ensures he\\u2019ll have the upper hand over Melancon in this race.The seat held by the Louisiana Republican was originally seen as ripe for a Democratic pickup, due mostly to a series of scandals that plagued his first term in the Senate. But with less than a month remaining until Election Day, Vitter is on solid ground \\u2013 with a substantial war chest to spend on ads and already leading by double digits in independent polls.A Melancon aide declined to comment on the Democrat\\u2019s most recent fundraising numbers, but as of Aug. 8, the campaign reported having $2.23 million in the bank.The Democratic nominee has pulled out all the stops in the last few weeks, including releasing a two-minute advertisement with audio of a New Orleans prostitute detailing a night she says she spent with Vitter. The congressman has run a series of ads highlighting other controversies tied to Vitter, including the legal troubles of one of the senator\\u2019s former aides, Brent Furer, who was accused of assaulting his former girlfriend and convicted of drunk driving. Vitter\\u2019s office paid for several trips for Furer to go to Louisiana while he worked for him \\u2013 at least two of which coincided with his court dates in the state to address some of those charges.Vitter\\u2019s office maintains that it was not aware of Furer\\u2019s legal troubles, except for the matter with his former girlfriend, for which it says Furer was reprimanded appropriately.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
