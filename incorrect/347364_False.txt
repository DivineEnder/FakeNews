She has held the post since 2010, 13 years after she was first elected to Parliament.\\\",\\\"She is considered a moderate in the Conservative Party and has been compared to Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany; both are known for their pragmatism. As home secretary, Ms. May was criticized for failing to meet a Conservative pledge to sharply reduce the net number of immigrants to Britain.\\\",\\\"Though Ms. May supported Prime Minister David Cameron\\u2019s stance in favor of remaining in the European Union, she said little publicly during the referendum campaign, leading to some speculation that she privately favored leaving, known as Brexit. That ambiguity helped her to emerge as a compromise candidate who might promise to unify the party\\u2019s factions.\\\",\\\"She has ruled out holding a second referendum,sayingthat the people have spoken and that \\u201cBrexit means Brexit.\\u201d Still, she is not in a hurry: She said she would not invoke the legal mechanism that begins the withdrawal process until later in the year.\\\",\\\"Ms. May has said that people want more than just a \\u201cBrexit P.M.,\\u201d and has pledged \\u201ca bold new positive vision for the future of our country, a country that works not for a privileged few but for every one of us.\\u201d She has promised to address inequality, give workers greater representation on corporate boards and limit tax cuts.\\\",\\\"Like Britain\\u2019s first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, Ms. May was born into a middle-class family. She was educated at Oxford, where she belonged to the Conservative Association and the Oxford Union, a debating society known for producing future leaders.\\\",\\\"At a Conservative Association dance in 1976, she was introduced to Philip May, her future husband, by Benazir Bhutto, a fellow student who would go on to become the first female prime minister of Pakistan.\\\",\\\"To relax, Ms. May has said she enjoys cooking (she owns more than 100 cookbooks) and taking long walks in the countryside.\\\",\\\"She is known for hereclectic footwear, and often wears leopard-print shoes.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
