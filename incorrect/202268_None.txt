Might it have added to anyone\\u2019s understanding of the background to the conflict if \\u2013 as he did in Gaza \\u2013 Ban had visited a school where several children had been killed and lamented the loss of their innocent lives?Of course it wouldn\\u2019t because the impression given would have been deeply misleading. The sympathies of most people watching the footage would naturally be drawn to the victims of this carnage. And their natural antipathy would be directed at the people most apparently responsible for this destruction: in this case, the Allies.So it is with Ban\\u2019s visit to Gaza. The United Nations is supposed to be a neutral arbiter on international affairs. But from this latest press stunt there can only have been one victor: not Israel which took every reasonable precaution to prevent the civilian casualties Ban laments; but the vicious terrorist organisation which provoked the war and was cynically complicit in so many of the deaths attributed to Israel, up to and including the brutal murder of innocent children \\u2013 Hamas.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 202268}"
