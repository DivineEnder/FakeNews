One shot shows Stephen K. Bannon, who temporarily stepped down as executive chairman of Breitbart News, standing in front of a mural depicting the Constitution and Bill of Rights.Last month, Breitbart News was read by a record 31 million people.Hillary Clinton described\\u00a0KKK recruiter Robert Byrd as her \\u201cmentor.\\u201dPastor Mark Burns, who is black, from the Trump camp condemned the tactic: Hillary Clinton and her campaign went to a disgusting new low today as they released a video tying the Trump Campaign with horrific racial images. This type of rhetoric and repulsive advertising is revolting and completely beyond the pale. I call on Hillary Clinton to disavow this video and her campaign for this sickening act that has no place in our world.\"}"
