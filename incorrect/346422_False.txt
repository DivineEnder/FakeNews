"{\"content\": \"{\\\"SAN JOSE, Calif. \\u2014Donald J. Trumpunleashed an attack onHillary Clintonon Thursday in response to her speech earlier in the day criticizing his foreign policy positions.\\\",\\\"Speaking at a campaign rally here, he began by calling her speech \\u201cpathetic,\\u201d dismissing it as a stunt and saying, \\u201cIt had nothing to do with foreign policy.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Outside the event, protesters, some brandishing Mexican flags, clashed violently with Mr. Trump\\u2019s supporters.\\\",\\\"Videos taken at the scene showed a number of physical confrontations. In one, a supporter wearing a football jersey emblazoned with Mr. Trump\\u2019s name was pelted with eggs. Another showed an unsuspecting man being surrounded by protesters and punched in the face.\\\",\\\"In a third video, a man who had emerged from the event holding a Trump sign was struck in the head and began to bleed.\\\",\\\"The San Jose Police Department said in a brief statement that it had made \\u201ca few arrests\\u201d after the rally and that one police officer had been assaulted. It said more details would be provided on Friday.\\\",\\\"In his speech, Mr. Trump continued his attack on Mrs. Clinton, accusing her of secretly hating President Obama.\\\",\\\"\\u201cRemember, Hillary Clinton used to hate Obama,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cShe used to hate him. The old Clinton hated him.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He mocked Mrs. Clinton and her husband, saying they bowed to the president\\u2019s whims: \\u201cYes, sir, Mr. President, sir. What would you like? What would you like me to say, sir?\\u201d The crowd roared.\\\",\\\"He argued that Mrs. Clinton was supportive of Mr. Obama only because of the investigation into her private email server.\\\",\\\"\\u201cAnything Obama wants, she\\u2019s going forward with,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cBecause you know why? She doesn\\u2019t want to go to jail. That\\u2019s why.\\u201d\\\",\\\"That line of attack closely aligns with the writing of Ed Klein, the conservative author whose books on Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have been dismissed by critics as including fabricated accounts of events. Mr. Trump recentlymet with Mr. Klein.\\\",\\\"Though he offered some lighthearted jokes about the crowd size being affected by the N.B.A. finals nearby, Mr. Trump seemed to grow angrier during the speech and repeatedly went after Mrs. Clinton.\\\",\\\"He did not offer many direct rebukes of Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s speech, sticking mainly to mocking the candidate and focusing on her emails, but he criticized her claim that Russia and China were \\u201cjealous\\u201d of the United States\\u2019 relationships with its allies.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey\\u2019re not jealous; they think we\\u2019re stupid,\\u201d Mr. Trump said.\\\",\\\"He also accused Mrs. Clinton of lying when she said he would allow Japan to have nuclear weapons; in aninterview this year, though, he said he was open to it.\\\",\\\"And he once again proclaimed that he was against the Iraq invasion, although audio from 2002 has surfaced of Mr. Trumpsupporting the invasion.\\\",\\\"\\u201cHillary said, \\u2018Oh, Donald Trump, his finger on the button,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cI\\u2019m the one who didn\\u2019t want to go in Iraq, folks.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He promised to make Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s email server an issue on the campaign trail, repeatedly calling her \\u201cguilty as hell\\u201d and hinting that under a President Trump, \\u201cthe attorney general is going to take a very good look\\u201d at the issue.\\\",\\\"Mr. Trump was active on Twitter after the event but did not comment on the violence.\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 346422, \"title\": \"Donald Trump Rebukes Hillary Clinton as Clash Erupts Outside Event\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
