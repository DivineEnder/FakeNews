"{\"article_id\": 343762, \"title\": \"Trump\\u2019s Solo Act Gets Cable\\u2019s Attention, but Not All of It\", \"content\": \"{\\\"Cable news stations were fixated for two days overDonald J. Trump\\u2019s decision to pull out of Fox News\\u2019sRepublican debate, so much so that many anticipated he might provide stiff competition for Fox on Thursday night when he staged his own event inIowaat the same time. But if Mr. Trump was hoping for uninterrupted live coverage of his event from Fox\\u2019s cable news rivals, he did not get it, as both CNN and MSNBC broke away from his appearance about 15 minutes after it started.\\\",\\\"MSNBC and CNN briefly provided live coverage of the event, which honored and raised money for veterans, before breaking away to round tables, interviews and analysis.\\\",\\\"Still, the discussion did largely center on Mr. Trump\\u2019s decision to skip the debate, and what effect that would have on his prospects inIowa.\\\",\\\"On MSNBC, Rachel Maddow began to speak over a live video of Mr. Trump, as she noted that he was reverting to his \\u201cstandard stump speech,\\u201d before she waved her hand.\\\",\\\"\\u201cGoodbye, it\\u2019s O.K., goodbye, bye Mr. Trump, goodbye,\\u201d she said, as Mr. Trump disappeared from the screen. \\u201cThat felt great.\\u201d\\\",\\\"As MSNBC broke away, CNN, which had moved onto the first series of commercial breaks, effectively gave it up at the same time, about 15 minutes after Mr. Trump began speaking. Don Lemon, who was anchoring the coverage on CNN, wound up talking to a series of interview subjects instead, at times with Mr. Trump on the screen, muted, in the background.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWe\\u2019ll dip in as soon as Donald Trump starts to talk about policy or other issues,\\u201d Mr. Lemon said, as Mr. Trump was introducing some veterans at 9:45 p.m.\\\",\\\"Shortly before Mr. Trump took the stage, it looked as if things would proceed differently. Both cable networks appeared poised to show his event and make something of a ratings land grab against Fox, the No. 1 network in cable news by a wide margin. Fox received 24 million viewers the last time it broadcast a Republican debate, in August.\\\",\\\"For instance, a half-hour before the debate began, CNN aired a recorded interview from Mr. Trump\\u2019s jet, as he explained why he was not appearing on Fox News on Thursday night. After the debate began, but shortly before Mr. Trump took the stage, graphics on both CNN and MSNBC suggested fastidious coverage. CNN: \\u201cAwaiting Trump Event\\u201d; MSNBC: \\u201cAwaiting Start of Trump Veterans Event.\\u201d\\\",\\\"It wasn\\u2019t to be. Right before 10 p.m., Ms. Maddow moved on entirely, talking about the Flint, Mich., water crisis, where she had anchored a town hall-style event.\\\",\\\"Both networks provided media analysis of Mr. Trump\\u2019s appearance, which the candidate claimed raised $5 million for veterans. Lawrence O\\u2019Donnell of MSNBC described it as a \\u201cdecidedly boring event\\u201d a little after 10 p.m. On CNN, Ryan Lizza, a writer for The New Yorker and a CNN contributor, said of Mr. Trump, \\u201cHe picked a strange night to produce the most boring event of his campaign.\\u201d\\\",\\\"At 10:13 p.m., a little less than an hour after the rival event began, CNN showed Mr. Trump walking off the stage, but the network\\u2019s attention was elsewhere. Mr. Lemon had to interrupt a CNN contributor, Van Jones, to inform viewers that it was happening at all.\\\",\\\"\\u201cStand by,\\u201d Mr. Lemon said. \\u201cI just want to check in for just a moment. Donald Trump looks like he\\u2019s leaving the stage to applause. Yeah. They\\u2019re singing him off. Adele. \\u2018Rolling in the Deep.\\u2019 \\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
