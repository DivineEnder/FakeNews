The location corresponded to allegations of mass casualties.The coalition, which is backing Iraqi troops that are engaged in fierce fighting to retake the entire city from Islamic State, said it is investigating to determine if the strike caused several houses to collapse, trapping what local officials said could be up to 200 people.It wasn\\u2019t possible to independently verify the cause of the blast.On Sunday, an official with Iraq\\u2019s civil-defense authority said it had recovered 172 victims so far from a cluster of collapsed homes in the Mosul al-Jadeeda neighborhood that is at the center of the blast probe.The blast, and the possible U.S.-led coalition role in it, has brought into focus the extreme dangers the latest push to root out Islamic State from Mosul poses to an estimated half million people believed to be trapped by the combat. Civilians face increasingly harrowing conditions\\u2014with dwindling food, clean water and fuel supplies\\u2014and those who flee often dodge crossfire between Islamic State and Iraqi forces.After reaching a muddy field designated as a receiving center outside Mosul, Ahmed Khadim, from the Wadi Hajar district, spoke of hunger and the constant blasts that ruined his hearing.\\u201cWe were running out of food supplies day after day,\\u201d said the 33-year-old motorcycle mechanic. \\u201cThe whole family at some point shared just one loaf of bread.\\u201dSome 201,000 people have managed to escape western Mosul, according to the Iraqi government. Many have emerged with stories of leaving behind relatives buried under rubble from blasts\\u2014whether militant bombs or mortars or government-allied strikes.Iraqi troops have been battling Islamic State in western Mosul since mid-February, after wresting back eastern Mosul from the extremist group in late January. The overall campaign to recapture Mosul began in mid-October.Iraq\\u2019s government has refused to release casualty figures, but statistics compiled by independent groups have shown the battle for western Mosul has been far deadlier for civilians than in eastern Mosul. The Iraqi Observatory for Human Rights said since February 19, 3,864 civilians have been killed in the west, compared with 2,190 killed in the three months of fighting in the east.Iraqi politicians have raised questions over the military tactics Iraq\\u2019s security forces and their U.S.-led coalition advisers have employed in the heavily populated city. Iraq\\u2019s speaker of parliament said the Mosul al-Jadeeda incident would be the subject of a special session this week. Iraq\\u2019s defense ministry said it had launched a probe.According to a U.S. military news release from March 17, the coalition conducted four strikes in Mosul targeting numerous Islamic State positions, weapons systems, vehicles and a car bomb.The coalition\\u2019s Saturday statement didn\\u2019t specify which of those strikes was found to have taken place in Mosul al-Jadeeda. Local residents and officials said the civilian deaths were clustered in four homes, but the level of destruction made it difficult to determine which house was apparently targeted.If confirmed that the strike killed the civilians, it would represent the largest death toll by a U.S.-led coalition airstrike since its air campaign against Islamic State began in August 2014.The allegations come just days after the U.S. said it was investigating two recent reports of mass civilian casualties caused by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes in Syria targeting Islamic State and al Qaeda.The U.S. military\\u2019s pace of operations has increased considerably in both countries, raising questions about the effects.Faster approvals for coalition airstrikes have sped up attacks against the extremist group, but also raised concerns about risk to civilians.Two senior Iraqi officers from two separate branches of the security forces overseeing the fight in western Mosul said their American advisers have loosened the rules of engagement on airstrikes since President \\n      Donald Trump\\n       took office.\\u201cThe coalition has been merciless,\\u201d said one of the officers, a senior commander in the Federal Police, praising the change. The officer said his requests for airstrikes have been approved by a major on a company level, eliminating a review period that required strike requests to go through a command center outside Mosul.The second officer, a commander with the Counterterrorism Service, said the higher tempo of strikes became noticeable in late February, when the operation to expel Islamic State from western Mosul was launched.\\u201cThe coordination with this American administration has been better,\\u201d the officer said.U.S. Army Col. \\n      Joseph Scrocca, \\n       a coalition spokesman, said there had been \\u201cno recent changes\\u201d in operational procedures for approving airstrikes.He said by email that in December, as Iraqi forces fought to liberate eastern Mosul from Islamic State, the coalition \\u201cdelegated approval authority for certain strikes to battlefield commanders to provide better responsiveness to the Iraqi Security Forces when and where they needed it on the battlefield.\\u201dHe added that \\u201call strikes were still subject to the same due diligence and had to be approved by both a Coalition commander and an Iraqi commander.\\u201dAn Iraqi officer directly involved in the coordination of airstrikes said while the pace of strikes has quickened, there is still priority given to minimizing risk to civilians.\\u201cAny military operation in the world in this type of environment, there\\u2019s going to be casualties,\\u201d the officer said. \\u201cWith this type of enemy, that risk goes up dramatically.\\u201dIraq\\u2019s military denied Sunday an airstrike caused the carnage in Mosul al-Jadeeda. In a statement, it said there had been one airstrike requested by Iraqi forces that day but in a district abutting Mosul al-Jadeeda. It said Islamic State had booby trapped the houses, causing them to collapse.Militants had herded residents into basements, then used the homes as firing positions before blowing them up along with a car bomb as Iraqi forces closed in, the Iraqi military said.It said a team of experts inspected the site and found evidence of explosives in the rubble and a car bomb detonator, but no damage consistent with an airstrike.Local officials and residents have said that the area was subjected to several days of airstrikes and shelling before the deadly collapse.\\u2014Ghassan Adnan in Baghdad contributed to this article.Write to Tamer El-Ghobashy at tamer.el-ghobashy@wsj.comAppeared in the Mar. 27, 2017, print edition as 'Iraq Military Blames Islamic State for Civilian Deaths.'\", \"article_id\": 349638}"
