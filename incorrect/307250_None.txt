"{\"title\": \"Joan Baez Endorses Bernie Sanders: 'He Has Won My Heart'\", \"content\": \"\\u201cBernie has won my heart,\\u201d Baez, 75, wrote. \\u201cI joyfully and wholeheartedly endorse Bernie Sanders to be the nominee for the Democratic Party in the 2016 Presidential Election.\\u201dShe explained that this is the second time she has endorsed a presidential candidate; the first time, she publicly backed the \\u201cmaster of the spoken word,\\u201d Barack Obama. Baez said that \\u201cas a daughter of Quakers I pledged my allegiance not to a flag or a nation state but to humankind, the two often having little to do with each other.\\u201dShe said a great incentive for her decision to endorse Sanders was due to his support for causes she has been personally involved with for decades.Specifically, Baez said she agrees with Sanders\\u2019 \\u201cfirm stance against the death penalty\\u201d and found \\u201chis belief that Palestinians should have a place at the bargaining table\\u201d to be \\u201camazing!\\u201d. Additionally, Baez praised \\u201chis understanding that the prison system must transform its agenda from punishment to rehabilitation, his desire to treat immigrants as human beings, and of course by his grass roots funding and astonishing refusal to sell himself to the devil on Wall Street, or anywhere else for that matter.\\u201d She added, \\u201cI am profoundly moved by this elder statesman, his compelling honesty, and his ability to engage young people.\\u201dSanders has garnered the grassroots supports of many millennials. A recent\\u00a0survey conducted by Rock the Vote and USA Today\\u00a0found that\\u00a0Sanders is favored by 46 percent\\u00a0of voters between the ages of 18 and 34, whereas Hillary Clinton is preferred by 35 percent of voters in that same age group.\\u201cI\\u2019ve learned a lot while writing this piece,\\u201d Baez said. \\u201cI know that I am ambivalent about supporting someone who will be thrown to the lions if he wins. He is a lion in his own right, and I want to see him win. Not just to conquer the growing evil in the other party, but also to see what he can do to bend the system towards a less corrupt and more generous country than we are at present.\\u201d\\u00a0Baez\\u2019s entire endorsement can be found here.Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter\\u00a0@AdelleNaz.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 307250}"
