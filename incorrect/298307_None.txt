"{\"title\": \"Chip Kelly Fired for One Simple Reason\", \"content\": \"These two highly successful college coaches failed in the NFL for one main reason: they couldn\\u2019t find a franchise quarterback. The Eagles fired Kelly on Tuesday just short of finishing his third season.During his tenure with the Eagles, he test drove myriad quarterbacks, including Mike Vick, Nick Foles, Sam Bradford, and Mark Sanchez. He couldn\\u2019t find a true answer.The NFL is a quarterback-driven league. There is no way around it. If you don\\u2019t have a special quarterback, it\\u2019s hard to be successful. You can\\u2019t hide the position.New England\\u2019s Bill Belichick is considered one of the greatest coaches in NFL history. How successful would he have been with the Patriots if he didn\\u2019t stumble upon the second coming of Joe Montana in the sixth round of the draft? Without Tom Brady in New England, do you think Belichick wins four Super Bowls (XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, and XLIX)? Very unlikely.Belichick coached the Cleveland Browns from 1991-95, and ended up getting fired. One big reason? He couldn\\u2019t find a quarterback.In college, you don\\u2019t need a great quarterback. Most college defensive backfields are awful, so the coach can dial up wide open first-read throws with regularity. It\\u2019s easy pickings, taking candy from a baby, pick your cliche.In the NFL, pass defenses are much better, the throwing windows much smaller, and defenses way more complex. Pro quarterbacks need to be adept at reading defenses, going through progressive scans, and fitting passes into tight windows. Unlike college, the first-read often isn\\u2019t open. You need a special quarterback to handle sports\\u2019 version of a Rubik\\u2019s Cube. Playing QB in the NFL might be the most difficult job in sports.And if a coach can\\u2019t find a player who can do it on a high level, he will eventually get fired. Chip Kelly can attest to that.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 298307}"
