"{\"content\": \"SOS is the same Navy SEALS group that had its meme pulled down off Facebook last weekend. That meme highlighted the way Obama relied on the SEALS when it was convenient for him (when it came to killing Osama bin Laden), but he ignored their calls for backup when it wasn\\u2019t (when the Benghazi consulate was being overrun).\\u00a0With the release of a demand for an investigation today, SOS is upping the ante. The group of Special Ops is going so far as to suggest Obama\\u2019s actions \\u2014\\u00a0and inactions \\u2014\\u00a0in Benghazi may constitute \\u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\\u201d and thus merit the pursuit of charges from the Congress of the United States.Brigadier General Joe Stringham, USA (ret.), Special Forces/Ranger and Chairman of the Special Operations Speaks PAC put it thus:\\u00a0It remains uncertain if the tragedy in Benghazi was caused or compounded by Obama\\u2019s reckless inaction, gross negligence, or incompetent leadership. What is clear is that the deaths of Ambassador Stevens, Sean Smith, and Former Navy SEALS Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty are on Obama\\u2019s bloody hands.\\u00a0Dick Brauer, Col. USAF (ret.) Air Commando adds:The president and his administration told outrageous lie after outrageous lie to the American people and at the United Nations for weeks after the 9-11-12 attacks. He will never again be trusted to speak the truth. That is why it is essential to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate the scope of Obama and his administration\\u2019s culpability and total incompetence if not complicity with regard to [the] grave losses [in Benghazi].The SOS demand for a special prosecutor and investigation into Obama and his administration\\u2019s culpability and negligence is signed by Jim Hobson, MG, USAF (ret.) Air Commando, Joe Stringham, BG, USA (ret.) Special Forces/Ranger, Larry Bailey, Capt. USN (ret.) SEAL, Dick Brauer, Col. USAF (ret.) Air Commando, Tom Bradley, Col. USAF (ret.)

Fighter Pilot, and twenty-eight other retired officers and special forces operators.The push for an investigation is also signed by a number active duty military officers.\\u00a0Benghazi was a preventable tragedy magnified by the loss of American lives and the cover-up that has followed. SOS now seeks justice for their fallen brothers in arms.\\u00a0Their call for an investigation and a petition related to the same is available here.\", \"article_id\": 258026, \"title\": \"Special Ops PAC Demands Criminal Investigation of WH on Benghazi\", \"source_id\": 2}"
