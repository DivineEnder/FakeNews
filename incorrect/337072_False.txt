It was from the Pakistani Army, not from Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan\\u2019s spy agency. And also because of an editing error, the article misstated the number of aides to Mr. Shukrijumah who were killed. One was killed, not five. The article also referred incorrectly to five Saudis at the compound at the time of the raid. They were captured, not killed, and the army described them only as of Saudi origin; it did not say they were men, and it is not known if they were. These errors were corrected online on Dec. 7, but editors failed to follow through with this correction.\\\",\\u2022,\\\"TheMonterrey Journal articleon Thursday, about a satirical bus tour in Monterrey, Mexico, organized by a group of activists called Via Ciudadana that visits places associated with corruption, misstated the given name of a member of Via Ciudadana in some editions.

The photograph was of Ted Washington of the New England Patriots celebrating New England\\u2019s victory in the A.F.C. championship game in 2004 to advance to the Super Bowl; it did not show the Patriots\\u2019 Mike Vrabel catching a touchdown pass in the team\\u2019s victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl in 2005.
