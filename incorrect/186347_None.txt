"{\"title\": \"It's All About Race: 'Huck and Jim' Sculpture Rejected\", \"content\": \"In a whimpering column for vulture.com, Jerry Saltz, an art critic who writes for New York Magazine,\\u00a0says the new Whitney Museum of American Art \\u201cwill be marked by an invisible original sin that can\\u2019t be lifted. That sin? An aesthetic one that perfectly mirrors America\\u2019s hysteria and mania around race \\u2026\\u201dWhat piece of art catalyzed Saltz\\u2019s own hysteria? A sculpture the Whitney commissioned from American artist Charles Ray, then later declined to display: the sculpture of two figures, titled Huck and Jim, is designed to represent the Huck and Jim from Mark Twain\\u2019s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.Although the Whitney simply stated the reason for its rejection of the work was that it would \\u201coffend non-museum going visitors,\\u201d Saltz, dissatisfied and resorting to leftist race memes, insists that the real reason stems from the museum\\u2019s own racial inadequacies.\\u00a0He wrote, \\u201cThe proposed work, since made and exhibited in Chicago\\u2019s Art Institute, is not only a 21st-century sculptural masterpiece, it embodies so much of America\\u2019s past and current struggles that had it been placed in the front of this museum at this time, it might have been a beacon, a lightning rod, a second Statue of Liberty.\\u201dBoth figures are naked, as Huck admits in the book that they were often naked, although what Huck meant by naked is open to question. Jim, who is black, is nine feet tall, behind Huck, who is bent over in front of him.Saltz references the book, stating, \\u201cAs told by Twain, Huck is escaping but looking for adventure and fun. He\\u2019s no angel. All during the book, we read of how he wrestles with his conscience, thinking that the legally and morally right thing to do is to return this piece of property to its rightful owner. By the story\\u2019s end, Huck deigns to let Jim go because, as he puts it, \\u201cI knowed he was white inside.\\u2019 Thus, Huck is the hero of the book, Jim the cause of his heroism and redemption.\\u201dWell, we can\\u2019t have that, can we? Of course not. Saltz is delighted at the supposed twist Ray created: \\u201cThis is not Huck\\u2019s story any longer. It is Jim\\u2019s. Or whatever version of Jim\\u2019s story could be truly authored by a white sculptor.\\u201dYup, those whites certainly have no right to comment on the black experience.How should Huck be seen? Like this: \\u201cIn this geography of the damned, Huck is the Pontius Pilate; someone who \\u2018washes his hands\\u2019 of someone else\\u2019s fate even as this tragic act binds his fate to that of the other.\\u201dAs art critics must, Saltz focuses on genitalia: \\u201cAnd then there is the second kind of in-betweenness at work. The standing man is black; the stooping boy is white; the man\\u2019s genitals are large and uncircumcised; the boy\\u2019s penis is small and without pubic hair.\\u201dSegueing, \\u201cSexual racial tension is old in America, and deep,\\u201d Saltz quotes a 1948 essay which refers to the \\u201cshackling clich\\u00e9\\u201d of \\u201cthe white man\\u2019s sexual envy of the Negro male\\u201d and the underlying fear, \\u201cwhite America\\u2019s nightmare that someday \\u2026 he will be rejected.\\u201dSaltz concludes, \\u201cOther than the operatic scale, there\\u2019s no romanticizing of subject, no nostalgia, sentimentalizing, myth, or fantasy. No pallative parable or moral. Just the bare facts. This is a glyph for the complexities of reality. Twain\\u2019s tale was set in 1853; Ray\\u2019s story is set in an eternal present and is nonfiction. Here, in Wallace Stevens\\u2019s words, it\\u2019s \\u2018a constant cry against an old order.\\u2019\\u201dSaltz may have certain feelings of inadequacy and guilt that cause him to focus on race, but he might want to consider that the sculpture may offend people for other reasons. But to the race-obsessed left, nothing but a racial explanation will do.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 186347}"
