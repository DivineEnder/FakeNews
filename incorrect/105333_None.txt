"{\"article_id\": 105333, \"title\": \"Immelt, Donohue: Make deal now\", \"content\": \"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\\u2019s president and the White House\\u2019s top business ally dialed up the pressure on President Barack Obama and Congress Monday to immediately make a deal on the government\\u2019s debt limit ceiling \\u2013 or risk triggering more economic headaches.As Obama and leaders on Capital Hill continued to wrestle with the issue, chamber president Tom Donohue and Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric, said uncertainty about the nation\\u2019s finances are key factors in the stalled economic recovery, 9 percent unemployment and the lackluster June jobs report.Appearing at a jobs summit hosted by the chamber, Immelt and Donohue both said the lack of a deal has heightened an already uncertain climate for the business community, making Fortune 500 companies and small businesses alike reluctant to hire.\\u201cWe\\u2019ve got a very few days to fix this debt, or we\\u2019re going to be running around with very serious problems,\\u201d said Donohue during a wide-ranging question and answer session with reporters. While he expects Congress and the White House will strike a deal, Donohue said, politics on both sides are to blame for the current standoff.Immelt, who chairs Obama\\u2019s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, said an agreement would go a long way toward calming the rough economic waters and getting the anemic recovery moving again.\\u201cWe need certainty about the debt ceiling and we need it now,\\u201d he said, pointing to complaints about intransigence each side has made about the other. \\u201cThe sooner we can do it, that takes that much of a load off\\u201d and gives breathing room to small businesses who \\u201cwake up every morning in a sea of uncertainty. That\\u2019s what has to change.\\u201dThe remarks by Donohue and Immelt came just hours after Obama told reporters he\\u2019s committed to breaking the impasse. Going public with arguments he\\u2019s been making to Republicans behind closed doors, the president said he\\u2019s willing to take flak from his own party and cut programs Democrats cherish to get a deal, and the GOP should follow suit and agree to proposed revenue increases.In dual afternoon speeches before the Chamber of Commerce, Immelt and Donohue both underscored the need for government and business to create jobs by any means necessary. Donahue said entrepreneurship is the key, while Immelt said businesses must stop hoarding their cash reserves and invest. Both said government must do its part and eliminate unnecessary and burdensome federal regulations.Speaking with reporters afterward, both chided lawmakers, describing the failure to agree on a deal to raise the debt ceiling \\u2013 and tackle long-term deficit reduction at the same time \\u2013 as the primary cause of high anxiety and low hiring rates on the part of business.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled the name of Chamber President Tom Donohue.CORRECTION:  Corrected by: Burgess Everett @ 07/11/2011 10:09 PM\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled the name of Chamber President Tom Donohue.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
