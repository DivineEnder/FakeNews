"{\"article_id\": 284630, \"content\": \"Now here is an excellent piece on the trials  of communist butchers in Cambodia who killed 1.5 million in that small country.   This article  needs to be read in full. A few choice excerpts:\\u201cNazism\\u2019s trial took place in Nuremberg beginning in late 1945, and Japanese fascism\\u2019s in Tokyo the following year. But until now, we have had no trial for Communism, though real Communism killed or mutilated more victims than Nazism and Fascism combined. Communism\\u2019s trial has never taken place, outside the intellectual sphere, for two reasons. First, Communism enjoys a kind of ideological immunity because it claims to be on the side of progress. Second, Communists remain in power in Beijing, Pyongyang, Hanoi, and Havana. And in areas where they\\u2019ve lost power\\u2013as in the former Soviet Union\\u2013the Communists arranged their own immunity by converting themselves into social democrats, businessmen, or nationalist leaders.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat the Khmer Rouge brought to Cambodia was in fact real Communism. There was no radical distinction, either conceptually or concretely, between the rule of the Khmer Rouge and that of Stalinism, Maoism, Castroism, or the North Korean regime. All Communist regimes follow strangely similar trajectories, barely colored by local traditions. In every case, these regimes seek to make a blank slate of the past and to forge a new humanity. In every case, the \\u201crich,\\u201d intellectuals, and skeptics wind up exterminated. The Khmer Rouge rounded up urban and rural populations in agricultural communities based on precedents both Russian (the Kolkhozy) and Chinese (the popular communes), and they acted for the same ideological reasons and with the same result: famine. There is no such thing as real Communism without massacre, torture, concentration camps, gulags, or laogai.\\u201d\", \"title\": \"'Communism's Nuremberg'\", \"source_id\": 2}"
