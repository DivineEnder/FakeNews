"{\"title\": \"Here we go again\", \"source_id\": 1, \"content\": \"Here we go again. As Israelis and Palestinians resume direct peace talks, misinformed pundits and Republicans with an agenda are busy forecasting a Jewish revolt against Democrats in an upcoming election. While a Bill Kristol and Gary Bauer organization runs attack ads against Democrats who \\u201cjoined an assault on Israel\\u201d by signing a letter favoring aid to Gaza, The New York Times\\u2019 Charles Blow writes that President Barack Obama isn\\u2019t \\u201cgood for the Jews.\\u201d We\\u2019ve heard this sort of \\u201coy vey\\u201d attack and analysis before. The attacks haven\\u2019t worked in the past, and the analysis is still wrong.In 2004, a minority of vocal Republican Jews argued that President George W. Bush was such a \\u201cgood friend of Israel\\u201d that American Jews would abandon the Democrats to reelect him. John Kerry received 74 percent of the Jewish vote.In 2008, the argument moved from Republican greatness to Jewish worry over Obama\\u2019s \\u201csecret Muslim identity\\u201d and an anti-Israel vision antithetical to American Jews. The right wing spread vicious e-mail smears through Jewish inboxes everywhere and ran ads conflating Obama with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The return on investment? Obama got 78 percent of the Jewish vote \\u2014 virtually the same as Al Gore received with an Orthodox Jew on the ticket eight years earlier, when Gore and Joe Lieberman received 79 percent of the Jewish vote.Now, with midterm elections approaching, the voices proclaiming Jewish revolt are in full force. This time, they say Democrats will lose Jewish support because Obama is unduly pressuring Israel. As usual, these arguments are based on arbitrary quotes from the leaders of lobbying organizations or someone\\u2019s Aunt Esther. It ignores the actual data reflecting the opinions of rank-and-file American Jews.The starting point for separating anecdote from fact is to understand that Israel is not a voting priority for American Jews. In surveys that my firm has conducted for J Street in the 2008 and 2010 election cycles, only 8 percent to 10 percent of Jews cite Israel as one of the top two issues determining their vote. In other words, an overwhelming 90 percent of Jews don\\u2019t consider Israel as one of their top two issues.\", \"article_id\": 21352}"
