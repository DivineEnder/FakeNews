"{\"title\": \"Good News: Romney Knows the Media Out to Destroy Him\", \"content\": \"Whether the story is true or not, I don\\u2019t know, but sometime during the 2008 election, someone told me that our candidate, John McCain, said something to the effect of, \\u201cAll these relationships I\\u2019ve made in the media are really going to pay off now.\\u201d And we all saw how that worked out. A media desperate to see elected President a man with no record, no executive experience, and more shady characters in his past than can fit under a bus, put all their thumbs on the scale and eviscerated McCain and most especially his running mate, Governor Sarah Palin. Using phony fact-checkers, they killed any narrative that might hurt Obama. Using lies, they turned the huge crowds Palin amassed into a negative. Using their power to control the narrative, they turned Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayers, and Father Pfleger into smaller stories than those about Palin\\u2019s children and the books she never wanted banned. McCain, who had been beloved as a media-approved Republican while giving George W. Bush a hard time, was caught completely off guard and flat-footed. Suddenly his media pals turned his maverick quality into damning narrative about how erratic and unstable the Senator was. And after he stepped into their narrative with the suspension of his campaign, they finished him off. \\u00a0I\\u2019ve been watching all of the GOP candidates closely this year, and the top quality I\\u2019ve been looking for is someone who understands the political threat Obama\\u2019s Media Palace Guards represent and who has the wherewithal and stomach for the coming fight against them. Anyone can beat President FailureTeleprompter. It\\u2019s getting to him through the media that\\u2019s going to be brutal, and thus far I\\u2019m encouraged by what I\\u2019m seeing from our likely nominee, Mitt Romney. Yesterday\\u2019s Breitbart.com interview not only made clear that Romney completely understands how corrupt the media is, but also that he\\u2019s not afraid to point to them and call them by name. It\\u2019s one thing to know who your enemy is, it\\u2019s quite another to let them know you know. And I\\u2019m not the only one to see these remarks as something deeper than rhetoric to please the base. At Hot Air, Tina Korbe writes:It didn\\u2019t sound like a gimmick, though. It sounded as though a single week with the media in general election mode has sobered Mitt Romney into the recognition that the MSM really will do what it can to forward Barack Obama\\u2019s reelection effort and thwart Romney\\u2019s effort to unseat him.Indeed. Between the Romney campaign\\u2019s handling of the Obama-led attack on Ann Romney, their quick moves yesterday to capitalize and help push into the media the \\u201cObama ate a dog\\u201d Twitter meme, ads like this one, and a willingness to say on the record that the left-wing media will hit him at every turn \\u2014 I\\u2019m feeling good about our presumptive nominee. Romney\\u2019s hit the ground running, seems to understand the lay of the land, and knows just who his political enemies are \\u2014 declared and undeclared. He\\u2019s also polling much better than the media would\\u2019ve let us think possible. I\\u2019ve always liked our chances, but I\\u2019m feeling better by the day.\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 122427}"
