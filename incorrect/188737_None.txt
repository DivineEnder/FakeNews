"{\"title\": \"The Hollywood Revolt, Part 3: Boomer David Mamet Discovers The Secret Knowledge\", \"content\": \"Click here for Part 1 and here for Part 2.In many popular narratives of the period, it was the Baby Boomers (born 1943-1960) who \\u201cruined\\u201d the movies. Here\\u2019s the pretentious film snob summary of the death of Hollywood\\u2019s alleged second Golden Age, as popularized by Peter Biskind. The seventies were filled with bold, dark art and transgressive intellectualism. Then the greedy Baby Boomers \\u2013 like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas \\u2013 made \\u201cJaws,\\u201d \\u201cStar Wars,\\u201d \\u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark,\\u201d and \\u201cE.T.\\u201d All of a sudden Hollywood did not want to make serious, grown-up pictures. Now it was the age of blockbusters so simple that 3-year-olds can summarize them.\\n\\n[youtube EBM854BTGL0 nolink]It was the 1980s when Boomer Blockbuster filmmaking would arrive in the event pictures of Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson. We see this tendency further in the films of arch-Boomers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. For a definition of Boomer cinema just look at the output of their company Imagine Entertainment. These aren\\u2019t the New Wave-influenced pictures of Roger L. Simon\\u2019s generation.It was the Boomers who also gave us our most strident and simpleminded cinematic leftists: Spike Lee, Oliver Stone, and Michael Moore. Think about these three careers. Over the past 30 years have any of them shifted an inch in their political thinking? Of course not and neither have most Boomers who are still arguing over sex, race, and the Vietnam War as though it were still 1975.If I speak with some hostility about the Boomers\\u2019 failings and excesses it\\u2019s partially because that\\u2019s my nature as a Millennial/Gen Yer. According to William Strauss and Neil Howe\\u2019s books each generation acts as a check on the excesses of its parent generation. As young adults in the \\u201960s and \\u201970s the Baby Boomers declared war on the cultural institutions of their GI Generation parents. The GIs (born 1900-1924) are what Howe and Strauss describe as a \\u201ccivic\\u201d generation; they were driven toward creating social harmony. The Boomers (an \\u201cidealist\\u201d generation) were a check on that, fomenting greater individualism in the 1970s and culture wars in the 1990s. That our electoral maps are so split today is their fault. When the Civic GI President Ronald Reagan won in 1984 it was almost a solid red map. My generation \\u2013 also a Civic generation \\u2013 is a reaction against Baby Boomer extremes and will seek to create greater social harmony. This will become much more apparent as the younger Gen Yers in junior high and high school now start to make waves in 10 years.Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet (born 1957) has been emblematic of the divisive Boomer paradigm for his whole career. His plays and films are famous for the \\u201cMamet style\\u201d of short bursts of memorable dialogue and the mainstreaming of casual profanity.\\n\\n[youtube QgAU2RJHfvE nolink]And so in his book detailing his rightward shift away from a \\u201cBrain-Dead\\u201d Hollywood leftist, The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture, the reader finds this same mindset applied to the political essay. The need to divide the world into clear cut categories of Liberalism and Conservatism pervades the text. Mamet even capitalizes them to Emphasize the Great Importance of the Political War between Boomer Liberalism and Boomer Conservatism. Gone is Simon\\u2019s sense of skepticism in Turning Right at Hollywood and Vine.The Secret Knowledge is a collection of 39 short essays. Mamet has crafted an experience like the signature Boomer film \\u201cForrest Gump.\\u201d Life is like a box of chocolates \\u2013 and devouring the delicious morsels of Mamet\\u2019s book is an addictive treat, filled with surprises. Who cares if it\\u2019s just a political sugar rush? Most conservatives are familiar with the bibliography Mamet cribs his ideas from: Sowell, Hayek, VDH, Friedman, etc. Thus they won\\u2019t learn anything life-changing but will still enjoy the thrill of Mr. Mamet\\u2019s Wild Ride. And if that sentiment doesn\\u2019t summarize the Boomer cinema of Lucas-Spielberg-Bruckheimer-Moore-Stone then what does?The endowment of the Baby Boomer Hollywood Apostates is the call to fight, the drive to confront with big special effects, and the need to divide ourselves from the intolerable. This makes for satisfying blockbuster popcorn films and effective (James Carville-Karl Rove style) political warfare. While there is plenty to critique in the failings of the Boomer presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush credit must be given: the Boomer political strategists were masters. Too bad they wasted their brains on winning the electoral fights while ignoring (and sometimes exacerbating) the more vital policy fights.In Part 4 of the Hollywood Revolt, we\\u2019ll see how the Gen X leader Andrew Breitbart is reinventing this confrontational spirit \\u2013 what he calls Righteous Indignation \\u2014 and redirecting it in a more pragmatic, effective way than the Boomers ever could.\"}"
