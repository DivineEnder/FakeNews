She looks like a man\\u201d claimed Milo. \\u201cI am entitled to say I think a celebrity looks weird.\\u201d\\u201cYou think that\\u2019s fair comment and a decent thing, a civil thing to do?\\u201d Moran asked, still in awe at Milo\\u2019s answers.\\u201cOf course it\\u2019s fair comment. That\\u2019s like the definition of fair comment\\u201d replied Milo. \\u201cMay not be the civil thing to do, but if you don\\u2019t like it, don\\u2019t follow me on Twitter\\u201d.Upon being asked about his views on \\u201cbody positivity\\u201d, Milo then set the ironsights on plus-size celebrity and \\u201ccomedian\\u201d Amy Schumer.\\u201cIt is insisted upon us that we all pay obeisance to the cult of Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer that are put on the cover of magazines, and we\\u2019re all expected to pretend that we like them\\u201d declared\\u00a0Milo. \\u201cWell, we don\\u2019t.\\u201dWhen Moran suggested that he enjoyed Amy Schumer\\u2019s comedy, Milo displayed a look of horror and disgust.\\u201cNobody likes her\\u201d he replied.Moran continued with his praise of Schumer, leading to further disparagement from Milo.\\u201cOh, please. Oh god\\u2026 Then you must have very low standards for comedy\\u201d Milo\\u00a0interrupted.\\u201cNot very much makes me laugh with Amy Schumer. These are terrible, talentless people that we are instructed we must like, and the sort of sub-text is that if you don\\u2019t like them you\\u2019re some kind of bigot somehow.\\u201dYou can watch the full segment here.Charlie Nash is a reporter\\u00a0for\\u00a0Breitbart Tech.
