Foye ordered the reversal of the mysterious lane closings near the George Washington Bridge in September 2013, Bill Baroni appeared in his office, visibly on edge.\\\",\\\"Mr. Baroni, Gov.Chris Christie\\u2019s top appointee at thePort Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge, beseeched Mr. Foye, the agency\\u2019s executive director, to reclose the lanes. He kept pressing even after Mr. Foye reminded him that ambulances had been caught in the gridlock caused by the lane closings \\u2014 that \\u201csomeone could have died.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cHe said the issue was important to Trenton,\\u201d Mr. Foye recalled on Wednesday during testimony in United States District Court. \\u201cI took that to be the governor\\u2019s office.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Later that morning, Mr. Baroni went once more to Mr. Foye\\u2019s office and again asked him to close the lanes. \\u201cHe said it was important to Trenton, and he said Trenton would or might call,\\u201d said Mr. Foye, who was appointed to his job by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York. \\u201cI took it to mean that the governor of New Jersey would call the governor of New York. I said they should call.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, a Republican, are on trial on charges that they closed access lanes to the bridge and covered up their actions in what federal prosecutors say was a scheme to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, N.J., for failing to endorse Mr. Christie for re-election.\\\",\\\"During their cross-examination of Mr. Foye and the mayor on Wednesday, lawyers for the defendants tried to steer blame above and away from their clients, portraying them as well-meaning pawns in a political game they could not control.\\\",\\\"Even under questioning from federal prosecutors, much of the attention centered on the power of Trenton and Mr. Christie\\u2019s office.\\\",\\\"The mayor, Mark Sokolich, admitted that he had lied two months after the lane closings in a letter to The Star-Ledger, New Jersey\\u2019s largest newspaper, in which he said it was \\u201csimply not true\\u201d that he believed they had been motivated by political retribution.\\\",\\\"One prosecutor, Vikas Khanna, asked Mr. Sokolich why he lied. \\u201cI was petrified,\\u201d the mayor said. \\u201cI was petrified of further retribution.\\u201d The lane closings, which started on the first day of school and continued for four days, had locked emergency workers, commuters and schoolchildren in traffic for hours. Mr. Sokolich was concerned about the fate of a critical real estate development near the bridge. \\u201cWe had permits pending in Trenton,\\u201d the mayor said. \\u201cAll we needed was further retribution to bring that project to a standstill.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t know what things could happen,\\u201d he added, \\u201cand I certainly didn\\u2019t want to find out.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Lawyers for Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly tried to poke holes in the testimony of Mr. Sokolich and Mr. Foye by getting both to admit that they had lied in public statements in the weeks after the lane closings.\\\",\\\"They painted Mr. Foye as a warrior in the political battle between the two states that control the Port Authority. Mr. Baroni\\u2019s lawyer, Michael Baldassare, accused Mr. Foye of trying to stir reporters\\u2019 interest in the story \\u201cto make trouble for New Jersey.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Ms. Kelly\\u2019s lawyer, Michael Critchley, displayed an email in which Mr. Foye suggested to Scott Rechler, a real estate developer and one of six commissioners representing New York on the Port Authority board, that they talk about the lane closings during an executive session at the next board meeting.\\\",\\\"Mr. Rechler wrote back: \\u201cI think we should make raising Fort Lee a game-day decision, depending how New Jersey is behaving with respect to all of our pending issues.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In their cross-examination of Mr. Sokolich, defense lawyers also sought to pick apart the mayor\\u2019s account of the lane closings, painting him as hyperbolic and dishonest. They presented a 2010 letter to Mr. Baroni from Mr. Sokolich, detailing the mayor\\u2019s dismay over the \\u201ccrippling\\u201d traffic in Fort Lee. For 20 of the previous 40 days, the mayor wrote, his borough was \\u201ccompletely gridlocked\\u201d and a \\u201chostage to traffic\\u201d \\u2014 language that seemed to mirror his testimony earlier this week.\\\",\\\"Unable to escape the obvious similarities, Mr. Sokolich admitted, \\u201cI was trying to get Mr. Baroni\\u2019s attention.\\u201d Still, he insisted that the traffic caused by the 2013 lane closings was of a different magnitude. \\u201cI should\\u2019ve used a different adjective because I didn\\u2019t realize what would happen,\\u201d Mr. Sokolich said. He soon added, \\u201cI wish I saved them for three years later.\\u201d\\\",\\\"In an attempt to further distance his client from the lane-closing decision, Mr. Baldassare also contended that it was highly unusual for Mr. Baroni to ignore Mr. Sokolich, after several years in which he had cultivated a close working relationship. Mr. Sokolich acknowledged that he still kept a photograph of the two men in his office credenza.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOn a scale from one to 10, would you agree that Mr. Baroni not calling you back ranks as a 10 for being out of character?\\u201d Mr. Baldassare asked.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI would,\\u201d Mr. Sokolich said.\\\",\\\"Mr. Baldassare juxtaposed Mr. Baroni\\u2019s response to that of Mr. Christie, who went to Fort Lee for a highly publicized apology only after the lane-closing scandal broke open in January 2014.\\\",\\\"Mr. Christie promised they would \\u201cget together\\u201d again in a couple of weeks, Mr. Sokolich recalled. The governor, he said, never followed up.\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
