"{\"title\": \"Your Obama Apologist of the Day: Chris Rock\", \"content\": \"Comedian Chris Rock usually has something funny \\u2013 and biting \\u2013 to say about everybody.Everyone except President Barack Obama, apparently.Rather than tee off on a leader presiding over a calamitous economy, or mock an administration up to its neck in crony capitalism, Rock would rather make apologies, not withering put downs.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s  a f\\u2014\\u2014 art to the first term because you\\u2019re always running for a second  term the whole time. It\\u2019s like Clinton\\u2019s first term. You can\\u2019t really  do your gangsta sh\\u2013 until your second term. \\u2026 Even Bush couldn\\u2019t really  f\\u2014 up the world until his second term. That\\u2019s when he put the hammer  down.\\u201d\\n\\nBut Rock understands a lot of the disappointment that Obama\\u2019s supporters have had thus far in his presidency.\\u201cI\\u2019m like everybody, I want more action. But I understand that he\\u2019s  trying not to piss off a lot of people. But I believe wholeheartedly if  he\\u2019s back in, he\\u2019s going to do some gangsta sh\\u2013.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 252814}"
