EDTTHE PRESIDENT:\\u00a0 Thank you.\\u00a0 (Applause.)\\u00a0 Thanks.\\u00a0 Thank you.\\u00a0 Everybody, please have a seat.AUDIENCE:\\u00a0 Good afternoon.THE PRESIDENT:\\u00a0 Ray LaHood has said that being the Secretary of Transportation is the best job he ever had in public service.\\u00a0 And that\\u2019s fitting because Ray may be the best Secretary of Transportation that the nation\\u2019s ever had.From the day that he was sworn in, Ray has fought tirelessly to rebuild America\\u2019s infrastructure \\u2014 creating good jobs that strengthen our economy and allow us to better compete in the global economy.\\u00a0 Over the past four years, thanks to Ray's leadership, we\\u2019ve built or improved more than 350,000 miles of road \\u2014 enough to circle the world more than 14 times.\\u00a0 We\\u2019ve upgraded more than 6,000 miles of rail -\\u2013 enough to go coast to coast and back.\\u00a0 We\\u2019ve repaired or replaced more than 20,000 bridges, and helped put tens of thousands of construction workers back on the job.\\u00a0 And that\\u2019s all due in no small part to Ray LaHood's leadership.So every American can thank Ray for his dedication to make our transportation system not just stronger, but also safer.\\u00a0 When it comes to his focused attention on the dangers of distracted driving, for example, it's saving lives.And on a personal note, Ray LaHood has been a good friend of mine for many years.\\u00a0 Before he served in my Cabinet, we served together in Congress.\\u00a0 He\\u2019s a Republican; I\\u2019m a Democrat.\\u00a0 These days, that sometimes keeps folks apart, but what always brought Ray and I together was a shared belief that those of us who serve in public service owe their allegiance not to party but to the people who elected them to represent them.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 43127}"
