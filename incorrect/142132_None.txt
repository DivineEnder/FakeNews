The young people in Sadad, with the help of some armed groups, were able to fight back and push IS back to where they started. They are helped by some groups coming from different parts of Syria also.\\u201dThe hundreds of Christians who have traveled to join the fight against ISIS have been joined by many Muslims and Alawites in the ranks of the Syrian army, Karim explained.He added that a couple hundred fighters from the Lebanon-based Syrian Social Nationalist Party militia, which also includes Muslims, have joined the forces fighting to keep ISIS out of the town.The Syrian/Lebanese-recognized political party is considered by Kerry Patton, a combat service disabled veteran and senior analyst for\\u00a0Wikistrat,\\u00a0as \\u201cone of the greatest movers and shakers supporting Lebanese terror.\\u201dAlthough many of the Syriac fighters traveled to Sadad from relatively nearby Damascus and various towns throughout the province of Homs, some of them come from as far as Qamishli, a town near Syria\\u2019s border with Turkey.Qamishli is located about an eight-hour drive from Sadad.\\u201cPeople from all over Syria have arrived to fight for Sadad,\\u201d a Christian fighter told Newsweek on condition of anonymity. \\u201cIt is a symbolic place for us and we will not allow it to fall again.\\u201dThe al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, conquered the town in 2013.Assad\\u2019s army recaptured Sadad a week later, but not before ISIS murdered at least 46 Syriac Christians there.Karim acknowledged that hundreds of thousands of Christians in Iraq and Syria have fled their homelands, seeking safety from the genocide they are facing at the hands of ISIS.Nevertheless, he said it is refreshing to see Syrian Christians banding together to defend their homeland at a time when Christianity in the region is in danger of becoming extinct.\\u201cIt was emotional but it was also very encouraging to see our young people determined to defend their land and stay in their homeland,\\u201d he told Newsweek. \\u201cTo see them ready to fight and to sacrifice for their land, I think that\\u2019s what\\u2019s very meaningful, that made me very proud of them.\\u201dThe ongoing ISIS offensive in the Assyrian heartlands has driven many Sadad residents away from their homes despite hundreds of fighters joining forces to protect the town.Newsweek notes that the town\\u2019s population dropped by nearly 90 percent from about 15,000 during the summer to an estimated 2,000 now.Among the individuals who have joined the Syrian army to defend Sadad are Alawites, the minority sect of Shiite Islam that Assad belongs to.Considered to be heretics by many Muslims, Alawites follow a controversial branch of the Twelver school of Shiite Islam.Lebanese Christians along the Syrian border, backed by Shiite Iran\\u2019s terror proxy Hezbollah, have taken up arms against ISIS.Assad has formed an anti-ISIS alliance with Iran and the Lebanese-based Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah.Backed by Russian airstrikes, Iran troops, Hezbollah jihadists, and the Syrian army have joined forces to launch a ground offensive to retake key areas from rebels in Syria.\"}"
