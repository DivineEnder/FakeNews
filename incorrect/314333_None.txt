"{\"content\": \"Viewed charitably, Weinstein seems to be arguing that\\u00a0a surrender would keep Congress in Republican hands, and preserve a conservatism of sorts. What he fails to understand is that Democrats are hell-bent on maximizing power, and destroying conservatism.The\\u00a0New York Times, increasingly less coy about its left-wing agenda, proclaimed last week: \\u201cDemocrats, Looking Past Mere Victory, Hope to End the Trump Movement.\\u201d Former Obama campaign manager\\u00a0David Plouffe tweeted last month: \\u201cIt is not enough to simply beat Trump. He must be destroyed thoroughly. His kind must not rise again.\\u201dThe left is determined to do what James Carville predicted, prematurely, it had already done in 2008: eliminate\\u00a0conservative opposition, and rule for generations.Some conservatives are actually rooting for a massive Hillary Clinton win, in the belief they will avoid the consequences. My friend Bret Stephens of the\\u00a0Wall Street Journal wrote in December, months\\u00a0before the first primary votes had been cast: \\u201cLet us now pledge to elect Hillary Clinton as the 45th president of the United States.\\u201d Stephens meant that somewhat facetiously, but has since reiterated that \\u201cthe only hope for a conservative restoration is a blowout Hillary Clinton victory.\\u201dThe thinking, for some, seems\\u00a0to be that Trump and his supporters are not really conservatives, and need to be purged from the party. For others, the argument\\u00a0is that Trump\\u2019s populist rhetoric and\\u00a0nationalist policies are so disruptive that they must\\u00a0be dealt a shocking defeat so that no Republican ever seeks that path to power ever again.Whatever the theory,\\u00a0conservatives who hope for a Hillary Clinton victory share the common illusion\\u00a0that they will survive\\u00a0to rebuild the GOP\\u00a0in their image.The Clinton machine will never give them that chance. She is campaigning, for example, on an explicit promise to overturn\\u00a0Citizens United, re-writing the First Amendment to silence political speech.And as the Journal\\u2018s\\u00a0Kimberly Strassel shows\\u00a0in The Intimidation Game, Democrats are itching to finish what they started in the IRS scandal \\u2014 namely, using regulations and disclosure to shut down\\u00a0conservative groups, while letting left-wing groups and unions run wild. (And Clinton\\u2019s new\\u00a0Supreme Court picks will help.)Clinton is also promising to extend President Barack Obama\\u2019s executive amnesty to millions of illegal aliens. The Democrats\\u2019 goal has never actually been \\u201cimmigration reform\\u201d; in fact, Obama\\u2019s \\u201cDream Act by Fiat\\u201d in 2012 made legal immigration much harder.Democrats simply want millions of new, loyal voters who will permanently change the country\\u2019s political landscape so that Republicans are forced to abandon conservatism, and eventually collapse as an opposition force.Appeasement fails because once you have traded away the means and the will to resist, the first surrender is never the last. We have\\u00a0seen that before \\u2014 not just during World War II, but during the 2008 election, when Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) joined his opponent and the Bush administration in backing the bank bailout.By the time McCain arrived at the first presidential debate, there were no longer any real\\u00a0economic differences worth debating: he had surrendered on government\\u2019s role in the economy.\\u00a0After that, most Republicans in Washington were only too eager to accommodate the new regime.The task of rebuilding the opposition fell to the Tea Party and its ragtag populist army, which swept the 2010 midterm elections but struggled to withstand\\u00a0the IRS or to push back against demonization by the mainstream media.Republican leaders often\\u00a0declined\\u00a0to defend the Tea Party, and failed to satisfy the public\\u2019s intense desire for an effective opposition force that could stop\\u00a0Obama and\\u00a0his relentless power grabs.\\u00a0Donald Trump rose through a crowded Republican primary field precisely because he offered that fighting spirit, which has been missing for so long.Win or lose, what is most important \\u2014 especially given the failed opposition of the last eight years \\u2014 is the battle\\u00a0itself. Because in a worst-case scenario \\u2014 if Democrats control all three branches of government \\u2014 Republicans must be in fighting shape from Day One, and Democrats must know that if they try to carry out their plans they will be resisted fiercely.Opposition is not formally entrenched in the U.S. Constitution, except through the weakened checks-and-balances in the government itself, which Democrats have gutted.To survive,\\u00a0opposition must be a habit. And it is only in the space provided by that opposition\\u00a0that conservative ideas have any hope of flourishing in a left-ruled\\u00a0America.Beltway Republicans will not\\u00a0last long\\u00a0without the populists they carelessly disdain \\u2014\\u00a0the only conservatives the left truly fears.Never surrender!Joel B.
