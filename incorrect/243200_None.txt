"{\"title\": \"Report: Iran Grants Russia Permission to Fly Shipments to Syria\", \"content\": \"MOSCOW (AP) \\u2014 Iran has granted permission for Russian planes to fly over its territory en route to Syria, Russian news agencies said Wednesday, a bypass needed after Bulgaria refused overflights amid signs of a Russian military buildup in Syria that has concerned the U.S. and NATO.The news agencies quoted Maxim Suslov, spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Tehran, as saying it has received Iranian permission for Syria-bound flights. After Bulgaria rejected Moscow\\u2019s overflight request for Sept. 1-24, a path via Iran and Iraq appeared to be the only one left, as Russia apparently sought to avoid flying over Turkey, which in 2012 grounded a Syria-bound plane carrying radar parts from Moscow.There was no immediate confirmation from Iran.The controversy over the Russian flights comes amid signs of increased Russian military presence in Syria. Moscow, which has backed Syrian President Bashar Assad throughout the nation\\u2019s 4\\u00bd-year civil war, said its military experts are in the country to train its military to use Russian weapons.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the West of creating \\u201cstrange hysteria\\u201d over Russian activities in Syria, saying that Moscow has been openly supplying weapons and sending military specialists there for a long time.\\u201cRussia has never made a secret of its military-technical cooperation with Syria,\\u201d she said, adding she could \\u201cconfirm and repeat once again that Russian military specialists are in Syria to help them master the weapons being supplied.\\u201dPresident Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have sought to cast arms supplies to Assad\\u2019s regime as part of international efforts to combat the Islamic State group and other militant organizations in Syria.Putin hasn\\u2019t ruled out a bigger role. Asked Friday if Russia could deploy its troops to Syria to help fight IS, he said \\u201cwe are looking at various options.\\u201dBy playing with the idea of joining the U.S.-led coalition fighting IS, Putin may hope to reset ties with the West, which have been shattered by the Ukrainian crisis, and also protect Moscow\\u2019s influence in Syria, where it has a navy base. But the U.S. and its allies have seen Assad as the cause of the Syrian crisis, and Washington has warned Moscow against beefing up its presence.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday for a second time in five days. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry \\u201creiterated our concern about these reports of Russia military buildup,\\u201d adding if they are true, it could lead \\u201clead to greater violence and even more instability\\u201d in Syria.Indicating a continuing rift, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Lavrov on the call emphasized Syrian government troops\\u2019 role in confronting extremist groups and the need to take consolidated action.On Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also said the alliance is concerned about reports about Russia\\u2019s increased military presence in Syria. He didn\\u2019t offer details.A U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss the issue, said the U.S. has seen the Russians fly a variety of military assets into the airfield south of the Syrian city of Latakia, including troops capable of protecting Russian forces there and modular housing units. He said it indicated that the Russians are preparing for some sort of air operations. The official said he was unaware of any evidence that Russian forces have conducted any offensive military operations in Syria.Another U.S. official briefed on the latest intelligence declined to confirm or deny whether Russian troops have participated in military operations in Syria. However, he said, U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia\\u2019s deployment of military personnel and weapons to Syria reflect growing concern about Assad\\u2019s ability to weather opposition gains \\u2014 and it suggests that Moscow may be willing to intervene directly on Assad\\u2019s behalf.Russia\\u2019s military involvement raises a number of concerns, the U.S. official said, especially because it does not appear to be coordinated with the other countries operating in the area. It is not clear what Russia intends to actually do, he said.A Lebanese politician, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said there are Russian experts and, possibly, pilots, in Syria, but no full-fledged fighting force yet.\\u201cThere are experts and there are also crews for advanced equipment,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey have no fighting forces on the ground.\\u201d\\u201cRussia is a partner in the war,\\u201d the politician added. \\u201cRussia from the beginning told several officials, including Lebanese, that defending Damascus is like defending Moscow. It will do what is needed.\\u201dHisham Jaber, a retired Lebanese army general familiar with the Syrian military, also said Russian military experts have been in Syria for a long time.\\u201cEvery time Syria gets new weapons, Russian experts come to train them (Syrians) on these weapons,\\u201d Jaber said. \\u201cBecause of current situation in Syria, these experts need protection and special forces are in Syria to protect advanced weapons and to protect the Russian experts who train Syrians. There are plans to build a military air base in the coastal town of Jable.\\u201dJaber said the Syrian coast is a \\u201cred line for the regime and the Russians,\\u201d and it\\u2019s threatened now after the fall of the northwestern town of Jisr al-Shughour earlier this year into the hands of al-Qaida fighters and their allies. Over the past weeks, militants have shelled the coastal city of Latakia. Jisr al-Shughour is only 50 kilometers (30 miles) away.\\u201cThe Russians will not allow the fall of the Syrian coast because of the naval base and the planned air base,\\u201d Jaber said.\\u201cUntil this moment, there are no Russian forces fighting on the ground,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThere are experts everywhere, who sometimes give advice in operations rooms to Syrian forces.\\u201dRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov criticized Washington for refusing to cooperate with the Syrian government in the fight against the IS.\\u201cThe basis for action of the U.S.-led anti-IS coalition is flawed, because it should at the very least involve cooperation with the countries on whose turf this battle is being fought,\\u201d he said, according to Russian news agencies. \\u201cWhen our American colleagues manage to understand that there are global problems that can\\u2019t be solved without Russia, we will be able to cooperate.\\u201d__AP National Security Writer Robert Burns, AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee and AP Intelligence Writer Ken Dilanian in Washington, Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Elena Becatoros in Athens and Karel Janicek in Prague contributed to this report.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 243200}"
