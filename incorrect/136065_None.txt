"{\"title\": \"The Pope's climate change encyclical: what it all means\", \"content\": \"The Pope is a true believer (in the climate \\u201cconsensus\\u201d)A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system. In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon.The Pope wants the rest of us to become true believers, too, whether we like it or notHumanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming.The Pope has bought into all the doomiest of the climate alarmist establishment\\u2019s doomsday predictions, including ones that are looking decidedly shaky these days like \\u201cocean acidification\\u201d and a deadly release of methane. The melting in the polar ice caps and in high altitude plains can lead to the dangerous release of methane gas, while the decomposition of frozen organic material can further increase the emission of carbon dioxide.Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain.The Pope didn\\u2019t get the memo about sea level rises being entirely normal. Nor, apparently, has he ever wondered why Al Gore owns waterfront property.A rise in the sea level, for example, can create extremely serious situations, if we consider that a quarter of the world\\u2019s population lives on the coast or nearby, and that the majority of our megacities are situated in coastal areas.The Pope \\u2013 like US Secretary of State John Kerry and others \\u2013 appears to believe that \\u2018climate change\\u2019 is worse than Al Shabaab, ISIS, Boko Haram, the Taliban or Al QaedaThere has been a tragic rise in the number of migrants seeking to flee from the growing poverty caused by environmental degradation. They are not recognized by international conventions as refugees; they bear the loss of the lives they have left behind, without enjoying any legal protection whatsoever. Sadly, there is widespread indifference to such suffering, which is even now taking place throughout our world.The Pope is an anti-capitalist Luddite with an antipathy towards economic progress and depressingly little faith in man\\u2019s achievements.But a sober look at our world shows that the degree of human intervention, often in the service of business interests and consumerism, is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful, ever more limited and grey, even as technological advances and consumer goods continue to abound limitlessly. We seem to think that we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something which we have created ourselves.The Pope is not looking for consultancy work in the oil, mining or timber industries.The earth\\u2019s resources are also being plundered because of short-sighted approaches to the economy, commerce and production.The Pope clearly has no idea of how great a stranglehold environmental compliance now holds over the productive sector of the economy.In assessing the environmental impact of any project, concern is usually shown for its effects on soil, water and air, yet few careful studies are made of its impact on biodiversity, as if the loss of species or animals and plant groups were of little importance.The Pope gets the palm oil problem \\u2013 but hasn\\u2019t quite twigged that this is a direct consequence of all the environmental nonsense he bigs up elsewhere in his encyclical.The replacement of virgin forest with plantations of trees, usually monocultures, is rarely adequately analyzed.The Pope has a t-shirt that says: \\u201cProperty is theft.\\u201dIn some places, rural and urban alike, the privatization of certain spaces has restricted people\\u2019s access to places of particular beautyThe Pope may be a lefty but he is not a Malthusian\\nTo blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues.The Pope doesn\\u2019t want to come across as too unreasonable, thoughAt one extreme, we find those who doggedly uphold the myth of progress and tell us that ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without any need for ethical considerations or deep change. At the other extreme are those who view men and women and all their interventions as no more than a threat, jeopardizing the global ecosystem, and consequently the presence of human beings on the planet should be reduced and all forms of intervention prohibited. Viable future scenarios will have to be generated between these extremes, since there is no one path to a solution.\\nThe Pope doesn\\u2019t like the bit in Genesis which says God granted man \\u201cdominion\\u201d over earth[This] has encouraged the unbridled exploitation of nature by painting him as domineering and destructive by nature. This is not a correct interpretation of the Bible as understood by the Church. Although it is true that we Christians have at times incorrectly interpreted the Scriptures, nowadays we must forcefully reject the notion that our being created in God\\u2019s image and given dominion over the earth justifies absolute domination over other creatures. The biblical texts are to be read in their context, with an appropriate hermeneutic, recognizing that they tell us to \\u201ctill and keep\\u201d the garden of the worldThe Pope, like the Club of Rome, suspects that \\u201cThe Earth has a cancer and the cancer is Man.\\u201dModern anthropocentrism has paradoxically ended up prizing technical thought over reality, since \\u201cthe technological mind sees nature as an insensate order, as a cold body of facts, as a mere \\u2018given\\u2019, as an object of utility, as raw material to be hammered into useful shape; it views the cosmos similarly as a mere \\u2018space\\u2019 into which objects can be thrown with complete indifference\\u201d.[92] The intrinsic dignity of the world is thus compromised.The Pope has either read up on Gaia theory. Or possibly been very impressed by the shiny tree thing in Avatar.It cannot be emphasized enough how everything is interconnected.The Pope is not in the running to be the next presenter of Top GearMany cars, used by one or more people, circulate in cities, causing traffic congestion, raising the level of pollution, and consuming enormous quantities of non-renewable energy.The Pope won\\u2019t have you dissing The Day After Tomorrow or any of the Mad Max series.Doomsday predictions can no longer be met with irony or disdain. We may well be leaving to coming generations debris, desolation and filth.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 136065}"
