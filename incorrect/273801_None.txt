"{\"title\": \"ISIS Surrounds the Few Remaining Christian Villages in Syria\", \"content\": \"\\u201cWe should resist and stay; we shouldn\\u2019t leave our land,\\u201d insists Athur Ishak, a 32-year-old mother of one who divorced her husband nine years ago.Ishak is one of the few who chose to stay in Tel Tamer. She remains in her house with her nine-year-old son Ashur Francis. She is alone since \\u201cher family fled the Syrian turmoil and moved to Canada and the United States.\\u201d Half of the communities left by the end of 2014. But Ishak is not lonely as she prepares coffee for the men outside her house.\\u201cThe people who have stayed to protect the town are my new family; it\\u2019s because of them that we are still here,\\u201d she explained.In three days in February, ISIS kidnapped over 220 Christians in Syria and burned two churches. After the attack, those who chose to stay\\u00a0formed militias to fight against ISIS. The majority belong to the Assyrian Guards, but there are a few who are ordinary citizens. They are the only hope for those in Tel Tamer.\\u201cWe are surrounded from the south and west,\\u201d described Jiwan Issa, head of the town\\u2019s council.ISIS controls Tel Nasri, which is only a half-mile south of Tel Tamer. ISIS terrorists\\u00a0blew up the church of the Virgin Mary in Tel Nasri on Easter Sunday. ISIS has often destroyed\\u00a0shrines, churches, and historic sites upon conquering a territory. The civilians in Tel Tamer are calling for\\u00a0the international community to help them.\\u201cWhat we need is for you to finish them; we want them off our land,\\u201d shouted one elderly woman.Kurds live among the Christians in Tel Tamer. Issa insists the two groups live peacefully, but \\u201cnot everyone supports what could be seen as Kurdish encroachment on Christian land.\\u201d Some residents still support President Bashar al-Assad. A Christian man blamed America and Israel for ISIS. He claimed \\u201cpeople have sold themselves to ISIS for money.\\u201d But the Kurdish forces (YPG) said the Syrian army did nothing to protect the Christians in February.\\u201cWe have created a Christian military force that has become a part of the YPG, and this angers the regime,\\u201d said YPG spokesman Redur Xelil. \\u201cBut after they were attacked and the regime did not give a hand [to protect them], we believe the Assyrian and Syriac Christians will not make the mistake again to turn against the YPG.\\u201dMilitants released\\u00a0some Assyrian hostages but told them they could not return to their homes. One of them, only known as Robert, told media outlets the majority planned to move to Lebanon. ISIS also released a video of an alleged Assyrian who converted to Islam. The militants have\\u00a0not confirmed if he voluntarily converted or if the group forced him.Those persecuted under ISIS, whether they are Christians, Yazidis, or Muslims, all beg the world to come to their aid. Not much has happened, especially since the United Nations concluded the abuses \\u201cmay amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\\u201d They claim investigators thoroughly evaluated all the evidence. Yet, evidence surfacing throughout the past year proves ISIS is guilty of war crimes and genocide.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 273801}"
