The prevailing emotion:disgust.\\\",\\\"Bob Sanremoin New York: \\u201cI have no interest in Benghazi or email servers. ... There is a disconnect between Washington and 99% of Americans.\\u201d\\\",\\\"JRin Florida: \\u201cAs a Bill Buckley conservative I\\u2019m embarrassed by the naked partisanship of these hearings. This is clearly a political cheap shot against Hillary Clinton and it may well backfire.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Keith Wheelockin New Jersey: \\u201cI find the latest hearings dishonor Ambassador Stevens and our diplomats who daily are on the front lines in dangerous places.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Gregin Seattle: \\u201cIf there were a productive and beneficial purpose of these hearings, it would be to learn from whatever mistakes were allegedly made in Benghazi, and to ensure that they are not made in the future. But this circus, led by Mr. Gowdy and other partisan Republicans, never had this intent even remotely in mind.\\u201d\\\",***,\\\"4.San Bernardino Suspects Left Trail of Clues, but No Clear Motive\\\",\\\"Comments Submitted: 5,155\\\",\\\"Readers sounded off about the attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., as clues about the suspects emerged. At the top of mind:Guns.\\\",\\\"NMin New York: \\u201cHow did this tragedy come to be? Because ours is a nation awash in weapons and one in which personal grievances and political disputes are expressed violently.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Listenin Washington: \\u201cNot only do we need to ban sale of all assault rifles and high capacity magazines, but we also need to raise the minimum age of gun ownership to at least 35. Our government has completely failed us.\\u201d\\\",\\\"M.in California: \\u201cThis is disturbing not just for the number of people hurt and killed, but for the way it seems to break all conventional assumptions. The perp was not a lone loser, he was employed and they were (by all accounts) happily married, with a young daughter and the support of family. ... It\\u2019s all very unsettling.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Jenin Texas: \\u201cIn the midst of the horror of 14 deaths, I keep on coming back to one thought: how could a mother abandon her 6 month old baby?\\u201d\\\",***,\\\"3.South Carolina Officer Is Charged With Murder of Walter Scott\\\",\\\"Comments Submitted: 5,325\\\",\\\"The killing of Walter L.

Seeing this type of inhumanity left me shaking and wondering how I can bring a child into our violent society, where the very public servants meant to protect us are using us instead as target practice.\\u201d\\\",\\\"police officer in oh: \\u201cNot all cops are bad. It\\u2019s just that the bad ones get the most attention and ruin the reputation for the good ones. This shouldn\\u2019t be a white black issue. It should be a bad cop issue. Doesnt matter if the cop was white or black or the victim was white, black, purple or pink. It\\u2019s wrong either way. I hate that the media makes everything a racial issue.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Rodin New Jersey: \\u201cIt should be required of all police officers to live in the communities they serve. It\\u2019s highly unlikely, but I believe it could subside the fear and prejudice \\u2018some\\u2019 officers have towards the people living in the communities they\\u2019re suppose to protect.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Nickin Edinburgh: \\u201cI\\u2019m just a university student on a soapbox, but I\\u2019d like to see Police Academies and individual Police Departments make a concerted effort at breaking down cultural and racial barriers, building stronger relationships within minority communities, and ensuring cops engage their brain\\u2014and their legs\\u2014before they engage their weapon.\\u201d\\\",\\\"2.Clerk in Kentucky Chooses Jail Over Deal on Same-Sex Marriage\\\",\\\"Comments Submitted: 6,844\\\",\\\"Kim Davis set off a firestorm on social media as well as in the comments section when she refused to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples. She went to jail. Readers of all backgroundsagreedthat it was the right course.\\\",\\\"Karenin Cleveland: \\u201cIt often seems that those that shout about the constitution being violated, have so little understanding of what it is they are decrying: \\u2018Religious Liberty\\u2019 and \\u2018Freedom of Speech,\\u2019 \\u2018Exercising her First Amendment Rights\\u2019 - these vital principles have been reduced to...slogans.

On behalf of Jesus, I am quite embarrassed for them.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Debrain New York: \\u201cIf Ms. Davis believes so strongly in liberty, she might consider her freedom to choose a job that doesn\\u2019t interfere with her ability to practice her religion.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Fr. Larry Hansenin Portland, Ore.: \\u201cCivil disobedience has a long and distinguished history in this country. Martin Luther King and others used it as a non-violent weapon in their struggle for civil rights. But it\\u2019s important to remember that Dr. King and his compatriots accepted the consequences of their actions while protesting against the unjust laws that resulted in their incarceration. If she truly believes that she is bearing witness to her beliefs, Ms. Davis should gladly go to jail.\\u201d\\\",\\\"D Clarkin California: \\u201cThe government - and this woman - needn\\u2019t and shouldn\\u2019t concern themselves with the spiritual, religious, or cultural aspects of marriage. It\\u2019s none of their business.\\u201d\\\",\\\"John Ogarin Nigeria: \\u201cShe is in jail for standing up against evil and for righteousness. She represents the silent majority of the anti-gay, and I am absolutely proud of her standing up for her convictions.
