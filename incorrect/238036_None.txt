Since that night, there have been numerous attacks on women in the same place.Hania Moheeb, an Egyptian journalist, was one of the women assaulted that night. She said: \\u201cThe message to women is, \\u2018You should stay at home, you should stop protesting, you should feel stigmatized.'\\u201d Moheeb thought she was about to be killed; when she crossed the square, men who grabbed her from a circle of women protecting her first posed as her guardians, then ripped off her clothes, violated her, then turned her over to another group of men who violated her before they dragged her to an ambulance. Moheeb said she has heard from many other women who have suffered the exact same fate. She fears by going public, her family will be targeted, and also feels that the government will do nothing to prosecute the thugs who attack women. \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 238036}"
