"{\"title\": \"World View: The Size of Iraq Catastrophe Continues to Unfold\", \"content\": \"This morning\\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\\nHere\\u2019s a collection of facts that I gleaned from the Sunday news talkshows and from some media reports:LA Times and Israel National News and Slate\\nI listened to numerous interviews on the Sunday morning news talkshows, and I felt the best one was the CNN interview with SouthCarolina Senator Lindsey Graham:\\nDONNA BASH: And, Senator, on the issue of Iraq, I knowthat you have said that you think U.S. airstrikes is the onlyanswer right now. But I want you and our viewers to look atsomething, the toll so far when it comes to Iraq, 4,424 deaths,wounded, 32,239, and then the cost of money, $770 billion.  I havegot to ask the question that I\\u2019m sure so many Americans out therewatching are going to ask. Why spend one more dollar or risk onemore life?\\nGRAHAM: Because Iraq and Syria combined are going to be thestaging area for the next 9/11 if we don\\u2019t do something about it.The people holding ground in Iraq also hold ground inSyria. Economic instability that comes from a collapsed Iraq willaffect gas prices and our economic recovery.  But the main reasonis, if ISIS is not dealt with, that\\u2019s the staging area for a newattack on the United States.  They \\u2014 the \\u2014 the predecessor \\u2013they\\u2019re the follow-on to al Qaeda in Iraq.What they will do is use the area between Baghdad, Kurdistan andSyria to operate with impunity. They have a lot of wealth. Theywill plan an attack against our country. And my biggest fear isthat they\\u2019re going to march toward Jordan.And I hope America understands that, if the king of Jordan goes,if he\\u2019s the victim of these guys, then the whole Mideast is inturmoil.BASH: And you really thinks that\\u2019s possible?GRAHAM: Yes.GLORIA BORGER: What makes \\u2014 what makes you think they have theorganization to pull something like that off?GRAHAM: What makes you think they don\\u2019t?Look what\\u2019s happened. Look what\\u2019s happened. They have basicallyoccupied a portion of Syria. They \\u2014 they took the second largestcity in Iraq. They\\u2019re going into Baghdad.My number one goal is, let us stop them from going into Baghdad,not the Iranians. If the central government in Iraq collapses \\u2013and that\\u2019s their goal \\u2014 they\\u2019re trying to get the Iraqigovernment to collapse \\u2014 the Iranians dominate the south. Theywill own all the resources in the south.These guys will operate from Baghdad to Kurdistan, all the wayinto Syria. They will consolidate economic and militarypower. They will march towards Jordan and Lebanon. And they willuse that space to attack us. If Baghdad falls, if the centralgovernment falls, a disaster awaits us of monumental proportions.BASH: Now, the question about the leadership there now, PrimeMinister Maliki, he is somebody who perhaps has not done all thethings that the U.S. should have \\u2014 wanted them to do, which is, Ithink, an understatement.GRAHAM: Yes.BASH: So is he the right man for the \\u2014 to lead Iraq right now?GRAHAM: No. Stop the march on Baghdad. Form a new government. SendPetraeus and Crocker over, somebody who knows\\u2026BORGER: How do you form a new government? It\\u2019s a democracy.GRAHAM: There are plenty of voices over there.He [al-Maliki] should resign. He\\u2019s incapable of bringing theSunnis back into the fold. Three things have happened in 2010 and\\u201911 to create this. How did we get there should be thequestion. Al Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor to ISIS, was on theirback, just about gone. Syria blows up. They get reinforcementsfrom Syria into Iraq.Maliki withdrawals from the coalition. He becomes a sectarianleader. Obama\\u2019s administration is completely hands-off, and wewithdraw troops in 2011. That\\u2019s the perfect storm.BORGER: But whose fault was that? You know, the\\u2026GRAHAM: That\\u2019s President Obama\\u2019s fault.BORGER: Why is that President Obama\\u2019s fault? Maliki didn\\u2019t want toleave a residual force there.GRAHAM: Bush \\u2014 no, that is not true. That is absolutely a lie.I was there on the ground, at the request of SecretaryClinton. Maliki, Barzani and the Sunnis were willing to accept anAmerican force. We wanted the agreement to go through parliament,which would have been a disaster.They got what they wanted. The Obama administration wanted to say:I ended the war in Iraq. I\\u2019m going to end the war in Afghanistan.This was as predictable as the sun rising in the east. I blamePresident Obama mightily for a hands-off policy when it comes toIraq.BASH: Because, I mean, we can debate this probably for a longtime, because Maliki\\u2026GRAHAM: Look forward.BASH: OK. So, looking forward, Iran, Bloomberg News had aninteresting op-ed today, saying that they are sort of thefrenemies of the U.S. right now in Iraq. And people might notrealize this, that Iran, who is generally no friend of the U.S.,is now potentially working \\u2014 going to work with the U.S. on Iraq\\u2026. How \\u2014 does that make you feel comfortable or comfortable?GRAHAM: No. Hell no, it doesn\\u2019t.Why did we deal with Stalin? Because he was not as bad asHitler. The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdaddoesn\\u2019t fall. We need to coordinate with the Iranians. And theTurks need to get in the game and get the Sunni Arabs back intothe game, form a new government without Maliki.But, yes, I don\\u2019t want Iran to dominate Iraq. And that\\u2019s wherethey\\u2019re headed. If the central government falls, the Iranians aregoing on the Shia area of \\u2014 of Iraq, the south. Don\\u2019t theIranians save Baghdad. Let us save Baghdad, so there will be achance at a second government.BORGER: Do you \\u2014 is it your prediction that, eventually, thisWhite House will go for airstrikes?GRAHAM: I think they have to.  And it\\u2019s stunning to me that nobodyin Congress is saying, you have got to come to us first. Everybodyin Congress is scared to death of what\\u2019s going to happen inIraq. They won\\u2019t come out and admit it. But nobody is saying,Mr. President, don\\u2019t use airpower. The air force in Iraq, I think,has been grounded. But Nic will know that better than Ido.CNNA U.S. Congressional delegation is in Nigeria to discuss the terroristgroup Boko Haram, which continues to abduct schoolgirls.  According toTexas congressman Steve Stockman, the U.S. is planning military actionin Nigeria:\\n\\u201cWe get briefed by the military and pending theapproval of the government of Nigeria and our government, we planto take action, but I don\\u2019t think we are going specifics thistime; it was a classified briefing. We stand ready to help and assoon as our government and Nigerian government approves, we willtake action.\\nWhat I want to say is that I think what it is right now is to workwith the Nigerian government in training of the military. I wantto emphasize again here that we have come all these miles to saythat our Congress stands ready to cooperate and the government ina manner that is appropriate and with the consent of Nigeriangovernment. And I want to emphasize the need for the VictimsRelief Fund because there is so much suffering going on by theyoung girls and the their families that have been touched by thisviolence.\\u201dWorld Stage Group (Lagos, Nigeria)Last week\\u2019s  massive terrorist attack on the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Pakistan, on Sundayhas shocked the nation, and pressured the government to order the armyto do something it\\u2019s never done before: to go in and clean out thehideouts and weapons stores in the North Waziristan Agency inPakistan\\u2019s tribal area that are making the terrorist strikes possible.\\nAccording to a Pakistan army statement:\\u201cOn the directions of the government, armed forces ofPakistan have launched a comprehensive operation against foreignand local terrorists who are hiding in sanctuaries in NorthWaziristan Agency.  The operation has been named Zarb-e-Azb. \\u2026\\nUsing North Waziristan as a base, these terrorists had waged a waragainst the state of Pakistan and had been disrupting our nationallife in all its dimensions, stunting our economic growth andcausing enormous loss of life and property. They had alsoparalyzed life within the [North Waziristan] agency and hadperpetually terrorized the entire peace loving and patriotic localpopulation.Our valiant armed forces have been tasked to eliminate theseterrorists regardless of hue and color, along with theirsanctuaries.  With the support of the entire nation, and incoordination with other state institutions and law enforcementagencies, these enemies of the state will be denied space anywhereacross the country. As always, armed forces of Pakistan will nothesitate in rendering any sacrifice for themotherland.\\u201dAn unnamed official says, \\u201cThousands of troops will participate inthis action. You can roughly say 25,000 to 30,000 troops will beinvolved in the operation.\\u201dReports indicate that many people, both civilians and militants, haveleft North Waziristan in the last few days because the army offensivewas anticipated.The prime minister Nawaz Sharif has tried everything possible to avoidthis moment, including attempted \\u201cpeace talks\\u201d with the Taliban thatcould never have succeeded.  This is a very significant change indirection for Pakistan.
