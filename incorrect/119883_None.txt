It has denied launching the attack, insisting along with its ally Russia that the attack was launched by the rebels to drag the U.S. into war.Lavrov and al-Moallem said after their talks that U.N. chemical weapons experts should complete their probe and present their findings to the U.N. Security Council.Al-Moallem said his government was ready to host the U.N. team, and insisted that Syria is ready to use all channels to convince the Americans that it wasn\\u2019t behind the attack.He added that Syria was ready for \\u201cfull cooperation with Russia to remove any pretext for aggression.\\u201dNeither minister, however, offered any evidence to back their claim of rebel involvement in the chemical attack.Lavrov said that Russia will continue to promote a peaceful settlement and may try to convene a gathering of all Syrian opposition figures to join in negotiations. He added that a U.S. attack on Syria would deal a fatal blow to peace efforts.Lavrov wouldn\\u2019t say how Russia could respond to a possible U.S. attack on Syria, saying that \\u201cwe wouldn\\u2019t like to proceed from a negative scenario and would primarily take efforts to prevent a military intervention.\\u201dPutin said that Moscow would keep providing assistance to Syria in case of U.S. attack, but he and other Russian officials have made clear that Russia has no intention of engaging in hostilities.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 119883}"
