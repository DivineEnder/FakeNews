"{\"title\": \"Columbia Mall Murders Put Media's Anti-Gun Bias on Full Display\", \"article_id\": 153074, \"content\": \"Typical of this pattern was the way MSNBC mentioned \\u201cshooting\\u201d or \\u201cshootings\\u201d eight times in the first six paragraphs of its report on the heinous mall incident. Outlets like CNN, The New York Times, and the Washington Post followed a similar pattern.We had to look to foreign news outlets \\u2013 specifically the Daily Mail \\u2013 to see that a \\u201cyoung mom\\u201d and \\u201cher fianc\\u00e9\\u201d were targeted by a \\u201cjealous \\u2018ex-boyfriend'\\u201d in a \\u201cmurder-suicide\\u201d at the mall. Turning all firearm-related murders into \\u201cshootings\\u201d is a subtle change that then increases the number of \\u201cshootings\\u201d gun control proponents can point to when they demand more gun laws. Think Progress demonstrated this when it ran a January 23rd piece claiming \\u201cone school shooting every other school day so far this year.\\u201d  To get such a high number of \\u201cshootings,\\u201d it lumps together murders in which one person was targeted and killed \\u2013 as at Purdue University on January 21st \\u2013 and incidents in which random, indiscriminate killing took place. When every murder is a mass \\u201cshooting,\\u201d the number of such incidents increase enough that Think Progress can point to \\u201cat least 7 school shootings\\u201d in 2014 alone and \\u201c28 school shootings\\u201d in 2013.Breitbart News reported on a similar slant concerning mass shootings earlier this year, after the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence\\u2019s Ladd Everett described the criteria for a \\u201cmass shooting\\u201d as any shooting in which two or more people are killed. With criteria like this, \\u201cshootings\\u201d and \\u201cmass shootings\\u201d are sure to be reported more frequently and accompanied by calls for more gun control.Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
