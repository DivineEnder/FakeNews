"{\"article_id\": 228153, \"content\": \"Obama needs to keep every part of his base rapid and mobilized to turn out for him in the fall, and the anti-Israel left makes up a part of that base. These voters are attracted to organizations like Media Matters and others funded by the likes of George Soros. And singling out Adelson \\u2014 by painting him stereotypically as a wealthy, nefarious, shady, behind-the-scenes puppet master \\u2014 serves as a dog whistle to keep these groups engaged.\\u00a0In its most recent fundraising e-mail, the Obama campaign again targets Adelson. In the email, the campaign writes its supporters supporters that \\u201cif we don\\u2019t step it up, we\\u2019re in trouble because we\\u2019re up against billionaires and super PACs that are funneling unprecedented amounts of money to defeat Obama in this election.\\u201dThese words are followed by a graphic in which 188,679 grassroots donors making an average contribution of $53 are made equal to Sheldon Adelson.\\u201c188,679 = ONE SHELDON ADELSON,\\u201d reads the graphic. Under the \\u201c188,679\\u201d are dozens of figures representing grassroots donors. In Adelson\\u2019s column is one tuxedo-clad figure in red that is elongated to take up the whole column.\\u00a0There is a coordinated effort on the left to also make Adelson\\u2019s life miserable for donating to Republican causes. The Justice Department is investigating whether Adelson\\u2019s casinos potentially broke the law by not reporting allegedly laundered monies that were transferred to its casinos. Of course, just investigating the matter \\u2014 and making it known to the public \\u2014 associates Adelson with guilt when no monies may have been laundered at all.\\u00a0Recently, the DCCC falsely accused him of being\\u00a0\\u00a0linked \\u00a0to \\u201cChinese prostitution money,\\u201d comments which they later retracted and for which they apologized.\\u00a0And the vile and decrepit leftist comedian Sarah Silverman performed a sex act with a dog in a video in order to humiliate Adelson.\\u00a0By constantly putting Adelson in the spotlight, the left is not-so-subtly dog-whistling to its anti-Israel left to keep them engaged in a campaign in which Obama will need every part of his coalition to turn out to the polls on these secondary issues because Obama cannot run on his economic record.\\u00a0\", \"title\": \"Attacking Sheldon Adelson: Obama's Dog Whistle to Anti-Israel Left\", \"source_id\": 2}"
