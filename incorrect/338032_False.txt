"{\"title\": \"Obama Discusses Ferguson With Jimmy Kimmel\", \"content\": \"{\\\"LOS ANGELES \\u2014President Obamaon Thursday said that whoever shot at police officers in Ferguson, Mo., this week were \\u201ccriminals\\u201d and should be arrested, but added that their actions should not detract from the civil rights issues that have been raised.\\\",\\\"He said that protesters there had a legitimate right to be angry about their treatment at the hands of the police.\\\",\\\"\\u201cWhat had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest,\\u201d Mr. Obama said during an appearance on ABC\\u2019s \\u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\\u201d \\u201cBut there was no excuse for criminal acts.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama cited the recent Justice Department report on Ferguson, which he said found a \\u201cwhole structure\\u201d that indicated \\u201cboth racism and just a disregard for what law enforcement is supposed to do.\\u201d But he repeated his belief that what happened in the Missouri city was \\u201cnot unique, but it\\u2019s also not the norm.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The president\\u2019s comments about Ferguson came at a serious moment in an appearance on the late-night comedy show that also included references to Area 51, Hillary Rodham Clinton\\u2019s email address and the question of whether Mr. Obama goes in search of late-night White House sandwiches in his underwear. (\\u201cI could. I don\\u2019t,\\u201d he said.)\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama helped Mr. Kimmel open the show by participating in a regular feature in which celebrities read mean Twitter posts that people have written about them. One of the posts said, \\u201cIs there any way we could fly Obama to some golf course halfway around the world and just leave him there?\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama grinned broadly when he read that one, and added, \\u201cI think that\\u2019s a great idea.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Another post he read said: \\u201cHow do you make Obama\\u2019s eyes light up? Shine a flashlight in his ears.\\u201d After another post ended with \\u201cHaHa! LOL,\\u201d Mr. Obama tried to channel his inner teenager, saying: \\u201cThe LOL is redundant when you had the HaHa.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Kimmel introduced Mr. Obama as \\u201cthe first Kenyan-born, Muslim socialist to be elected president,\\u201d and he prodded him for details about his life inside the iron gates of the White House residence.\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama acknowledged that he had not cooked in a long time, and joked that he could not drive as president because \\u201cin Kenya we drive on the other side of the street.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Dental problems require only a trip to the White House basement, where Mr. Obama said there was a dentist chair set up. He said he had staff members reset the clocks for daylight saving time, though he declined Mr. Kimmel\\u2019s request to get rid of the time change altogether.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis is a California thing,\\u201d the president said. \\u201cIn the East Coast, you don\\u2019t mind losing that hour because that\\u2019s a signal that spring is here.\\u201d\\\",\\\"He also declined to say whether he had spent the early part of his presidency digging through the files on Area 51, the military base in Nevada that has long been a source of conspiracy theories about U.F.O.s, for evidence of extraterrestrial life.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI can\\u2019t reveal anything,\\u201d he said. When Mr. Kimmel told him that Bill Clinton had found nothing in the files, Mr. Obama added, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what we\\u2019re instructed to say.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. Obama briefly turned serious again when he used a question about campaign fund-raising to urge people to turn out to vote. And he briefly mentioned his\\u201cStudent Aid Bill of Rights\\u201dthat he announced this week to help students pay back their college loans.\\\",\\\"But most of the appearance was a comedic warm-up to Mr. Kimmel\\u2019s next guest, the actor Sean Penn. Mr. Obama said that he and Mr. Penn talked in the green room before the show. Asked if he had seen Mr. Penn portray the iconic high school stoner in \\u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High,\\u201d Mr. Obama laughed.\\\",\\\"\\u201cI lived it,\\u201d Mr. Obama said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t just see it.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"article_id\": 338032}"
