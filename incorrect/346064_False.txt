"{\"content\": \"{\\\"The South Carolina legislature has passed a bill making it illegal for a woman to get anabortionat 20 weeks or more, even if she has been raped or is a victim of incest.\\\",\\\"The passage of the legislation, which is headed to Gov. Nikki R. Haley\\u2019s desk, would make South Carolina the 17th state to approve such a ban. Ms. Haley, a Republican,said in Marchshe \\u201ccan\\u2019t imagine any scenario in which I wouldn\\u2019t sign it.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The Republican-controlled chamber voted 79-29 late Tuesday to approve the measure, which would allow exceptions only if the mother\\u2019s life was in jeopardy or a doctor determined that the fetus could not survive outside the womb.\\\",\\\"Reaction to the vote was swift. Alyssa Miller, the state\\u2019s director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement that the bill was \\u201cdangerous\\u201d for women, and that it was \\u201cmade even more extreme by removing exceptions for victims of rape and incest.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cThe reality is that abortion later inpregnancyis extremely rare and often takes place in complex and difficult situations where a woman and her doctor need every medical option available,\\u201d Ms. Miller said. \\u201cThese bills are simply part of an extreme political agenda to chip away at access to safe and legal abortion.\\u201d\\\",\\\"But others praised the legislature\\u2019s vote. Representative Wendy K. Nanney, a Republican sponsor of thePain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,said in a telephone interview Wednesday that she was \\u201cthrilled that it has passed.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cIt is something we have been working on for four years,\\u201d she said, adding that exceptions for rape and incest were \\u201cnot an issue.\\u201d\\\",\\\"\\u201cMost women would not have waited\\u201d to terminate a pregnancy, Ms. Nanney said. \\u201cThat is usually done very quickly. They don\\u2019t wait until they are five or six months along.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The legislation states that no abortion may be performed if a doctor determines the post-fertilization age is 20 or more weeks. Exceptions can be made only in the case of fetal anomaly, or if an abortion is needed to avert a woman\\u2019s death or physical impairment.\\\",\\\"Governor Haley, who has five days to sign the bill, was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. She had been traveling outside the state when the bill went to vote.\\\",\\\"Most states have enacted legislationthat restricts abortion at some stage after fertilization, a New York Times analysis showed.\\\",\\\"The Guttmacher Institute, which analyzes abortion data worldwide, said in astudy last weekthat it found no significant difference in abortion rates for 2010\\u201314 between countries where abortion is legal and those where it is restricted. It said high abortion rates directly correlated to high levels of unmet contraceptive need.\\\",\\\"Before the vote in South Carolina, 16 states had laws in some form that either ban abortion at 18 weeks or at 20 weeks post-fertilization. The laws are being blocked by federal or state courts in three of those states, while in one, South Dakota, the law takes effect on July 1, according to the institute.\\\",\\\"Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the institute, said in a phone interview that there had been 322 enacted restrictions or amendments with a negative impact on abortion services and rights following a conservative shift in state legislatures in 2010.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThis is not about anything more than trying to limit women\\u2019s access to service,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt is incredibly troubling to see how these restrictions keep gaining traction across the country.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 346064, \"title\": \"South Carolina Legislature Approves Ban on Abortions at 20 Weeks\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
