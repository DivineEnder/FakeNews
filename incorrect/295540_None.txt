"{\"title\": \"UW Students Create Gloves Which Translate Sign Language into Spoken English\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Sophomores Navid Azodi and Thomas Pryor\\u00a0received the Lemelson-MIT Student Prize for their submission\\u00a0in\\u00a0the undergraduate \\u201cUse It\\u201d catergory, which recognizes tech-based inventions that improve consumer devices. \\u00a0The\\u00a0\\u201cSignAloud\\u201d gloves\\u00a0have built-in sensors which\\u00a0read the wearer\\u2019s hand positions and movements, then wirelessly transmit them to a computer. The computer then runs the information through a gesture database, using an algorithm to determine the best\\u00a0translation, which is then spoken.Azodi and Pryor \\u2014\\u00a0who are studying Business Administration and Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering, respectively \\u2014\\u00a0met as freshmen, connecting over a similar\\u00a0interest in problem solving and inventing. \\u00a0In addition, the two discovered\\u00a0a common\\u00a0history of strong leadership and research skills, as well as a shared belief in the importance of language. Looking to make a real-world impact, Pryor and Azodi, who are both bilingual, decided to help break down the language barrier for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.\\u201cWhen we were talking about things being accessible and connecting people and making that impact we found that language and communication was the piece that holds it all together,\\u201d Azodi said.\\u00a0\\u201cThe idea initially came out of our shared interest in invention and problem solving.\\u00a0But coupling it with our belief that communication is a fundamental human right, we set out to make it more accessible to a larger audience.\\u201dDetermined to better connect native ASL speakers with the rest of the world,\\u00a0while capturing the \\u201cvery difficult\\u201d intricacies of sign\\u00a0language, Azodi and Pryor\\u00a0designed SignAloud\\u00a0in the UW CoMotion MakerSpace, a community campus space with tools and equipment available to anyone who wished to tinker or invent. Pryor and Azodi made the award-winning device\\u00a0for less than $100, and plan to use their prize money to improve the prototype. \\u201cNow that we have a few extra 0\\u2019s,\\u201d said Azodi, \\u201cwe really want to invest back in the gloves and make them more ergonomic and practical to use.\\u201dWhile there are other sign language translation devices already on the market, many are bulky or awkward and difficult for daily use. Wanting the ASL community to have a practical translating device, Azodi and Pryor designed SignAloud\\u00a0to be an overall improvement on the alternatives.\\u00a0\\u201cOur gloves are lightweight, compact and worn on the hands, but ergonomic enough to use as an everyday accessory, similar to hearing aids or contact lenses,\\u201d Pryor said.Although designed with the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in mind, the gloves have potential for commercial use in other fields, such as monitoring stroke patients and enhancing dexterity in virtual reality. In addition,\\u00a0the inventors are already planning on improving the technology so that it can be used with smartphones.\", \"article_id\": 295540}"
