I\\u2019m comfortable with that.\\u201d\\u201cI\\u2019ve made a f\\u2013k-ton of money, but I\\u2019ve never made a dishonest dollar,\\u201d he said of his career. \\u201cI try to do right by the people around me.\\u201dHe closed the post offering no apologies, and stated his\\u00a0opinion of the once wildly popular musical genre \\u201cRap-Rock,\\u201d which helped catapult him to superstardom more than a decade ago:Rap-rock was what people wanted at the time, and they still love those songs at shows. But it turned into a lot of bulls**t and it turned out to be pretty gay\\u2026If someone says you can\\u2019t say \\u201cgay\\u201d like that you tell them to go f**k themselves. You\\u2019re not going to get anything politically correct out of me.Kid Rock\\u2019s 10th studio album, titled First Kiss, will be released\\u00a0on Feb. 24th.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 139788}"
