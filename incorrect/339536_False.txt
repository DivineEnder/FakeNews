"{\"article_id\": 339536, \"title\": \"Comfort Food From the Caucasus, Served Up in Brooklyn\", \"content\": \"{\\\"On a recent Friday evening in Brighton Beach, a cool breeze made its way inland from the water, andTon\\u00e9 Caf\\u00e9, New York\\u2019s oldest Georgian bakery, seemed a wrinkle in time, the stations of immigration all represented at once. A jazz band played just loud enough to drown out the conversation of a middle-aged trio of Russians at the corner table, two men and a woman with weathered faces methodically making their way through a bottle of vodka. At another table, four young men, recent immigrants from the Caucasus, argued and laughed. At a third table, two American families were enjoying the food and wine.\\\",\\\"Ton\\u00e9 Caf\\u00e9 is tucked snugly between an auto-parts shop and a Chinese takeout on Neptune Avenue, just four blocks from the Atlantic Ocean. The restaurant is named for the \\u201cton\\u00e9,\\u201d a brick oven, similar to an Indian tandoor, that bakes the luscious strips of salty bread. Nikoloz Chkheidze, 45, one of three current owners, added the sit-down area two years ago. It\\u2019s an intimate space, with parquet floors and wallpaper painted to look like stone. A window into the bakery allows diners to watch the bread being made by Lasha Janashvili, the bear-size \\u201cmain master of breadmaking,\\u201d as Mr. Chkheidze put it, who slaps the loaves against the inside of the oven where they stick and bake. The recipe, Mr. Janashvili said, came with him from Georgia. \\u201cMainly secret,\\u201d he added with a sly grin.\\\",\\\"Brighton Beach has long been known as Little Odessa for the waves of immigrants it absorbed from the Soviet Union. Catering to this community are Russian superstores, Russian radio and TV stations, and a City Council campaign boasting rival Soviet-born candidates and featuring ananonymous robocall that accused one of them of a sordid KGB past. (Another candidate, favored by the district\\u2019s large Orthodox Jewish population, eventually won.) And now, a number of Georgian bakeries are exploiting Russians\\u2019 love of Georgian food.\\\",\\\"\\u201cGeorgian food, it\\u2019s something special,\\u201d explained Mila Dubravina, 68, who is originally from St. Petersburg and lives in Bensonhurst. Ms. Dubravina had come to Ton\\u00e9 Caf\\u00e9 on a recent afternoon with two friends. It was her first time \\u2014 she had seen an advertisement for the restaurant on Russian TV, and came to revive memories of Georgia from her younger days. \\u201cGeorgians are very good people, very sympathetic, very friendly, very \\u2014 how you say \\u2014 hospitality,\\u201d she recalled fondly.\\\",\\\"Georgia sits below Russia on the Black Sea, sharing a border with Turkey and Armenia. Georgian food is to Russians what Italian food is to Americans \\u2014 the savory proceeds of a supposedly hot-blooded people respected for their ancient culture, their mastery of wine and their hospitality. \\u201cWhat is hidden from a guest belongs to the devil,\\u201d they say in Georgia. In addition to the famous bread, Georgian food is known for a sumptuous pizza-like creation called khachapuri, which oozes with hot cheese and eggs baked into the dough.\\\",\\\"On that same afternoon, a woman named Olga had come from Manhattan to eat at Ton\\u00e9 Caf\\u00e9. When asked to provide her last name, Olga, like many Soviet \\u00e9migr\\u00e9s, simply shook her head no, as if to say, \\u201cOf course not.\\u201d But she did say that she came to the United States in 1981 from Moscow, where she regularly ate Georgian food. Of New York\\u2019s Georgian offerings, she said, Ton\\u00e9\\u2019s were the best.\\\",\\\"\\u201cOur approach is to propose new taste to American markets, American community,\\u201d Mr. Chkheidze said. He has a takeout branch of Ton\\u00e9 Caf\\u00e9 in Manhattan, and hopes to expand to five or 10 more locations. \\u201cGeorgian culture is very welcoming culture,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhat you give \\u2014 it\\u2019s yours. And what you don\\u2019t give \\u2014 it\\u2019s lost.\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
