"{\"content\": \"Brazil\\u2019s federal prosecutors are already investigating\\u00a0construction projects composing a large waterfront rejuvenation known as \\u201cPort Marvel\\u201d in the host city, but prosecutor Carlos Lima says\\u00a0there are plenty more projects currently under the investigators\\u2019 magnifying glass. \\u201cThere are more\\u2026 until they are finalized we will not know how many for sure.\\u201dMost sports facilities and related tourist projects built for the Olympics are in the hands of five engineering firms, Reuters notes. All have been implicated in a massive corruption probe known in Brazil as \\u201cOperation Car Wash.\\u201d Prosecutors have found that, for years during the tenure of leftist President Luiz In\\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, dozens of politicians were lining their pockets by overcharging or accepting bribes for projects by the state-owned oil corporation Petrobras. Da Silva himself has been accused of purchasing a waterfront home with illicit Petrobras money, an allegation prosecutors are prohibited from pursuing because current president Dilma Rousseff named him her chief of staff shortly after the allegation surfaced, granting him executive immunity.Rousseff is facing impeachment for misrepresenting the state of the Brazilian economy by passing executive orders to take loans out that artificially inflated the nation\\u2019s surplus. The House of Representatives voted to impeach her Sunday by an overwhelming margin.Speaker of the House Eduardo Cunha stands\\u00a0accused of taking over $5 million in bribes through Petrobras.The prosecutor Lima is not in charge of investigating corruption related to the Rio Olympics projects because intelligence suggests sitting politicians are involved. In those cases, only the Brazilian Supreme Court may prosecute.The tumultuous political situation in Brazil has alarmed many regarding the odds of the nation executing a successful Olympic Games. The nation lost its\\u00a0Olympics\\u2019 security chief and minister of tourism\\u00a0to the ongoing impeachment scandal. Workers have stopped their operations on projects complaining that they\\u00a0are consistently getting paid late. International Olympics observers are complaining that some sports parks are suffering from routine electrical outages\\u00a0or faulty scorekeeping technology.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has routinely rejected any concern regarding\\u00a0whether the\\u00a0Olympic Games will actually happen.\\u201cThe Brazilian people will deliver a memorable Olympics, full of passion for sports which has made them famous globally,\\u201d an IOC spokesman said in March, in response to the new involvement of da Silva in the Petrobras case and growing concerns regarding the Zika virus. Last week, before the House impeachment vote, an IOC official asserted that the political turmoil was \\u201cnot creating an impact on the games.\\u201d Shortly after the vote, the IOC sounded even more optimistic.\\u00a0\\u201cThe Olympic Games will deliver an important legacy and provide an important opportunity to unite the people of Brazil no matter their background or political views,\\u201d the IOC said in a statement.Thomas Bach, the president of the IOC, said Tuesday\\u00a0he expects a \\u201cspectacular\\u201d Olympic ceremony.\\u00a0\\u201cWe know the current economic and political situation in Brazil will continue to make final preparations challenging, but I\\u2019m convinced, and we are all convinced, that the Olympic Games 2016 will be truly spectacular,\\u201d he told reporters.\\u00a0\\u201cThe Olympic Games enjoy strong public support from the Brazilian people and the organisers can count on the solidarity of the sporting world.\\u201d\", \"article_id\": 297427, \"title\": \"Brazil: Prosecutor Confirms More Olympic Projects Looped into Corruption Probe\", \"source_id\": 2}"
