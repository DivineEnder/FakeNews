DeFazio: Obama could lose\", \"content\": \"Saying there\\u2019s no \\u201cfight\\u201d in President Barack Obama, a House Democrat who returned to Oregon for the congressional summer recess said he isn\\u2019t sure the president can win a second term or even carry his very blue state.Rep. Peter DeFazio says he\\u2019s unhappy with the president\\u2019s \\u201cflip flops\\u201d in negotiations with Republicans and thinks a moderate GOP candidate could beat Obama next year.\\u201cAt this point, it pretty much depends on how far out there the Republican nominee is. You know, with a respectable someone who is a little bit toward the middle of the road Republican nominee, he\\u2019s going to have a very tough time getting reelected,\\u201d DeFazio told Portland TV station KGW.And, DeFazio said, he\\u2019s not sure Obama will do well in Oregon in 2012, even though he won nearly 57 percent of the vote there three years ago.\\u201cI believe Oregon is very much in play,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI mean, we are one of the harder hit states in the union, particularly my part of the state \\u2026 [P]eople are shaking their head and saying \\u2018I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019d vote for him again.\\u201dWhen one man asked what Obama had done for him, DeFazio said his best response was \\u201cit could have been worse.\\u201dDeFazio has taken issue with Obama\\u2019s negotiation skills in the past and did again this week.\\u201cFight? I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a word in his vocabulary,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI mean, come on \\u2014 he pledged as a candidate to make the Bush tax cuts for people making over $250,000. He repeatedly said that as president.\\u201d\\u201cThen the Republicans telegraphed to him they were going to use a fake crisis over the debt limit in order to muscle some major spending reductions or other things on to him,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd what happens? Suddenly he flip flops and concedes everything to the Republicans.\\u201dDeFazio, who endorsed Obama over Hillary Clinton late in the 2008 Democratic primary process, has been critical of Obama\\u2019s negotiation skills and the administration more broadly. On the House floor last month, DeFazio said the president was \\u201cpreparing yet another great cave\\u201d on a debt ceiling deal.But DeFazio\\u2019s latest comments come as frustration with Obama has spread in the Democratic Party as Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) showed at a town hall in Detroit this week, where she told black voters to \\u201cunleash\\u201d her and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus to confront Obama on jobs. Meanwhile, the president\\u2019s approval rating has fallen into the low- to mid-40s in most major polls, and even lower \\u2013 39 percent \\u2013 in the Gallup daily tracking poll.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
