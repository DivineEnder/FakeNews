"{\"title\": \"Clinton Plays It Frosty Between the Ferns\", \"source_id\": 22236, \"content\": \"{\\\"Yesterday, Hillary Clinton arguably had one of her most effective public appearances in months, and it happened on the website Funny or Die. Clintonappeared as a gueston \\u201cBetween Two Ferns\\u201d with Zach Galifianakis, a semi-aggressive, extremely rumpled comedian and sort-of talk show host who makes David Letterman look painfully earnest by comparison. The show has a glaringly low-rent aesthetic, like something made in an office park, circa 1981, by a bunch of interns with time on their hands. That sensibility \\u2014 self-mocking, on-the-fly and D.I.Y. \\u2014 is very 2016.\\\",\\\"Beyond looking hip to millennial humor, Clinton played an especially strong version of herself on the show. As Galifianakis comes at Clinton with a series of absurd, abrasive questions, she stares him down icily; one could imagine if she had been coached on a single stance to take throughout the interview, it would have been to inhabit the word \\u201cwithering.\\u201d A question about the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a setup for Galifianakis to tell Clinton, \\u201cYou\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u2018Yeah, you know me,\\u2019\\u201d a play on the 1991 hip-hop song \\u201cO.P.P.\\u201d by Naughty by Nature. Clinton cuts him off: \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell me what to say.\\u201d This was the purely comic, talk-show equivalent of her most successful social media moment all year, in which she, or a member of her campaign staff, responded to a tweet from Trump calling her \\u201ccrooked Hillary\\u201d following Obama\\u2019s endorsement of her. Clinton\\u2019s tweet told Donald Trump \\u2014 to thundering approval from the young and the left \\u2014 to\\u201cdelete youraccount.\\u201d\\\",\\\"The appearance on \\u201cBetween Two Ferns\\u201d was comedy, not substance, but it was in the service of her assumed total authority. The humor also evoked a successful meme that circulated widely in 2012, back in the days when Clinton was enjoying all those high approval ratings in her role as Secretary of State. The Tumblr meme, called Texts from Hillary, employed a photo of Clinton, in sunglasses, straight-faced and peering at her BlackBerry, in conjunction with photos of other people texting her. \\u201cHey girl,\\u201d the text below an image of Ryan Gosling on his own device says. Below it is Clinton, texting back: \\u201cIt\\u2019s Madam Secretary.\\u201d An image of Rachel Maddow, smiling, asking, \\u201cWho run the world?\\u201d is followed by the same unsmiling Clinton, who texts back simply, \\u201cGirls.\\u201d Like \\u201cBetween Two Ferns,\\u201d the meme uses pop culture as an opportunity for Clinton to look both of it and above it all; a feminist gloss added more heft to admire.\\\",\\\"Maybe the creators of Texts from Hillary (publicists with no official prior connection to Clinton) would have revived the meme during her campaign, were it not for the inconvenient fact that her BlackBerry has come to be associated with the most unfortunate story of Hillary\\u2019s campaign: her emails. It is a loss for Clinton, because the meme did something for her image that was not easy to pull off \\u2014 it made a 68-year-old woman look cool. We would probably cringe if this particular 68-year-old womanplayed a saxophoneon the modern-day equivalent of Arsenio Hall, or tried todance like Michelle Obama, or crooned, spontaneously,\\u201cAmazing Grace.\\u201dWhat Hillary Clinton can do, in moments like her appearance on \\u201cBetween Two Ferns,\\u201d is own her toughness, which is another way of saying, her imperviousness.\\\",\\\"Duringherspeechat the Democratic National Convention, Clinton leaned into her nature as a workhorse, not a showboat; she was going for authenticity, but that particular boast also smacked of the dreaded role of bean-counter assigned to too many women who are seen as invisible executors, not visionaries. In the BlackBerry meme, and on the show, Clinton was not pictured as the workhorse; to the contrary, she was playing the boss who\\u2019s boss. \\u201cHer biggest mistake,\\u201d a friend who supports her lamented to me recently about her campaign, \\u201cis that she is too afraid of making a mistake.\\u201d Hillary on her BlackBerry is not afraid of making a mistake; the Hillary on \\u201cBetween Two Ferns\\u201d was comically uncowable, and somehow, because of that, sort of inspiring.\\\",\\\"There is, of course, something mildly patronizing about the meme, and even about the tough-gal role Galifianakis had Clinton play on the show (much of which was apparently improvised). We will know women have achieved equality when a line like \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell me what to say\\u201d is no funnier coming from a powerful female than a powerful male. Like the Notorious R.B.G. \\u2014 another Tumblr meme, which featured images of Ruth Bader Ginsburg styled as a famous rapper, recasting her power as revolutionary and brash \\u2014 the humor comes from the unlikely contrast; it\\u2019s funny the way that putting a baby in glasses and suspenders is funny.\\\",\\\"For Clinton, figuring out how to bring that likable toughness to thedebateMonday night, in real time, will not be easy, as she\\u2019ll be walking a fine line. Maybe she will go for withering. In debates, she is often strong, her campaigning self-consciousness supplanted by an occasionally acidic, businesslike efficiency. Or maybe she\\u2019ll go for something else altogether. Clinton has often been criticized for a smile that looks devoid of real feeling. An opposite effect was on display on \\u201cBetween Two Ferns\\u201d: She often appeared as if she was trying to look serious, while suppressing a laugh. It was a good look for her \\u2014 and one she\\u2019ll probably have plenty of opportunity to try out on Monday night.\\\"}\", \"article_id\": 349165}"
