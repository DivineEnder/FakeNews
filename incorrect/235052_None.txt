"{\"title\": \"War Documentarian: Veterans Awed by Valor, Sacrifice of Millennials Fighting in Iraq\", \"content\": \"This Memorial Day Weekend on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, Breitbart News\\u00a0Editor in Chief Alexander Marlow and Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon spoke with award-winning documentary filmmaker and President of the Claremont Institute, Michael Pack, about his film\\u00a0The Last 600 Meters: The Battle for Fallujah.\\u00a0Bannon is also executive producer of this film, which\\u00a0provides a raw and realistic look at what it was like for America\\u2019s special Marine forces as they battled in Iraq.\\u201cTheir story was so compelling and not being told, so we wanted to tell it,\\u201d Pack told Breitbart News.While the majority of documentaries focus on wounded warriors coming home from places like Haditha and Abu Gharib Prison, 600 Meters\\u00a0focused on the the battle stories and what these men and woman experienced there.PBS has yet to release\\u00a0The Last 600 Meters\\u00a0due to a beheading scene, Pack said. The issue is still being disputed. Pack said the beheading was\\u00a0ncessary to give the audience an accurate sense of the enemy.\\u00a0\\u201cI\\u2019ve been making documentaries for PBS for over 30 years, and I\\u2019ve\\u00a0never faced so much resistance and so many roadblocks as I have with\\u00a0600 Meters,\\u201d\\u00a0the filmmaker\\u00a0told Marlow and Bannon\\u201cIf you take out the evil these people combated, then these people look like super aggressive, adrenaline junkies that were not motivated by anything. But they were motivated by the desire to stop evil,\\u201d He was critical that scenes of brutal violence by the Islamist enemies are not included in more\\u00a0documentaries and feature films\\u00a0on the continuing Middle East wars.The horror of several beheadings during the\\u00a0first battle of Fallujah that led the Marines to come in with massive fire power in the second battle in that region, Pack explained.The film\\u2019s title was inspired by the distance between a Marine sniper and his target\\u2013the \\u201clast 600 meters\\u201d of a global foreign policy and national security strategy.When asked about ISIS, Pack said their \\u201cpower is unimaginable.\\u201dThey have filled the vacuum that was left when President Barack Obama withdrew our troops and\\u00a0essentially \\u201cabandoned Iraq.\\u201dBannon expounded on this intensity by referring to\\u00a0a knife fight which took place between Marine veteran-turned Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton and\\u00a0one of the insurgents that is featured in the documentary. \\u201cThis war was bloody and horrific,\\u201d Bannon noted, and reiterated it\\u2019s important that at least one\\u00a0film \\u201cactually highlights the sacrifice and the combat valor of our men and women.\\u201dAt a screening of the film for\\u00a0WWII veterans, the audience expressed awe in the millennial generation bravely fighting this complex and controversial war. Pack said the vets\\u00a0approached him to say, \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe the valor of these young guys. It\\u2019s so horrific the conditions they had to fight in.\\u201dThe veterans told Pack that\\u00a0we could have won in Iraq in 2008 if we had just \\u201cput the hammer down\\u2026 But those things didn\\u2019t happen. They decided to ease off the enemy again.\\u201dPack\\u2019s films are available\\u00a0on ManiFoldproductions.com. He anticipates it will be released in its entirety in the coming months, likely on the\\u00a0PBS network.Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 235052}"
