"{\"title\": \"WaPo Reporter: 'Security Risk' With Clinton Server Over 'Very Sensitive' Material\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Washington Post\\u00a0Reporter\\u00a0Carol Leonnig, who\\u00a0broke the story\\u00a0on the FBI looking into Hillary Clinton\\u2019s email system along with\\u00a0Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger, stated that the \\u201csecurity risk\\u201d with Clinton\\u2019s private server is because \\u201cthe Secretary of State\\u2019s going to be discussing\\u2026very sensitive material we wouldn\\u2019t want falling into enemy hands\\u201d on Wednesday\\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\\u2019s \\u201cMorning Joe.\\u201dLeonnig said, \\u201cThere were a lot of concerns inside the State Department among aides, and also in the campaign, about the security of the server, largely for practical reasons. It was actually failing at times, and kind of crashing. \\u2026 So there were anxieties about that, not because they were worrying about classified information, per se, but because there were questions, \\u2018Is this really working properly?'\\u201dShe added, \\u201cit has to be said that Hillary Clinton has said, over and over again, [paraphrasing] \\u2018the material that I sent and received was never stamped classified.\\u2019 And, of course, as we all know, the intelligence community Inspector General has said, it appears that a lot of this material was classified in nature, whether it was stamped that way or not. And that\\u2019s the security risk is, the Secretary of State\\u2019s going to be discussing things like, the movements of foreign dignitaries, the private discussions with foreign governments, security at, say, embassies and consulates. And that is all going to be very sensitive material we wouldn\\u2019t want falling into enemy hands.\\u201dLeonnig later stated, \\u201cSources are concerned \\u2014 that are in the intelligence community, are concerned about, again, the possibility of hacking, the possibility of unknown access, and this material falling into the wrong hands. That\\u2019s the number one, primary concern. And there are a lot of interesting cases, David Petraeus, Sandy Berger, and [with] many of them, the legal issue is, did they willfully, knowingly release classified information and pass it on to somebody? Did they willfully take it out of secure holding or storage? In this case, really, what the \\u2014 both the IG and the FBI are trying to figure out is, is this material secure now? Has it been secure? And let\\u2019s make sure it doesn\\u2019t fall into enemy hands.\\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\", \"article_id\": 199668}"
