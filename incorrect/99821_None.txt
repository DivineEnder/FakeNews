As secretary of defense, I\\u2019m committed to removing all barriers that would prevent Americans from serving their country and from rising to the highest level of responsibility that their talents and capabilities warrant,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThese are men and women that put their lives on the line in defense of this country \\u2014 that\\u2019s what should matter most.\\u201dMullen, whose \\u201ccourageous testimony and leadership\\u201d Panetta credited for the successful repeal of the controversial policy, echoed the defense secretary\\u2019s message, saying that because of the end of \\u201cdon\\u2019t ask, don\\u2019t tell,\\u201d \\u201cwe are a stronger joint force, a more tolerant joint force, a force of more character and honor.\\u201d\\u201cToday is really about every man and woman who serves this country, every man and woman in uniform, regardless of how they define themselves,\\u201d Mullen said. \\u201cTomorrow they\\u2019ll all get up, they\\u2019ll all go to work, and they\\u2019ll all be able to do that work honestly.\\u201dPanetta and Mullen both expressed confidence that the military has taken all of the appropriate measures to ensure that the repeal of \\u201cdon\\u2019t ask, don\\u2019t tell\\u201d \\u2014 which took effect just after midnight and now allows gays and lesbians to serve openly \\u2014 would be implemented in ways consistent with the standards of military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion and the recruiting and retention of the armed forces.According to Panetta, over 97 percent of the 2.3 million men and women in uniform have now received education and training on the implementation of the repeal.Asked about how the military can guard members of the military against harassment and violence against gays, Panetta noted that the military has a \\u201czero tolerance\\u201d with regards to harassment and that military leaders must be on the lookout for potential problems that arise.When a reporter asked about Gen. James Amos\\u2019s testimony in Congress in December, in which the Marine Corps\\u2019 top general expressed concerns about the negative effect the repeal would have in the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, Mullen said that so far there have been no alarm bells.\\u201cThe training was not to change one\\u2019s views \\u2014 it was to make sure everybody understood what the rules were,\\u201d he said, adding that he had \\u201cgreat confidence\\u201d that the Marines would handle the repeal without a hitch.Panetta, who said he had spoken to Amos about the issue, said the general had told him that he was \\u201ccommitted to putting this in place and that it was now important to move on.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1}"
