City Hall has ignored the dramatically diminished staffing in the NYPD for well over a decade and now this administration is left to fix the problem. Hiring more police officers is critical to addressing this problem and it must begin immediately.\\u201dThe NYPD\\u2019s Deputy Commissioner for Public Information, Stephen Davis, said in a statement, \\u201cThis program is still in the process of being assessed as to the actual number of personnel to be temporarily assigned and the units from which they will be reassigned, as well as the areas where they may be deployed. This personnel reassignment plan is part of a broader review of patrol resource allocation during the next 90 day period. Based on this review, the actual number of personnel to be included in the Summer All Out program may be adjusted.\\\"Here is Bratton\\u2019s memo:A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York education policy and politics.A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York energy policy and politics.A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York health care policy and politics.A free, abridged version of our Pro morning email about New York health care policy and politics.A morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on state news and politics.A morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on city news and politics.A weekly round-up of legislation in City Council for politics and policy professionals.A reported briefing on money in politics, executive moves, and trends in communications, lobbying and consulting.A twice-a-week digest of news on courts and the law in New YorkAzi Paybarah and Jimmy Vielkind's must-read briefing informing the daily conversation among knowledgeable New Yorkers.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
