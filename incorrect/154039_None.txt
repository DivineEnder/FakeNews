"{\"title\": \"Matthews: Dems Must Support War to 'Save President's Hide'\", \"content\": \"I think the Democrats are going to be forced to sacrifice men and women who really, really don\\u2019t want to vote for this.

Clearly people are changing sides. Just like the Democrats who supported Lyndon Johnson after the Vietnam war, after it was over they turned on Nixon. The same exact people. So partisanship shows its ugly head here.Watch the segment here: \\u00a0\\n(h/t: Evan McMurry, Mediaite)\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 154039}"
