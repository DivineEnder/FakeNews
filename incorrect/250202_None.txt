"{\"content\": \"It\\u2019s official: David Shuster is in very bad odor at MSNBC. From Mediaite, quoting an email from Phil Griffin, Shuster\\u2019s boss, to a member of the public:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\u2019s probably it for our friend Dave, at least as far as his MSNBC career is concerned. His crime, reportedly, was taping a pilot for failing rival CNN, which would have brought him full circle on his tour through the cable-news jungles. After starting in the CNN Washington bureau, he moved on to Fox News, where he covered both the Clinton impeachment (Shuster had done some time himself in Little Rock, as a correspondent for KATV there, so he knew the territory) and the attacks of Sept. 11.But then came the fateful bargain with MSNBC \\u2014\\u2014 and a guy who had been, if memory serves, a perfectly rational and reasonable reporter turned into a screaming nut case, as in this memorable exchange with Andrew Breitbart, which as things turned out, was the beginning of the end. He took the bait that Breitbart offered, and effectively destroyed his own career:\\n\\n[youtube Or-_ARBMDC4 nolink]\\nNo good can ever come of working for MSNBC (just ask Dan Abrams, Mediaite\\u2018s boss).   The insanity of the place corrodes everyone\\u2019s mind and soul, encouraging them to spew forth their bitterness and hatred and rage in the hopes of fleeting celebrity and phantom ratings.   It\\u2019s a Faustian bargain and one that ends pretty much the same way as it did for Goethe\\u2019s tragic hero.\\nAlas, poor David.   Now, like Faust, you can say:I may not pretend, aught rightly to know,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[youtube 7TCfNFckx6Q&feature nolink]A lesson for aspiring TV newsers everywhere.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 250202, \"title\": \"David Shuster, Faust, and the Perils of Selling Your Soul\"}"
