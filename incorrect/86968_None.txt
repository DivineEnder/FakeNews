"{\"title\": \"Two sides in Goldman Sachs problem\", \"content\": \"The biggest PR headache for the powerful Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs right now is likely Greg Smith, an insider who resigned Wednesday through a New York Times op-ed article, citing the investment firm\\u2019s culture of immorality and cheating.Smith\\u2019s righteous public resignation went viral, circulating to millions of people who agreed with his basic take on the predatory nature of our modern banking system. He described a hyper-inflated version of what the banker Jonathan A. Knee wrote in \\u201cThe Accidental Investment Banker,\\u201d years ago, that Wall Street deal-making culture is one of grab money today and ignore the consequences, or IBG-YBG (\\u201cI\\u2019ll be gone, you\\u2019ll be gone\\u201d).As one person exited Goldman on Wednesday, another joined. Goldman has brought in a person well suited to address this problem: Jake Siewert, a former aide to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Siewert, a well-known Democratic press operative and PR expert, will likely use his skills to figure out the best way of tamping down the media firestorm. Good luck.Yet this dangerous combination of vacillating government policymaking and corruption within the financial industry has happened before, and America successfully addressed it then with bold and broad solutions.In the 1930s, policymakers were also loath to act \\u2014 until the high-profile Pecora Commission hearings revealed deep and widespread abuse in the banking industry. This was preceded by cultural movements such as the \\u201c Bonus Army,\\u201d a group of World War I veterans, who camped out on the Mall seeking early payment of the bonuses due them. Eventually, we succeeded in both imposing a safe regulatory structure and an ethical culture on Wall Street. Americans will have to mimic our forebears now.Meanwhile, what the Smith and Siewert episodes reveal is disturbing. The problems that Smith revealed in his op-ed were what lead to the crisis \\u2014 ones that the Dodd-Frank regulations were supposed to solve. Smith described how clients were referred to as \\u201cMuppets\\u201d and Goldman executives were \\u201cripping eyeballs out\\u201d of their clients in the derivatives division.Goldman now has access to the Federal Reserve\\u2019s discount window as a result of the financial bailouts \\u2014 which means taxpayers subsidize the predatory trading practices that Smith describes. Dodd-Frank is supposed to seriously reform derivatives. Its Volcker Rule is meant to prevent abuses at the discount window.That Treasury officials, responsible for making sure financial reform and other regulations are strongly implemented on behalf of the administration, are taking jobs at firms like Goldman looks like a serious conflict of interest.This is, to say the least, a deeply problematic incentive system. Smith, the insider done right, will lose his multimillion-dollar salary for telling the truth and doing his best to stop the abuse in the banking industry. Siewert, the insider, meanwhile will gain a multimillion-dollar salary for helping spin a still unsolved problem.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 86968}"
