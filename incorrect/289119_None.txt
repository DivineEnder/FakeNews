So I don\\u2019t blame China, I don\\u2019t blame Japan and Mexico and these other countries. They\\u2019re getting away with murder, but if I were them, I\\u2019d be trying to do the same thing. I blame our leaders.\\u00a0I want us to be on the winning side. We will be on the winning side if you elect me on November 8. I promise.\\u00a0I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses. We\\u2019re being abused.The North American Free Trade Agreement, which was agreed to under his opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\\u2019s husband former President Bill Clinton, would also be a target of a Trump administration, he said.\\u201cNumber four: I\\u2019m going to tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that horrible agreement signed by Bill Clinton to get a better deal for our workers. And if we don\\u2019t get the deal that we want, which has to be good and has to make up for all of these years of abuse and lost time, then we will walk away, which is fine.Other actions he included would be a focus China as a currency manipulator and as a country that engages in the practice of unfairly subsidizing certain companies.\\u201cI\\u2019m going to instruct my treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, the greatest in the world. Any country that devalues their currency in order to take unfair advantage of the United States and all of its companies who can\\u2019t compete will face tariffs and taxes to stop the cheating. And when they see that, they will stop the cheating.\\u00a0I don\\u2019t think our politicians even know what\\u2019s going on. And they will stop or we\\u2019re going to take in one hell of a lot of money, I\\u2019ll tell you that.\\u201d\\u201cI\\u2019m going to instruct the United States trade representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO, World Trade Organization,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cChina\\u2019s unfair subsidy and its behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance into the WTO, and I intend to enforce our rules. That\\u2019s all. Very simple.\\u00a0And they know it\\u2019s coming. They\\u2019ve called a lot of friends of mine. They know it\\u2019s coming. They say, \\u2018What do we do? What do we do?'\\u201dThose acts Trump said would reduce $505 billion trade deficit the United States has with the Chinese.Lastly, he included ending government corruption and took aim squarely at Hillary Clinton.\\u201cLet me tell you a few more things that we\\u2019re going to do. We\\u2019re going to end government corruption,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cHillary Clinton ran the State Department like a failed leader in a third-world country. That\\u2019s what it\\u2019s run \\u2014 it\\u2019s run like a third- world country. She sold favors and access in exchange for cash. She sold it. She sold favors, she sold access, and wait until you see when it\\u2019s revealed all of those people.\\u00a0Now, it looks like it\\u2019s 50 percent of the people that saw her had to make contributions to the Clinton Foundation. Wait until you see ultimately what she did for all of those people. Wait until you see. These are not people that go in, as I said, and talk about, how are you feeling.\\u201dFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor\", \"source_id\": 2}"
