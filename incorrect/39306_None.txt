He had spent 11 years leading the public universities in Minnesota and Texas.As UC president, Yudof was one of the nation's most highly paid college administrators, earning an annual salary of $591,084 \\u2014 almost triple what Napolitano makes as Homeland Security secretary \\u2014 plus car and housing allowances, retirement contributions and other benefits that brought his annual compensation at more than $925,000.Napolitano will take over at a time of improving but still serious financial challenges for the university system, including rising costs for employee salaries and retirement benefits.After several years of deep budget cuts, Gov. Jerry Brown earlier this month signed a state budget that boosts funding for UC.University regents on Wednesday scaled back plans for price increases on graduate programs.The university had considered raising prices for professional degrees in 29 programs. Instead, regents approved increases for eight programs.\", \"source_id\": 1}"
