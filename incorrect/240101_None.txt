"{\"title\": \"Levin Smacks Kristol on Tax Liberalism\", \"content\": \"Levin busted Kristol in the lip for that foolhardy remark:Among the others who I think it\\u2019s time just to go someplace and talk among yourselves, would be Bill Kristol. I don\\u2019t know what he\\u2019s added to anything other than giving aid and comfort to Obama\\u2019s attack on capitalism and successful people. This has to be the 40th time he\\u2019s said something on this \\u2026He doesn\\u2019t even know what he\\u2019s talking about. Takes it to 39.6 and depending on your capital gains situation, when you sell your home that\\u2019s another 3.8 percent, and we\\u2019re talking about a million small businesses. I mean, he doesn\\u2019t understand the gravity of this situation. On top of that, the principle behind and I don\\u2019t mean a theoretical principle, I mean a real, live, moral, tangible principle. It does nothing to slow the spending. This money\\u2019s not going to the debt. This money\\u2019s going to be spent before it\\u2019s even collected.And then finally, does Kristol know what Obama\\u2019s all about?

Oh then one other finally \\u2014 you just undermined your base in the Republican Party. It\\u2019s not a base for the rich. Stop talking like the lib you used to be, Bill. We\\u2019re talking about defending private property rights. We\\u2019re talking about defending people whoever they are, however much they earn, whether they\\u2019re white, black, yellow, whatever \\u2014 defending their right to earn a living, to create, to produce.Levin is the firebrand author of Liberty and Tyranny and Ameritopia, in addition to hosting The Mark Levin Show, heard by 8.25 million people each week.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 240101}"
