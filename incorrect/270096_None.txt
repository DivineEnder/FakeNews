"{\"article_id\": 270096, \"content\": \"Nine years after her murder, the Chandra Levy trial started Monday in  Washington, D.C., and although there may be justice for the victim,  there\\u2019s little that can be done to even the scales for Gary Condit, the  man who was falsely accused of killing her.Condit, who was a California valley Congressman at the time, was  suspected of having Chandra kidnapped and murdered when no evidence  supported that claim.Condit\\u2019s problem was that he had a brief relationship with Chandra  while she was interning for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons back in 2001.  Naturally, when she disappeared, the media assumed Condit had something  to do with it.Why?Because thanks to Hollywood and the tabloid press, the American  public has believed for decades there is a secret Washington underground  network for powerful politicians and corporations that enables them to  have \\u201ctroublemakers\\u201d removed and \\u201ctaken care of.\\u201dOliver Stone suggested in his movie, JFK that the federal  government had President Kennedy assassinated. Murder at 1600 told a  thrilling fictional tale in which White House officials framed their own  president for the murder of a young staffer. John Grisham\\u2019s novel, The  Pelican Brief pinned the assassination of two U.S. Supreme Court  justices on a high-powered white collar Washington law firm.But does any of this actually happen in real life?As a former Washington, D.C. prosecutor who tried criminal cases in  the nation\\u2019s capital and dealt regularly with the FBI, Secret Service  and U.S. Capitol Police, I\\u2019ve never heard of a single instance in which  anyone disappeared or was murdered by government officials.There is no secret, underground Washington network.Despite the abuse of power we sometimes see in Washington on the  House and Senate floors or from the Oval Office, it\\u2019s highly doubtful  that abuse of power includes kidnapping and murder. This isn\\u2019t Saddam  Hussein\\u2019s Iraq or the former USSR.This is the mentality, however, that deluded Americans into believing  that Gary Condit was guilty \\u2013 the fictional existence of \\u201cthey,\\u201d as a  secret society in Washington. That was the real tabloid story the press  was interested in. Gary Condit was just a mere example of what everyone  thought was behind the royal curtains of the power elite, and they were  excited they\\u2019d finally caught one of these devious Washingtonians in the  act.The tabloids crucified Condit, and late night cable news channels  followed those stories featuring so-called \\u201cexperts\\u201d who didn\\u2019t hesitate  to ramble on and on with baseless theories.In 2002, a prominent criminal defense lawyer from California was  quoted once as saying he could \\u201cprove\\u201d Gary Condit was responsible for  Chandra\\u2019s murder and that he had her corpse dumped in Baltimore Harbor.  In 2001, Dominick Dunne from Vanity Fair reported that he had sources in  the Middle East that swore Chandra was sold there as a sex slave.None of that was true.It turns out her corpse was lying in Rock Creek Park as the alleged  victim of a no-name, common criminal who had a history of violence. So  much for the conspiracy theories about the Washington power elite. So  much for Baltimore Harbor and being sold into white slavery to Middle  Eastern sheiks.None of that was remotely true, which should make us all take a  moment and reconsider the most important lesson that arose out of the  Chandra Levy case, that journalism should be based on facts, not  theories.In 2006, I spoke directly with one of the lead detectives from the  Washington, D.C. Metro Police Department who was assigned to the Chandra  Levy case. I was intrigued when he told me they had \\u201cno interest in  Gary Condit as a suspect,\\u201d and as a result, I pitched that story to  several news outlets. To my surprise no one was interested in reporting  it.Maybe that\\u2019s because vindication isn\\u2019t as enticing as accusation.The specific accusations that arose from the national media against  Gary Condit were so detailed they couldn\\u2019t have been anything but pure  fabrication or the result of journalists failing to properly  investigate. In retrospect, some of them were totally absurd and  laughable if the damage they caused to Condit\\u2019s life and career wasn\\u2019t  so tragic.Supermarket tabloid journalism has infiltrated the landscape of  mainstream news convicting people by suspicion in the court of public  opinion, and because people want to believe in conspiracy theories, they  buy into them.After all, it\\u2019s a lot more exciting to believe that a U.S.  Congressman used a secret Washington underground network to have a young  girl kidnapped and murdered than accept the more likely reality that  she was just another victim of violent crime.But after a nine-year investigation, U.S. prosecutors and Washington  detectives are now saying that is the case. Hopefully, there will be  justice for Chandra one way or another. For Gary Condit however, there  isn\\u2019t much that can be done. After all, sticks and stones may break  bones, but words do permanent damage.\", \"title\": \"Gary Condit: A Tragic Victim of Journalism Malpractice\", \"source_id\": 2}"
