"{\"title\": \"'Gran Vitreous' Review: Twin Sticks and Neon\", \"content\": \"All that\\u2019s keeping me from losing my last ship are my twitchy thumbs and my incredible piloting abil-oh, I\\u2019m dead. Then I start it all over again, because this is my (newly generated galaxy) and I\\u2019ll be damned if a bunch of shapes are going to take it over without a fight.Gran Vitreous is a twin stick arena shooter from Heliocentric Studios with a randomly generated selection of levels and loot and a few action RPG mechanics. Do well, and you\\u2019ll improve your ship and your abilities enough to beat whatever the game throws at you. Do poorly and you\\u2019re dead. Do that too many times and you\\u2019ll have to start over. It\\u2019s not exactly an unforgiving game, but it certainly doesn\\u2019t hold your hand.Gran Vitreous is Geometry Wars with looting and randomness in short bursts, and that\\u2019s a comparison made with love. It\\u2019s so close to homage at times that it borders on a lift in terms of general game-play \\u2014 but the randomness, looting, and various weapons distinguish it from the\\u00a0Geometry Wars\\u00a0series pretty quickly. The game generates a galaxy to explore in short bursts instead of a more survival and high score set up, and the whole package works pretty well together.You get a selection of random sectors in your generated galaxy, and each sector has a series of zones with different missions and events. In general you\\u2019ll be piloting your ship (using a twin stick gamepad hopefully, though the game\\u2019s mouse and keyboard set up isn\\u2019t the worst I\\u2019ve experienced) around the small, squared arenas taking out increasingly hellish patterns of ships, or a few bosses, to the game\\u2019s upbeat, dancy soundtrack. Beat a zone, and you\\u2019ll warp home with some credits and experience so you can level up.The gameplay is fast paced, with\\u00a0short bursts of hectic action thankfully broken up by shopping. Between rounds you\\u2019ll trade, upgrade, and choose skills purchased with credits and skill points to improve your ship. It\\u2019s not crucial that you have an min-max\\u00a0combination of weapons, hull, shield, and utilities, so feel free to choose what works for your play style \\u2014 though as usual\\u00a0I found some set ups work better than others.\\u00a0The auto aiming missiles REALLY help when things get hairy and you\\u2019re on the run until you can charge up your main weapon, for example. You\\u2019ll need to improve and customize your ship, because the game\\u2019s difficulty curve is noticeable if you don\\u2019t find a build that works for you. Make sure to upgrade things when you can afford them.There are fair number of enemies \\u2014 though many of them are simple geometry, to be fair. They do each act a bit\\u00a0different, though, and the patterns are varied enough that each round felt pretty fresh. A few more complicated baddies like the battleship join the fray, along with gravity wells, asteroids, and a few other bits of randomness \\u2014 though the game doesn\\u2019t throw a game breaking amount of randomness at you. The selection of loot is decent, and the reroll system to improve weapons and assign new characteristics is\\u00a0pretty well implemented \\u2014 though I always felt a bit poor in the skills department. If you count the random properties/stats of weapons, the weapon variety ends up being plenty for the job.It rarely gets to (what I\\u2019d consider) a \\u201cbullet hell\\u201d shooter, but it can get pretty intense, especially when you\\u2019ve got a few dozen enemies chasing you around the arena as still more are spawning. The engine strikes a pretty decent balance between randomness and not throwing the whole thing into chaos \\u2014\\u00a0though every now and again it will generate a level that makes you want to throw a controller. Full disclosure: I\\u2019m not great at twin stick shooters, so my frustration is likely to be greater\\u00a0than yours \\u2014 I am old, and I have stubby thumbs.The graphics are, to be fair, uneven in places, but the colors pop and remind you (yet again) of those Geometry Wars high score couch sessions. The ships and a few larger enemy vessels\\u00a0sort of stand out amid the pretty neon and geometry as looking like Flash game\\u00a0art assets\\u00a0and dated \\u2014 but\\u00a0it\\u2019s not too terrible, and it\\u2019s just a few pieces of art that aren\\u2019t up to the rest of the package. It doesn\\u2019t hurt anything.The music is fun and fitting \\u2014 it keeps a nice pace with the speed of the game and never outstays its welcome. The sound effects are vintage arcade-style boops and beeps, but the pleasant kind that remind you of a childhood playing games at your local Family Fun Center before signing your high score \\u201cASS,\\u201d \\u201cACE,\\u201d or \\u201cBAD\\u201d. If someone put this into an arcade cabinet, I\\u2019d put a quarter in and feel right at home.If Gran Vitreous was more expensive, I\\u2019d probably suggest you buy it on sale, but honestly it only cost me five dollars. So due to its low price, tight controls, and solid levels of fun, Gran Vitreous is a buy \\u2014 assuming you\\u2019re into twin-stick arena shooters. It doesn\\u2019t reinvent the wheel, but it provides a satisfying amount of space shooting action for the price of a hamburger, and that\\u2019s a tough deal not to recommend.Grab a copy if you\\u2019re in the market, you\\u2019ll have a good time.Follow Will Ross on Twitter\\u00a0@SawmillLoris.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 159395}"
