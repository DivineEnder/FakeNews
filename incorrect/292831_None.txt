You may be weirded out but do read on. I have a point. There are many reasons not to make an abusive relationship public, mostly fear. Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional.\\u201dShe added:When I broke up with my ex this summer, it wasn\\u2019t because I didn\\u2019t love him, it was because of this. And I absolutely relapsed and contacted him with things I shouldn\\u2019t have, but there are no \\u201cbest practices\\u201d with this. When friends or comics ask why we broke up it\\u2019s not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn\\u2019t seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It\\u2019s embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It\\u2019s not simple. After I broke up with him he said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you\\u2019re talking about.\\u201d And I abided.I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A. and I didn\\u2019t want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn\\u2019t understand. I don\\u2019t want revenge or to hurt him now, but it\\u2019s unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life. It\\u2019s how I make my living. My personal is my professional.That is how I\\u2019ve always been; I make dark, funny. So now I\\u2019m allowing this to be part of my story. It\\u2019s not my only story, so please don\\u2019t let it be. If you live in L.A., you\\u2019ve already started to hear my jokes about this and I ask you to have the courage to listen and accept it because I\\u2019m trying. Already since talking about this onstage, many women have come to me after shows asking me to keep doing it. Men have shown their solidarity.Stelling also revealed she is not the only victim of the man who allegedly assaulted and abused her, as other women in the \\u201cL.A. comedy community\\u201d had experienced \\u201cthe same fate\\u201d with him.Stelling recently released the comedy album Simply The Beth on iTunes and hosted a half-hour special on Comedy Central, in which she detailed the \\u201cweird aspects of being a female comic.\\u201dHere are her two Instagram posts in full:Same girl in all of these photos (me).

An ex-girlfriend of this ex-boyfriend came to me and shared that she experienced the same fate. Then there was another and another (men and women) who shared other injustices at his hand that..A photo posted by Beth Stelling (@bethstelling) on Dec 28, 2015 at 9:30am PSTMy original post was too long so I put the final paragraph after the ellipses in the comments section not realizing that so many would be reached.
