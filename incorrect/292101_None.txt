"{\"title\": \"Debra Messing Explodes on Susan Sarandon for Suggesting Trump Is Better Than Hillary\", \"content\": \"Actress Debra Messing unloaded on fellow actress Susan Sarandon this week after Sarandon said in an interview that she wouldn\\u2019t necessarily vote for Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton if her chief rival Bernie Sanders does not win the nomination.In an interview with MSNBC\\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, Sarandon said that she is going to \\u201csee what happens\\u201d if Sanders falls to Clinton in the primary, indicating she may not vote for Clinton in the general election.\\u201cYou know, some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately,\\u201d Sarandon told Hayes. \\u201cIf he gets in then things will really explode. Some people feel that.\\u201dSarandon\\u2019s comments apparently angered Messing, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter who took issue with Sarandon\\u2019s seeming semi-endorsement of Trump over Clinton (an endorsement that Sarandon later clarified and withdrew by saying she would \\u201cnever\\u201d vote for Trump.)The two actresses sent some messages back and forth on Twitter, but according to Us, the feud escalated when Messing retweeted someone who\\u2019d written: \\u201c@DebraMessing = national treasure. @SusanSarandon = national embarrassment.\\u201dMessing later deleted the retweet but drew return fire from Sarandon, who tweeted:\\u201dnow RT-ing personal attacks. Cool.\\u201d.@DebraMessing now RT-ing personal attacks. Cool.  https://t.co/ajOo2NcCur\\u2014 Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) March 30, 2016.@DebraMessing Right, the diff is I'm not RT attacks on u to 350K+ followers\\u2014 Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) March 31, 2016The feud continued Wednesday and even into Thursday morning, with Messing questioning how Sarandon could decide not to vote for Clinton in a general election if Trump were the Republican nominee. Sarandon defended herself and picked up some support from Rosie O\\u2019Donnell and Kirstie Alley.1-You are not a first time voter.Your position,as a life long advocate 4 the underepresented,is what matters to me. https://t.co/oLueAHCaUe\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 20162-Your voice is powerful and influential. You not clearly disavowing Trump implies that u consider him (vs Hillary) https://t.co/oLueAHCaUe\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 20163- There are people who need protections, and B Bernie or Hillary have that as a priority. Trump does not.  https://t.co/oLueAHCaUe\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016of course you have the right. But if you Stand behind liberal democratic IDEALS you can't defend voting for Trump. https://t.co/pqUSlHvoil\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016It is to my too. Outrageous, actually if she doesn't believe that she should SAY it. Too important for our country   https://t.co/iCDm36rfVE\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016i do acknowledge it. A no vote  is a vote for Trump. Just like with Nader electing Bush.  https://t.co/ShnXNY0Q38\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016i want better social policies too. Saying if its Hillary/Trumo that we'll get that from Trump is untruthful. https://t.co/R7P3Ay4g3H\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016no we don't. But i believe we owe the country. https://t.co/HcLhgOjyRO\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016THAT is my point. Thank you for making it clear. https://t.co/RQxID565Pk\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016That's not my intention. Vote for Bernie. i am making BS supporters who wuld vote4Trump over Hillary feel like shit. https://t.co/CIoaL2u3CL\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016it disturbs me that some diehard Bernie supporters ARENT. https://t.co/FXrrgT9N75\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016Oh how i wish it was satire. It represents the Bernie or BUST position which is so dangerous for our country.  https://t.co/4kedphdSzI\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016That's not the discussion. The question was a hypothetical one posed to Susan Sarandon. IF it was HRC/DT. https://t.co/OsgfkLOLGU\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016would the change you want more likely or less likely come from Trump? THATS the question.  https://t.co/rwLD5kyW39\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016so selfish. https://t.co/QIxEJ2loaU\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016i  admire her philanthropic work. Im going to Malawi in June as Ambassador for YouthAIDS. What have you done? https://t.co/DrCDWDi2fQ\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016its a question EVERY candidate is being asked by journalists. It reveals what principles are important to you. https://t.co/a2Lszyl6Va\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016so u R ready 2 have yr Rights over yr body repealed? Discrimination policies reversed? if that's the case, carry on. https://t.co/POpgMLBGtK\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016That's their prerogative. Just know that that is a vote FOR Trump. If he becomes Prez, you are partly responsible. https://t.co/Sz6Wa4J6JE\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016I DID. And I heard what she did not say. https://t.co/NG3ZQyHXTK\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016I believe she is. What's disappointing is her not saying it last night. @SusanSarandon  https://t.co/3LOeUDRblb\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016NOONE is taking Independents' votes 4granted. My Point is their vote is IMPORTANT. The question posed was Hillary v Trump. @SusanSarandon\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016She can vote for whomever she likes. My problem is hypocrisy- saying you advocate for women, minorities&considrg  DT https://t.co/IZl0QifHvt\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016ATTACKING? Are you on crack?! We are being playful. Lightening things up after an intense day. https://t.co/aex4zxArKJ\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016Right.HRC was Secretary of State, First Lady & Senator. She is most qualified & prepared to be commander in Chief. https://t.co/XZq8Vt3tod\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016I believe she meant a \\\"revolution\\\" was needed and if not thru Bernie, than at least thru Trump.  https://t.co/sv1cAkqq37\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016Um, she walked in the Gay Pride Parade in NYC in 2010. https://t.co/5NJ9d1yBGF\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 20161000s of people took it exactly the same way. https://t.co/tp2BtKJPt1\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016ME dividing dems!? Pls read the beginning of the conversation. Your point was MY point to SS. https://t.co/8RAyhTslxp\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016As of today HRC has 2 1/2 mill more votes than BS and 1 mill more votes than Trump. She has a better chance. https://t.co/kPDGPBr45z\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016Well, I admire people who apologize if they've misstepped. I did with RT. I'm hoping she will apologize for hers. https://t.co/KNs1h1ovQL\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016She has been fighting for children & the disenfranchised for Decades. She is the real deal. https://t.co/KZGM2gEkcq\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016We understand.

I said if it's Bernie/Trump I will Absolutely support Bernie. Doesn't make me less passionate about Hillary. https://t.co/FCmuSg59rR\\u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 31, 2016Agreed Trump doesn\\u2019t, but she is not protective till it's easy. Bernie makes morally correct choices when unpopular. https://t.co/28QVTpA4rI\\u2014 Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) March 30, 2016I was explaining to not take those voters for granted which will affect the platfiorm. https://t.co/24TNEVGep1\\u2014 Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) March 30, 2016This is y Bernie beats Trump by wider margin in polls & y independent voter support 4 HC can\\u2019t be taken for granted. https://t.co/ZT7xKOeC6a\\u2014 Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) March 30, 2016Dear @PerezHilton cc: @DebraMessing https://t.co/fZrMMsbtF3   https://t.co/2tgThs4OaG\\u2014 Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) March 30, 2016.@kathynajimy I don't \\u201chint.\\\" It's important to understand that principled people, especially  environmentalists (1/2)\\u2014 Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) March 31, 2016.@kathynajimy may not vote for a fracking candidate.
