Prices were as low as $1,241.50 a troy ounce earlier in the session.The U.S. economy isn\\u2019t creating much urgency for the Fed to tighten monetary policy, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President \\n      William Dudley\\n       said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Expectations of a slower pace of rate increases tend to boost gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing investments when rates rise.Gold prices are on track for around an 8% gain this quarter, benefiting from a weaker dollar and doubts over how quickly the White House can push through promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending.Prices could rise as high as $1,300 a troy ounce in the next several months, if it appears President Donald Trump\\u2019s legislative agenda is increasingly in doubt, analysts at Standard Bank said in a note to clients.Silver for March delivery was up 0.3% at $18.25 a troy ounce. June platinum was down 0.4% at $952.40 a troy ounce, and June palladium rose 0.1% to $798.15 a troy ounce.Meanwhile, the price of copper fell on news that industrial action at \\n        Freeport-McMoRan\\n        \\u2019s\\n       Peruvian Cerro Verde mine has ended.March copper closed down 0.7% at $2.6525 a pound in New York.The global copper market had been supported by three major supply-side problems a little more than a week ago.
