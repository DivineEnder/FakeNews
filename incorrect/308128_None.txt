"{\"title\": \"EXCLUSIVE \\u2013 Terrorist's Former Mosque: 'No Comment' on Broader FBI Investigations\", \"content\": \"After Friday afternoon prayers, the\\u00a0Dar Al Uloom Al Islamiyah of America invited journalists in for a 30 minute long press conference, during which they refused to tell journalists whether or not the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had made enquiries about other members of the congregation.Journalists posed the question over half a dozen times, to three different spokesmen from the organisation. The reply that kept coming, in different forms, was \\u201cno comment\\u201d.\\u201cSo, you guys are our guests,\\u201d one speaker said. \\u201cAnd if we have no comment, you cannot force us to have a comment\\u201d.Other journalists noted that residents of San Bernardino should be told as to whether or not the mosque knew of others amongst their congregation who are being investigated. Later, they asked that further media requests were handled by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).While common practice at mosques, female journalists \\u2013 including Breitbart News\\u2019s Michelle Moons \\u2013 were asked to enter the prayer room in which the press conference was being held via a separate door, and sit on seats on one side while male reporters stood in front of the lectern.Journalists reacted confused, though respectful, and were not asked to cover their heads, arms, or shoulders where it applied.Spokesmen for the mosque, including one named Roshan Abbasi, said that he \\u2013 as an Arabic teacher \\u2013 didn\\u2019t teach people in the mosque about the Islamic caliphate: the Islamic belief that there should be an Islamic state spanning the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. Breitbart London\\u2019s Raheem Kassam asked if he believed in an Islamic caliphate \\u2013 a question that Mr. Abbasi left unanswered.The spokesmen were also asked by Breitbart News about their views on the penalty of death for leaving Islam (apostasy) which is promoted by many Islamic scholars. The mosque leaders distanced themselves from this interpretation of Islam, stating again that taking a human life is as bad as taking the life of the whole of humanity.A full video of the press conference will be available on Breitbart News\\u2019s YouTube Channel, during which mosque leaders reiterated that Islam prohibits killing, and compared the San Bernardino terrorist attack to the Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado last week.Gasser Shehata, a regular at the mosque, told Breitbart News that no one in the mosque held radical opinions. He said during the press conference: \\u201cI know everybody here. And nobody here is having extremist ideas, including Rizwan (Syed Farook) by the way.\\u201dHe said of the mosque\\u2019s political leanings, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t like Donald Trump\\u201d.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 308128}"
