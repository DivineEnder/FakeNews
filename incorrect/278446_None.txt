"{\"title\": \"CBS Early Show: 'Friends Defend Polanski'\", \"content\": \"\\n\\u2014\\nWow. That is quite a moment in the \\u201c60 Minutes\\u201d interview when director Roman Polanski says of the 13 year-old girl he drugged, raped and sodomized:\\n\\u201cShe wasn\\u2019t unschooled in sexual matters. She was consenting and willing\\u2026\\u201d\\nFirst off, the victim disagrees. Secondly, if she was so willing,  why the Quaalude?\\nPolanski may be a monster, but he\\u2019s Hollywood\\u2019s Monster, and  they are the rich and powerful elite in this town and that  matters. And what does it say about Polanski\\u2019s defenders in both the entertainment industry and media that they consider his  living luxuriously  in Europe as  \\u201ca horrible, soul-wrenching price  for the infamy surrounding his actions\\u201c?\\nNo one can see into Polanski\\u2019s wrenching soul, so maybe that\\u2019s true. But to those of us who are not morally illiterate, child rapists are  supposed to wrench their  souls behind bars, not  while being the toast of Europe.\\nI\\u2019m guessing Polanski\\u2019s next move will be to make a statement supporting universal health care for all  Americans. That should pretty well cover his left flank.     \", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 278446}"
