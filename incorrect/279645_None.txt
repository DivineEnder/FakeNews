"{\"article_id\": 279645, \"title\": \"How Sean Penn Won the War\", \"content\": \"This week\\u2019s Washington Times column:\\n\\nYes, that Sean Penn: Hollywood actor, director, tough guy and agent provocateur in America\\u2019s time of peril \\u2013 a man history, no doubt, will credit with an assist in bringing democracy to Iraq.It is now time for Mr. Penn to end his service to his country and commit to the next chapter in his life. He has done more than enough. America simply doesn\\u2019t make medals for Mr. Penn\\u2019s kind of service. Nor would he accept them. Now he must come clean and take on the next challenge of his career: Bring the rest of Hollywood to America\\u2019s aid by creating an army of underground patriots.With a Democrat as commander in chief, it\\u2019s now or never for Tinseltown to get the patriotic bug. Since his friends and political allies don\\u2019t read this column, I feel comfortable outing the left-wing agitator as an unsung patriot in the war on terrorism. I know that other entertainment media outlets are working this blockbuster story and that the mainstream media is still figuring out how to play it. Like in his Oscar-winning acting, Mr. Penn has broken all the rules.In late 2002, Mr. Penn toured Saddam Hussein\\u2019s Baghdad with his camera and offered the Pentagon precise locations for bombing. \\u201cShock and Awe\\u201d was a rousing success to a great extent because a courageous and humble actor put country first and used a pliant media to create a believable character: an angry Hollywood actor turned antiwar activist and citizen journalist.There\\u2019s a reason we call him America\\u2019s greatest actor: We all believed it!Who else could he have gotten a camera into Saddam\\u2019s media-controlled country right before we went to war? Countless lives were saved because Mr. Penn isolated Ba\\u2019athist strongholds and made sure that hospitals and nurseries were spared.In a profession in which reputation is everything, Mr. Penn has been willing to sacrifice his own to ensure the good guys won and that millions of Iraqis were emancipated from unspeakable human rights horrors. The media would have crucified him if he were open to making millions of Iraqis free. So instead he went underground. Deep underground. Times are too complicated for a straightforward hero \\u2013 so we got an edgy, postmodern one. Cool.You can read the column in full here.\", \"source_id\": 2}"
