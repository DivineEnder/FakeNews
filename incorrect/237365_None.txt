General Assembly on Wednesday (AFP)Ignoring bitter opposition from Russia and Syria, the United NationsGeneral Assembly approved a non-binding resolution condemning theregime of Syria\\u2019s president Bashar al-Assad for using heavy militaryweapons on civilians, and for systematic violations of human rights.Syria\\u2019s permanent Envoy to the UN Bashar al-Jaafari addressed theGeneral Assembly with a bitter attack on the Arab League, whichsponsored the current resolution and which, in the past, has expelledthe Syrian government representative from the Arab League and replaceit with a representative of the opposition:\\u201cGiving Syria\\u2019s seat to the al-Doha [Qatar] coalitionin the Arab League and the attempt to get the UN involved bygiving a [delusional] representation to its aim at breaking offthe road in front of the solution to the crisis and tearing downthe Syrian state.\\nWe bring your attention to the destructive role of the ArabLeague, led by Qatar and Saudi Arabia in addition to Turkeyagainst Syria as the Arab League has given legitimacy to providethe terrorists with weapons.\\u201dThe Saudi envoy responded by repeating many of the horrors thatthe al-Assad inflicted on innocent civilians \\u2014 from bloody massacresof peaceful protesters to mass slaughter of innocent students intheir college dormitories while they were asleep.The General Assembly approved the measure by a vote of 107 to 12, with45 member states abstaining.  The \\u201cyes\\u201d vote was a lot lower than thevote last August on a similar resolution, where 133 states votedsupported the resolution this time is because many of them arebeginning to believe that with help from Russia and Iran, al-Assad isgoing to win the war, war crimes and all.From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, that expectation isnot realistic.  Syria is in a generational Awakening era, like Americain the 1960s, and the young Sunni fighters are not going to capitulateto the Shia Alawite regime.
