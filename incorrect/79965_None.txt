"{\"article_id\": 79965, \"title\": \"Steyer's super weird ads\", \"content\": \"Innovative? Or just plain weird?Liberal billionaire Tom Steyer is trying to sway national climate policy and the midterm elections with an ad campaign that is raising eyebrows among independent fact-checkers, some television stations, his political opponents and even a few allies \\u2014 using an approach that strikes observers as anywhere from groundbreaking to downright bizarre.In Iowa, Steyer\\u2019s super PAC is attacking Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst with 60-second TV ads featuring a pair of cigar-chomping executives cackling in a darkened room, gleeful that an anti-tax pledge she signed will send jobs overseas. The fact-checking website PolitiFact labeled that ad \\u201cfalse,\\u201d and fact-checkers have also found holes in Steyer-backed ads that accuse Florida Gov. Rick Scott of benefiting from oil drilling near the Everglades and letting a power company \\u201cfleece\\u201d its customers. Ernst and Scott have threatened legal action.Previous ads from Steyer followed similar patterns. One last year portrayed the CEO of TransCanada, the company that wants to build the Keystone XL pipeline, yelling \\u201cYippee!\\u201d and becoming soaked with oil as he slides through the project. A 2012 ad Steyer bankrolled during a California referendum fight featured a suit-and-tie-clad feline as the \\u201cFat Cat\\u201d in an old-time carnival freak show.( Check out the latest polls here)He\\u2019s also paid for a $1 million, four-part series of 90-second ads in which Steyer traveled the country attacking Keystone, as well as minimalist 15-second TV spots \\u2014 featuring crickets and chicks but no dialogue \\u2014 that taunt billionaires Charles and David Koch for refusing to debate climate change.Steyer\\u2019s aides say the ads are meant to be striking and unconventional \\u2014 and they\\u2019re certainly no amateur operation: His more recent TV spots were handled by GMMB, the award-winning firm that worked on both of President Barack Obama\\u2019s White House campaigns. The ads are part of Steyer\\u2019s pledge to spend $100 million or more to influence seven bellwether Senate and gubernatorial races this November.But political and media professionals are divided on whether they work.\\u201cThey\\u2019re unconventional in some cases, a bit bizarre in some cases, a bit opaque, more than the usual amount of snark, visually different in many cases,\\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, vice president of Kantar Media\\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. \\u201cThe ads taken together are obviously made to stand out in some way.\\u201d( Who's up, who's down in the latest race rankings?)Todd Harris, whose media firm produces ads for Ernst\\u2019s campaign, said Steyer\\u2019s ads \\u201care a metaphor for the kind of federal government that he wants \\u2014 which is big, bloated, inefficient and expensive. It\\u2019s this mind-set like, \\u2018Why do in 30 seconds what we can spend millions to do in 60?\\u2019\\u201dEven the Republican consultant who infamously lumped triple-amputee Vietnam War veteran Max Cleland with Osama bin Laden in a 2002 campaign ad thinks Steyer\\u2019s attack on Ernst goes a tad too far.But Steyer\\u2019s ads also have admirers \\u2014 in both parties.\\u201cThey are first class. Punchy. Clever. Clear. On message,\\u201d Republican strategist Mark McKinnon said in an email after viewing a half-dozen Steyer ads flagged by POLITICO. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a competitive environment out there, but these are the kind of ads that will cut through the clutter.\\u201d( Sign up for POLITICO\\u2019s Morning Energy tip sheet)That\\u2019s exactly what they\\u2019re designed to do, said top Steyer adviser Chris Lehane, calling them provocative enough to stand out.\\u201cCampaigns have to buy more and more and more TV because TV has become less and less and less efficient as a way to have your message have any kind of an impact,\\u201d said Lehane, a veteran Democratic strategist. Usually, he said, \\u201cthere\\u2019s a \\u2018cheeseburger, cheeseburger\\u2019 element to the ads [that] you can almost regurgitate in any number of states.\\u201dDemocratic strategist Jonathan Prince agreed.\\u201cWe all know political ads suck, they\\u2019ve sucked for a million years,\\u201d he said, adding that traditional political messaging can be hampered by limited dollars, a reserved, cookie-cutter style and lack of self-awareness. \\u201cBut if you\\u2019re Tom and Chris and you have the money to spend and you are your own bosses, you have the freedom to be a little more aggressive.\\u201d( Also on POLITICO: Full energy and environment policy coverage)Prince particularly admired the \\u201ccampiness\\u201d in the anti-Ernst ad. \\u201cYou have to accept from the beginning that your audience, generally speaking, is kind of in on the joke,\\u201d he said.That ad, part of a $2.6 million series of TV spots that Steyer\\u2019s NextGen Climate Action Committee is running against Ernst, attacks the Republican Senate hopeful for signing an anti-tax-hike pledge promoted by conservative activist Grover Norquist.\\u201cJoni. Signed. On. The line,\\u201d one of the executives says in the ad, which is loaded with shadowy lighting, pregnant pauses and a briefcase that some viewers saw as a nod to the movie \\u201cPulp Fiction.\\u201d \\u201cThe tax breaks that thing protects \\u2014 are gold. Greenlight more outsourcing. China, Mexico, all the way.\\u201d\\u201cShe isn\\u2019t worried about Iowa jobs?\\u201d the other executive asks.( Also on POLITICO: Big money goes small town)\\u201cOh, never mind that,\\u201d says the first businessman, opening the briefcase and gazing into it. \\u201cJoni Ernst is with us.\\u201dA Washington Post writer called it \\u201csurely one of the most bizarre political ads of the 2014 election \\u2014 and not really bizarre in a good way.\\u201dThe Steyer-backed ad has the look and feel of \\u201chighly slick public access commercials,\\u201d said Lisa Camooso Miller, a GOP and industry strategist and former Republican National Committee spokeswoman. \\u201cYou may be watching a commercial for a loan shark or a local car dealer.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1}"
