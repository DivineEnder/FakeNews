"{\"title\": \"Veterans March in Silkies for Comradery and Suicide Awareness\", \"content\": \"The march was billed as \\u201c22 with 22 for the 22,\\u201d referring to the number of suicides that are committed every day by military veterans. They marched 22 kilometers (13.6 miles) with backpacks weighing 22 kilograms (48.5 pounds).The Department of Veteran Affairs issued a Suicide Data Report\\u00a0in 2012 which reported that 22 veterans a day commit suicide. Many suffer from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).Veterans marching for veterans in Houston\\u2019s Memorial Park.The initial march\\u00a0took place\\u00a0in San Diego with marines and combat veterans. The concept expanded to\\u00a0Houston with veterans from all branches of the military. The Houston organizer said it was important for him to organize the event within a week of an event in San Diego. It was also important for him to open the event up to all veterans with all types of problems.It was very fitting that participants started their march at Houston\\u2019s Memorial Park, one of the largest parks in this vast\\u00a0urban city. The land where the park is located was the site of Camp Logan, a World War I US Army training camp. A prominent Houston family purchased the land and dedicated it as a memorial to soldiers who lost their lives serving in World War I.Donny O\\u2019Malley, the founder of Irreverent Warriors in San Diego, California, marched with the veterans in Houston. His organization held the first \\u201c22 event\\u201d on July 25th in San Diego.\\u00a0The website for his organization states, \\u201cIn order for us to cope, to process, and to deal with what we\\u2019ve done and seen, combat veterans have to get together, we have to be there for each other, we have to be able to talk to each other, laugh about our experiences, and understand that everything we did, thought, and saw, was what we needed to do, think, and see, in order to protect our country.\\u201dFemale former Marine Corps veterans also marched.The goal of the Irreverent Warriors group is for their 22 event to be a catalyst for other such events across the country. They say, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t need to raise awareness for the 22, the whole country is already talking about it. What we need to raise awareness about is how to effectively help the 22, and the answer is simple. Facilitate communication amongst combat veterans\\u00a0of the same unit and same deployment, or of the same battlefield. Warriors have a powerful connection to the lands they fought on.\\u201dThe Irreverent Warriors describe themselves as \\u201cguys who have used humor to get through the darkest side of humanity. We are infantrymen, special operators, engineers, corpsman, combat medics, and anyone who has been attached to grunts and operators- and walked into the fire of combat.\\u201dVeterans marching for veterans in Houston\\u2019s Memorial Park.O\\u2019Malley told Breitbart Texas, \\u201cI want civilians to know that the best way to help a loved one who is struggling with demons from combat is to put their loved one in touch with someone they served with in combat. Reconnecting with old battle buddies \\u2014 or even guys who fought on the same battlefield \\u2014 fuels the soul better than anything.\\u201dCesar Gill told the Houston Chronicle that he has lost eight friends to suicide. He said, \\u201cWhen you\\u2019re in the Corps, you\\u2019re part of a wolf pack. When you get out, you can feel lost. Bringing everyone together today, we\\u2019re a pack again and no longer sheep.\\u201d Gill served in the Marines from 2003 to 2007.Mark A. Metzger III, a Houston criminal defense lawyer and former marine, organized the Houston event. He told Breitbart Texas the event was an Irreverent Warriors event \\u201cbut with a twist.\\u201d He said Irreverent Warriors are combat veterans and they \\u201cfocus on how to get them through that.\\u201dMarine Corps Veteran Mark MetzgerMetzger said his intent was to help all branches of the military by getting them together, and to help veterans with all problems. He said it was about \\u201cmore than just having guys put a bullet in their head.\\u201dVeterans suffer from loneliness, isolation, depression, and drug and alcohol addiction, Metzger said. \\u201cCouple that with financial and relationship problems and an inability to assimilate to civilian life, and it can become a big problem.\\u201d He said at that point, \\u201cThe only option is to remove yourself from the equation. This is where you get the situation where they remove themselves out.\\u201dHe said there is \\u201cthis constant fear because if you don\\u2019t use humor, you\\u2019re only option is to fear.\\u201dMetzger said he \\u201cwanted to add everyone out there. We miss our brother, our comradery.\\u201d He continued, \\u201cbeing in the military is the best time in your life. You miss that time, there is a common thread. Talking to each other, just for one day, then suddenly life does not seem so bad. You have some good in your life.\\u201dThe criminal defense lawyer and former\\u00a0marine said, \\u201cIf we can stop that decision, just take the gun down and put it on the nightstand. Then the chances are they will never pick it up again.\\u201dHe said these walks are great because \\u201cyou combine humor and fun, comradery, and a little bit of pain (the hike and sun).\\u201dMetzger is planning another event for veterans in Houston next\\u00a0January. He said, \\u201cwe are about extreme craziness, when it\\u2019s about 30 degrees. It was 100 degrees in Houston [when we did this walk].\\u201dJohnny Joseph Jones, a double-amputee and a marine, EOD (Explosive Ordinance\\u00a0Disposal) tech is planning an event for\\u00a0Austin.Double-amputee, Marine Corps Veteran Johnny Joseph JonesThese events are just for veterans. The Houston organizer said, \\u201cIf you have not served, you do not understand. We have to be able to be ourselves.\\u201dThe veterans who participated in the event in Houston were a bit outrageous, some of them did a little drinking, and they were in their underwear, but they are doing what they know works for them. Metzger says it works, \\u201cveterans aren\\u2019t going to talk to anyone in a dark room, and medicine is a problem.\\u201dThe Houston veteran said he did not care if some do not understand their methods. Metzger quoted Jack Nicholson from the movie A Few Good Men\\u00a0and said, \\u201cI have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it.\\u201dAll photos courtesy of Marine Corps veterans Mark Metzger and Austin Howard.Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
