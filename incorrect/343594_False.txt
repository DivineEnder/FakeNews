I hope Senator McConnell will bring the bill to the floor. The American people need to have this debate. The Congress needs to step up, and here\\u2019s the question: Are you all in? They are all in against us. They are moving all over the globe.\\u201d\\\",\\\"Mr. McConnell took a procedural step on Thursday that will allow him to put Mr. Graham\\u2019s bill directly on the Senate calendar, bypassing the normal committee process.\\\",\\\"Senate Democrats have not indicated how they will respond to the measure, and it is not clear that a new authorization of force by Congress would change anything.\\\",\\\"Previously, Republicans and Democrats have taken the position that Mr. Obama can rely on the war authorization to combat terrorism that Congress granted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\\\",\\\"Separately on Thursday, Senate Republicans sharply criticized the Obama administration for moving forward with carrying out the president\\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran, saying that the easing of economic sanctions would provide tens of billions of dollars that Iran could use to sponsor terrorist groups.\\\",\\\"Several senators seized on comments by Secretary of State John Kerry at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he said it was possible some money made available to Iran through sanctions relief could ultimately flow to terrorist groups, though he said he did not see the money being directed to such groups yet.\\\",\\\"\\u201cTalk about stating the obvious,\\u201d said Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire.\\\",\\\"\\u201cThey were supporting terrorism when their economy was crippled. They were choosing to put their money into guns, not butter for their citizens, before they had this economic relief. So could it be any more obvious? And to have him actually now say, \\u2018Oh, you know, well, we think some of this might go to terrorists.\\u2019 Duh!\\u201d\\\"}\", \"source_id\": 22236}"
