There would be mockery.\\u201dOf course, we don\\u2019t need to \\u201cimagine\\u201d such a scenario. On a daily basis over at ABC News, former Clinton\\u00a0spokesman\\u00a0George Stephanopoulos is the host of \\u201cGood Morning America,\\u201d \\u201cThis Week\\u201d and serves as primary substitute for ABC network anchor Diane Sawyer on \\u201cABC World News.\\u201d \\u00a0Given the Kurtz Standard, does this take him out of the running for any interview involving former President Bill Clinton or future presidential candidate Hilary Clinton? Remember, Stephanopoulos\\u00a0single-handedly invented the birth control non-controversy lie during 2012\\u2019s presidential campaign. That directly benefitted Hillary Clinton\\u2019s political future since she is now able to run against a GOP challenger rather than an\\u00a0incumbent\\u00a0President Romney. Where is Kurtz\\u2019 criticism?A good faith Google search has turned up no criticism of ABC News when\\u00a0Stephanopoulos interviewed Bill or Hillary in the past, but we\\u2019re sure Kurtz was all over it.\\u00a0Watch Kurtz hammer Fox News here: \\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 139227}"
