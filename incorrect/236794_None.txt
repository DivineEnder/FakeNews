"{\"title\": \"Mike's Message\", \"content\": \"by special Big Hollywood guest correspondent Michael Moore.Hi, gang. Michael Moore here.   I\\u2019ve been thinking a lot about patriotism lately.   I had an interesting conversation with my friend Joe about this, and I thought I\\u2019d share it.\\n\\nSo me and Joe are sitting around at Mavis\\u2019s diner talking.   \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure how a Man of the Left should handle Obama\\u2019s Presidency,\\u201d Joe confides.   I ponder this question as I crush a large joint of mutton down my enormous feeding orifice. The\\nbones crack and pop like July fireworks as my massive tusks rend the  meat and even work the bone into a thick paste of calcium and keratin. Motes of blood spray out of my slavering eat-hole and onto Joe\\u2019s face.   He elegantly sweeps his glasses off his face and wipes the blood away.   \\u201cWe have so long fought the state.   But now we are the state, Mike.   If we indulge in the \\u2018new patriotism,\\u2019 are we hypocrites?   Are we just exchanging one jingoism for another more appealing to us?\\u201dIt\\u2019s a good question, no doubt. I wish I could answer it. I wish I  could answer another question\\u2013 How can I eat this cheesesteak, this  Monte Cristo, and that four-gallon tank of pork lard simultaneously,  when I have only two hands?\\u201cWe know where unchallenged, unthinking adoration of a charismatic leader usually leads.   And yet I find myself drawn to do so nevertheless \\u2014 my heart sings Obama, while my brain whispers caution.\\u201d   I\\u2019d like to tell him I respect his uncommon introspection, but I can\\u2019t speak, as  I currently have my entire ginormous freakhead stuffed into the  rib-cage of dangling cow-carcass the owners of the diner have hung by chains and tenterhooks for me. My daggerlike teeth slice through the raw meat like a squadron of yellow-brown warships upon a blood-red sea.  Apparently my face shows a bit of sadness, as Joe now reaches across the table to comfort by squeezing my shoulder.   He withdraws his hand quickly as I snap at it, very nearly severing three of his fingers.I slice through bone and tendon and tough cartilage with my wickedly  angled, shark-like incisors, sending bone-bits and glistening black  puddings of coagulated intestinal blood sailing across the diner with\\neach feral bite.A pack of Guatemalan-Indian boys now come into the diner, speaking  Spanish. Or gibberish. Who can tell the difference?They walk over to me and ask me to lift my t-shirt.\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this about?\\u201d Joe wants to know.I lift my shirt and the boys begin scraping along the insides of my  luxurious rolls of corpulent fat with old playing cards. One boy  gently lifts my massive, pendulous moob and collects a big dollop of a yellowish paste  that resembles spoiled soft cheese.\\u201cOh, I\\u2019m just doing my bit to help a downtrodden minority,\\u201d I explain  to Joe as I wipe a turkey drumstick from the corner of my eye. \\u201cA tribe of Peruvian Indians have discovered that the pungent, semi-toxic munge that collects on my unwashed body is a powerful psychedelic drug  of some sort. Ingesting my creamy filth-sweat brings them to death\\u2019s door,  but it assists them in reaching the proper mental state for  dream-quests.\\u201d\\u201cSort of like peyote,\\u201d Joe offers.\\u201cMy munge-cheese kicks peyote\\u2019s ass to hell and back,\\u201d I say with some  degree of pride. \\u201cThey call it La Mantequilla del Diablo \\u2014 The Devil\\u2019s  Butter.\\u201d   The boys end up filling an emptied grout-bucket with my powerful  psychotropic stank-juice. They\\u2019ll be having some powerful dream-quests tonight \\u2014 even with my face covered in cow-meat and at least three live lobsters,   I can smell  that I\\u2019m especially rancid today.   One of the boys tosses a live chicken to me as payment. I snap at it with my  powerful, overdeveloped jaw muscles, bulging and rippling like  those of a sabre-tooth tiger, but the chicken manages a burst of flight and hovers in terror above my flickering, prehensile tongue.\\u201cIt\\u2019s the least I can do to honor our new President\\u2019s call to service,\\u201d I modestly  explain to Joe.\\u201cBut that is the quandary,\\u201d Joe says.   \\u201cTo serve a better power, or to oppose all power on principle alone.\\u201d  \\u201cThese are curious times, Joe, full of strange new feelings and conflicted thoughts,\\u201d I say, or rather that\\u2019s what I attempt to say. My words are garbled and intermixed with guttural grunts as I snap at the elusive chicken which yet manages  to escape my all-ravening maw.\\u201cPatriotism may be the last resort of the scoundrel,\\u201d I console Joe, \\u201cBut it may also be the highest calling of the virtuous.\\u201d   I have now  sprung to my feet in order to seize the escaped chicken. The fat  ripples along my elephantine haunches as I coil to leap, lethal energy  gathered to spring in a frozen moment, like the cocked hammer of a  gun.A really fat gun.\\u201cOscar Wilde said patriotism was the virtue of the vicious,\\u201d Joe counters.But I have no time to riposte in kind, as I leap over the assembled  humanity in the cramped diner, my claws sprung out and shiny-deadly,  my lard-dimpled jowls puffed out like the hood of a cobra.   I beserk about the diner like the Tasmanian Devil, my heaving, snowy-pale he-knockers swinging around the room like whirling Zeppelins of Blunt Force   Trauma.The chicken dodges a slash from one of my stunted fore-limbs, atrophied by disuse in favor of my tyrannosaurine slaughtermaw. It dives  beneath the seat of a six year old boy, a ruddy-cheeked,  haystack-haired, gap-toothed reminder of what this nation is all  about.The boy is inconveniently providing cover for the miscreant fowl, so I  snatch him up with one sweat-drooling meat-paddle and I drop him, alive and screaming, down into my eager throat.My roiling gastric acids will take care of the kid. I\\u2019ve got no time  to chew.The chicken runs.\\u201cLet your brain be your navigator, but your let heart be your pilot,\\u201d I advise Joe as I bite out  the throat of the boy\\u2019s mother, who has, as you might well imagine, sprung to her feet to protest my devouring of her sparkled-eyed tyke.   I slurp her still-pulsating gizzards down my slavering hell-void.The chicken scampers over the well-worn hospital-green tiles of the  ancient diner. It ducks through the doorway and exits to the street as  a truck-driver enters the place.Angry at the clumsiness of the truck driver, I snap at his head with  my yawning pink vortex of saliva-roped doom, severing his head and  neck at the clavicle. His body spews a riotously crimson fountain of  blood at the ceiling, like he were some liquid roman candle.The hot blood splatters on the diner\\u2019s windows and steams.\\u201cBut we are men of intellect, first and foremost,\\u201d Joe calls after me, but I\\u2019m on  the street now, waddling like an aging Sumo wrestler with a wedgie,  my dainty-tiny girlfeet pounding into the cool asphalt like fleshy\\njackhammers.\\u201cBut men of intellect, too, can open their hearts to hope,\\u201d    I advise.I hear the telltale whine of jet-engines\\u2013 F-15\\u2019s, I\\u2019m sure. I\\u2019ve  heard them before. I hear them everytime I go out on one of my rampaging murder-luncheons.I\\u2019ll hear the rumbling of National Guard troop carriers soon enough as  well\\u2013 a platoon of \\u201cmercenaries\\u201d out to chill my right to dissent.   And my right to feed on human flesh.   Even in this so-called \\u201cnew age of freedom.\\u201dPerhaps Joe is right after all.But I have little time to consider that further as I bite the mid-body out of a riot policeman\\u2019s horse. Intestines  ooze and slither out of the gaping wound like wet, grisly Slinkees.The F-15\\u2019s scream down from the sky as they begin their attack run. My debate  with Joe will have to wait.I leap into the cool, slimy waters of the East River as the  air-to-ground missiles slam into the cityscape behind me.The filthy river greets me like an old lover. A murky, green lover  that smells of cabbage, burnt engine oil, and feet. It smells like\\u2026 patriotism.The chicken has escaped.But George Bush did not.   He will bear the terrible wrath of history\\u2019s judgment.   And, if I have anything to do with it, the terrible wrath of a morbidly-obese cannibalistic filmmaker.Midland, Texas is only a few days\\u2019 swim from New York.And anyway, I think some Austin Student Association wants to give me some award.    I don\\u2019t know what for, but they promised to hold the ceremony at Sizzler.Revised and updated; an earlier version was originally posted on  Ace of Spades HQ.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 236794}"
