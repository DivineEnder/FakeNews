"{\"title\": \"Answer This: Erin Burnett\", \"content\": \"Business news anchor Erin Burnett became a familiar face to Americans during her time covering Wall Street for CNBC\\u2019s \\u201cStreet Signs\\u201d and \\u201cSquawk on the Street\\u201d programs. CNN stole her away this year, and last month \\u201cErin Burnett OutFront\\u201d premiered during CNN\\u2019s evening lineup.POLITICO turns the cameras on Burnett for our latest Answer This interview:Tell us your favorite joke.It is more my favorite saying. It is Arabic, and it goes like this: \\u201cOnce a camel gets his nose in the tent, the rest of his body soon will follow.\\u201dWhen\\u2019s the last time you used profanity?For sure within the past hour.How many hours of sleep do you get on average?Five to six.Describe your level of ambition.High. But selective.You\\u2019re president of the United States for enough time to make only one executive decision. What is it?Mandate one year of service for young people \\u2014 whether domestically or overseas. It could be military or other service. Travel and exposure to people who speak other languages, have different values or live in different socioeconomic situations is important to raising open-minded, tolerant citizens.What\\u2019s a common and accepted practice for Americans nowadays that you think we\\u2019ll look back on with regret?Spending time with loved ones on iPads and other PDAs instead of talking. Although \\u2026 maybe this is like the TV was when it took over the living room. Maybe I\\u2019m just getting old.What is your favorite body part on yourself and why?My nose. It is pointy and used to be a sore spot, but now I know: It is what it is. Pointy is all the better to stick in other people\\u2019s business (which is, of course, part of my job).What would you attempt to do if you knew that you could not fail?Fly with my own arms as wings.What type of products do you never go cheap on?Soap.Describe a few pet peeves of yours.None passionately. But they come and go: Right now, about the only exercise I get is walking up the escalators to work, and people who ride the escalators and stand in the middle are problematic.How often do you Google yourself?Rarely. People who have Google alerts send me the things they think I should read.What do you know now that you wish someone had told you 10 years ago?Saving money if you are able isn\\u2019t always the smartest move. Currently our money is worth less every day, so all that sacrifice isn\\u2019t going to buy me as much retirement. Sometimes spending the little extra \\u2014 not borrowing \\u2014 is OK.What childhood event shaped or scarred you most?Impossible to say. One is the time my sister picked me up from piano lessons. She was 19 and on a brief weekend home from college. I used to wait on the porch on the side of the piano teacher\\u2019s house. She pulled up in the car in front of the house \\u2026 just outside my vision (unaware of where I waited). So I waited two hours. I was devastated to lose that time with my big sister. It ate me alive for years. I didn\\u2019t need this experience to know how much I worshiped my sisters, but I still remember losing that time with her and realize how lucky I am to have them.Would you rather \\u2026\\u2026 live without music or live without TV?Without TV.\\u2026 be gossiped about or never talked about at all?Never talked about.Think of one of your least favorite people in Washington and, without naming him or her, describe what makes that person so unappealing.Small-minded and selfish.Let your mother know how much she means to you, in the form of a haiku.Artist, writer, bold / Beautiful like Princess Grace / She said: Fly Iz, Fly\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 96266}"
