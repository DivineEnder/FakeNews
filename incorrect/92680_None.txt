"{\"content\": \"KAILUA, Hawaii \\u2014 President Barack Obama has been stuck in Washington, but that hasn\\u2019t stopped the rest of his family from enjoying their vacation in this small town on the windward coast of Oahu.First lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha have largely been out of the public eye since arriving here on Saturday for what\\u2019s expected to be a 17-day visit.Even while the president\\u2019s been 5,500 miles away - he\\u2019s set to leave for Hawaii on Friday afternoon, the White House announced - it\\u2019s clear that the first family is here for their fourth Christmastime visit since the 2008 election, as Secret Service agents screen visitors to the neighborhood where they\\u2019re staying and shopkeepers boast of their ties to the Obamas.At the same time, there are no signs welcoming the Obamas to town and only a few stores offer Obama memorabilia. Locals and shopkeepers along the main drag on Kailua Road said they hadn\\u2019t seen or heard about the family\\u2019s outings so far this year.But at Island Snow, a shave ice and surf shop further down the road, Michelle, Malia and Sasha had made one visit as of late Thursday, manager Richard Whaley said.\\u201cMichelle and the kids came by the other day,\\u201d he said, checking his schedule book to jog his memory on which day \\u2014 it turned out to be Monday \\u2014 they had visited. \\u201cWe weren\\u2019t expecting it at all. \\u2026 It was really fast \\u2014 they came in some SUVs, Secret Service agents came in with them, they got their shave ice and shot back into the car.\\u201dThough the Obamas visit Island Snow a handful of times during each of their vacations here, Whaley said it never gets old to have them stop by. \\u201cPeople were tripping out,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey were excited to see them, a lot of the Japanese tourists wanted to know what was going on.\\u201dAlso on Monday, the family visited MA\\u2019O Organic Farms with White House chef Sam Kass and ate pizza, according to a tweet by Ed Kenney, a Honolulu chef and board member of the community farm in Wai\\u2019anae. The first lady visited the farm in November, while in Hawaii for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.Privacy is a priority for all presidential families, especially those with young children, and the Obamas are largely protective of Sasha and Malia except on rare occasions when they appear publicly with their father or both parents. At Island Snow, onlookers tried to take pictures with their cell phones, but the Secret Service discouraged them.One place where the family has had privacy here this week is the home where they\\u2019re staying, which has its own private beachfront.The Obamas spent their last three visits at Plantation Estate at Paradise Point, a five-bedroom house on Kailuana Place that rents for $3,500 a night, or $75,000 a month. This year, though, the home\\u2019s owner decided to have his own family there.\", \"source_id\": 1, \"article_id\": 92680, \"title\": \"Michelle, daughters lay low in Hawaii\"}"
