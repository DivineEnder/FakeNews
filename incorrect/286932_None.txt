"{\"title\": \"Alleged McConnell Bugger Shawn Reilly Longtime Dem Operative\", \"content\": \"When is a Democratic Party operative not a Democratic Party operative? When they allegedly tape a meeting of the GOP leader in the Senate, that\\u2019s when. Shawn Reilly, who is being investigated by the FBI for his possible role in illicitly taping a meeting of Mitch McConnell\\u2019s campaign staff, was dismissed by Brad Woodhouse, the communications director at the Democratic National Committee, in this fashion on Megyn Kelly\\u2019s show on Fox:MEGYN KELLY: \\u201cDo you know this group, Progress Kentucky, Brad?\\u201dBRAD WOODHOUSE: \\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201dKELLY: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know anything about them?\\u201dWOODHOUSE: \\u201cI know the brand of progress organizations, but I don\\u2019t know anything about Progress Kentucky.\\u201dKELLY: Do you know Shawn Reilly or Curtis Morrison at all?\\u201dWOODHOUSE: \\u201cUh, no. I\\u2019ve never heard of them.\\u201dLet\\u2019s examine this contemptuous dismissal of Reilly a little more deeply. Reilly was a delegate to the 2012 DNC, and was one of three people who ran field operations for Iraq Summer Campaign, a group that opposed George W. Bush\\u2019s campaign in Iraq, that just so happened to be part of the umbrella group Americans against Escalation in Iraq (whose leader was, you guessed it\\u2013Brad Woodhouse) \\u00a0Reilly was the vice-chairman of the\\u00a0 34th Legislative District in Louisville and is currently the vice-president of the Metro Democratic Club, Louisville\\u2019s largest Democratic Party-affiliated group. And Woodhouse has never heard of him?A month ago, Reilly made national headlines when his group Progress Kentucky made a racially charged comment at McConnell\\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, the former secretary of Labor. Reilly stated:Those tweets did not reflect our values, and we are committed to making sure nothing like that happens again. We also apologize to our many supporters, and all Kentuckians working for change in 2014, for those communications. Comments with references to race, ethnicity or sexual orientation have no place in any debate, and we are deeply embarrassed by such a mistake.And yet Woodhouse has never heard of him?Something is rotten in the state of Kentucky\\u2013and in the DNC.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 286932}"
