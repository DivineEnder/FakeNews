"{\"content\": \"\\nDuring a Wednesday evening House Rules Committee\\u00a0hearing in which pro-amnesty Democrats such as Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) testified, Sessions, the powerful Rules Committee Chairman, said House Republican leaders\\u00a0want to have a \\u201cwell understood agreement about what the law should be and how we as communities, and farm communities, and tech communities, create circumstances where we can have people be in this country and work, and where not one person is quote \\u2018thrown out\\u2019 or \\u2018deported\\u2019 \\u2013\\u00a0where we do keep families together, but what we do is we do so under a rule of law of an understanding.\\u201d\\u00a0Sessions said, \\u201cWe intend to push a bill that would operate under the activity of trying to do under rule of law\\u2026 But that, even in our wildest dream, would not be to remove any person that might be here unless they were dangerous to this country and committed a crime\\u2026 that was never even in a plan that I thought about.\\u201dThe Texas Congressman took offense and said it was \\u201cinflammatory\\u201d that Democrats like Gutierrez are accusing Republicans of wanting to deport 13 million illegal immigrants. \\u201cNo reasonable person in my party\\u2026 has suggested this except the outer-extreme of my party,\\u201d Sessions said. \\u201cAnd on both parties, people have made extreme remarks. There is no one in responsible Republican leadership elected officials [sic] that has said we should deport 13 or 11 million people. That is not what this effort is about, and I find it extremely distasteful that people would come here and suggest things that we have not suggested.\\u201dSessions said that it became \\u201cdramatically\\u201d more difficult to pass an amnesty bill last year when pro-amnesty activists started hectoring and confronting Republicans at their homes or at restaurants. He said he has told the pro-amnesty agitators that, \\u201cwe will appropriately get things done, but that is the wrong way to do it.\\u201dIn the meantime, Sessions said Obama\\u2019s executive amnesty is \\u201cill-advisable, wrong, and not the right thing to do.\\u201d He said Obama \\u201cdid not need to play king,\\u201d and \\u201cthe President of the United States is using this as an excuse for political purposes to make my party \\u2013 [the] Republican party and people \\u2013 look bad.Sessions also emphasized to Gutierrez that he has told him \\u201cnumerous times about what we were trying to do\\u201d and hope the two could work together on a more permanent amnesty bill in the next Congress.\\u00a0\\u201cAnd what I intend to say to you today is, \\u2018My friend, I want to work with you;\\u2019 but I would ask that we please understand that we cannot overplay what we\\u2019re really trying to do, and that is we\\u2019re trying to work through a difficult process,\\u201d Sessions told Gutierrez, noting that \\u201cat least three Texans\\u201d have \\u201cspent a lot of time trying to broker this deal, and everybody knows that, about a year ago, when different changes happened, we fell apart.\\u201d\\u00a0After revealing that House Republican leaders seem intent on giving permanent legal status to nearly every illegal immigrant in the country, Sessions declared that, \\u201cI believe that without rule of law, we have no border; with no border, we have no sovereignty; without sovereignty, we do not have a United States of America.\\u201d\", \"article_id\": 214430, \"title\": \"Congressman Reveals GOP Leaders to Push Amnesty for All But Violent Criminals\", \"source_id\": 2}"
