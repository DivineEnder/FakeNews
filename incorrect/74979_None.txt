Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Monday that they intend to offer a three-year Authorization of the Use of Military Force against the group, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as an amendment to a State Department policy bill, the first bipartisan movement on the matter in months. The effort drew quick praise from the White House and Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, suggesting Kaine and Flake had succeeded in rekindling interest in the stagnant debate.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been deadlocked on war-resolution legislation since President Barack Obama submitted a draft to Capitol Hill in February that was too restrictive for Republicans and too broad for Democrats. With that in mind, Corker (R-Tenn.) has declined to start a war debate that he believes the committee can\\u2019t finish.Now, Kaine and Flake are looking to jump-start discussions by inserting the contentious issue into a Tuesday committee vote on the State Department bill. They propose to limit ground troops in the battle against ISIL unless U.S. citizens are in imminent danger, repeal the 2002 AUMF against Iraq and designate that a 2001 anti-terrorism authorization may not be used to justify attacking the Islamic State, effectively limiting Obama\\u2019s broad latitude with the 14-year old law.A White House spokesperson slammed Republican leaders for failing to take up Obama\\u2019s war draft and noted how closely the bipartisan proposal mirrored Obama\\u2019s own.\\u201cRepublicans in Congress have thus far fallen short of their own commitments to give a new authorization to fight ISIL the serious attention it deserves, and we certainly hope today\\u2019s development represents a turning point,\\u201d the spokesperson said.In announcing their procedural gambit, Flake said it is \\u201cpast time\\u201d for Congress to vote on a war that it has already funded for months while Kaine said the whopping 98-1 support for a controversial nuclear-Iran oversight bill in the Senate indicates that the Foreign Relations panel could find similar agreement on war with Islamic militants.\\u201cI challenge my colleagues to demonstrate the same backbone on the issue of ISIL and finally come together to do what\\u2019s right for our troops and our nation,\\u201d Kaine said.Corker has been reluctant to take up the war debate unless there\\u2019s a clear path for success, contending that a successful vote has little practical application on the battlefield but a failed vote would send the wrong message to U.S. allies. It\\u2019s not clear whether Corker will welcome combining the AUMF with the first State Department authorization since 2002; Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) succeeded in forcing the committee to take up the issue in December during a vote on an unrelated water bill, though the full Senate never voted on it.Despite his bearish view of an AUMF\\u2019s prospects, Corker has refused to rule out a war debate if there\\u2019s a clear way \\u201cto get it across the finish line.\\u201d And he indicated on Monday evening that a path forward still isn\\u2019t completely clear despite the bipartisan breakthrough.\\u201cMany Democrats want to constrain current and future administrations, many Republicans question the administration\\u2019s lack of a coherent strategy, and many on both sides believe the White House already has legal authority to combat ISIS,\\u201d Corker said. \\u201cThe challenge remains that any new AUMF must create enough bipartisan consensus to become law and show that our country is united over the need to confront ISIS.\\u201d\", \"source_id\": 1}"
