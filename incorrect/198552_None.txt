"{\"content\": \"From Jennifer Jacobs writing at the Des Moines Register:\\u00a0Q.\\u00a0Some Iowa conservative women say they appreciate Trump\\u2019s views on immigration, national security and other topics, but they\\u2019re upset about things he says about women. For some, the final straw was when he made fun of your physical appearance, and they\\u2019ve now crossed him off their list of choices for the Iowa caucuses. What are your thoughts on that?A. \\u201cI\\u2019m gratified by these women\\u2019s support. And I\\u2019ve always said character is revealed over time and under pressure. I think a litany of comments about many things reveals character over time and under pressure.\\u201dQ. However, some Trump backers from our Iowa Poll say they just brush off his derogatory comments because \\u201cthat\\u2019s just Donald being Donald.\\u201d\\u00a0They still like him because he\\u2019s fearless, and the world is on fire and they think he\\u2019s the best choice to deal with these problems.A. \\u201cObviously these women are entitled to their opinions. Clearly they are. I think what everyone \\u2014 men and women \\u2014 has to think about: The presidency requires strength. There is no doubt. The presidency also requires character and temperament and judgment and discipline. Men and women ought to be thinking about those things as well.\\u201dQ. Do you think some of the things Trump says about women really are sexist or are these just schoolyard insults?A. \\u201cThis is a person who engages in schoolyard insults to all kinds of people. All kinds of people. It is part of his persona. Some people may like that. They\\u2019re entitled. I find it unpresidential.\\u201dRead the full interview here.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 198552, \"title\": \"Carly Fiorina: Donald Trump's 'Persona' Is 'Unpresidential'\"}"
