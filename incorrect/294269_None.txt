"{\"title\": \"Turkish President: Islamic Terrorists \\u2018Going Straight to Hell\\u2019\", \"source_id\": 2, \"content\": \"Flags are flying at half-mast across Turkey, and the country observed a day of mourning on Wednesday, as Erdogan vowed that Tuesday\\u2019s Islamist attack \\u201cwill not divide or split our country\\u201d and that the government will \\u201cnot let down our people.\\u201dAddressing the Islamic terrorists, Erdogan said that no one who kills dozens of civilians, including women and children, is a true Muslim.\\u201cThis is not Islamic. Taking one person\\u2019s life means going straight to hell,\\u201d he said in Ankara Wednesday, adding, \\u201cNo terrorist organization will come between what we are.\\u201dThe president suggested that the terrorists\\u2019 willingness to bomb during Ramadan reveals their lack of faith, though analysts have claimed that the opposite is true: that Ramadan is the most suitable time to carry out jihad.\\u201cThe attack, which took place during the holy month of Ramadan, shows that terrorism strikes with no regard for faith and values,\\u201d the Turkish President said in a statement.In point of fact, the Islamic State called on Muslims to carry out terror attacks during the month-long Islamic holy season of Ramadan, promising it would be \\u201cthe month of conquest and jihad.\\u201dThe Overseas Security Advisory Council issued a report warning that the threat of Ramadan jihad could be credible precisely because of the religious motivation to sacrifice oneself during this sacred time.\\u201cAccording to Islamic practice, sacrifice during Ramadan can be considered more valuable than that made at other times, so a call to martyrdom during the month may hold a special allure to some,\\u201d the report stated.A growing list of scholars and analysts have pointed to the theological motivation behind the Islamic State\\u2019s terrorist activities, arguing that specifically Muslim principles\\u2014rather than economic or political motivations\\u2014are drawn upon to justify violent jihad.In the past, scholars like Thomas\\u00a0Aquinas\\u00a0and Hilaire\\u00a0Belloc\\u00a0were convinced that the problem for the West did not come from Muslim \\u201cextremists,\\u201d but rather from Islam itself. Belloc famously called Islam \\u201cthe most formidable and persistent enemy\\u201d of Western civilization.As Georgetown University scholar James V. Schall has written, the West must come to grips with the fact that \\u201cIslam, in principle, is actually and potentially violent throughout its entire history.\\u201d Moreover, he wrote, the basic reason for this method \\u201cis obedience to the Law of Allah.\\u201d\\u201cWhat we see now is little different from what has been seen throughout the centuries wherever Islam is found,\\u201d he added.\\u201cThe designated and determined goal of the conquest of the world for Allah has been reinvigorated again and again in world history from the time of Mohammed in the seventh century,\\u201d Schall wrote.\\u201cThese revivals and expansions, which have only been temporarily halted by superior counterforce, have roots in the Qur\\u2019an itself and in its commentaries.\\u201dIn light of the history of Islam, Ramadan is the perfect time to carry out jihad.Follow Thomas D.
