When it comes to political issues, Mangold is no shrinking violet, like so many Republican pro athletes, who tend to stay underground.Not a fan of PETA, an animal rights organization that has also killed myriad dogs and cats, Mangold has taunted them on twitter when consuming a steak.\\u201cAnd PETA would have cried with what I ate tonight. So much so they gave me a huge chili in honor of the damage that I did to the animals,\\u201d Mangold tweeted on April 21, 2010. On March 3, 2011 Mangold tweeted, \\u201cThank you PETA for inspiring this family dinner.\\u201dWhile Mangold hasn\\u2019t officially endorsed Trump, clearly he\\u2019s a big fan of the candidate.In writing about Mangold\\u2019s appearance with Trump, Darryl Slater, a sports-writer for the left-leaning Newark Star-Ledger, wrote, \\u201cHis public support of Trump comes after [Chris] Christie endorsed Trump, who has run a controversial and polarizing campaign.\\u201dIt\\u2019s unclear if the writer considers Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, or Barack Obama \\u201ccontroversial and polarizing.\\u201d\\nBut based on his employer, perhaps not.\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 297723}"
