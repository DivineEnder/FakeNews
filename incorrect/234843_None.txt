"{\"title\": \"Did Gay Marriage Fraudster Fake Another Paper?\", \"content\": \"In recent days it has come to light that LaCour likely faked data related to an explosive survey he claims to have conducted of same-sex marriage opponents in California. The paper, published in the presitigious journal Sciecne, has since been removed.George Mason University Professor Tim Groseclose became suspicious when he was asked to examine another LaCour paper, \\u201cThe Echo Chambers are Empty: Direct Evidence of Balanced, Not Biased Exposure to Mass Media.\\u201d This \\u201cunpublished working paper\\u201d examines the news \\u201cdiet\\u201d of Democrats and Republicans and concludes, according to Groseclose, \\u201cvoters do not, primarily, get their news from \\u2018echo chambers\\u2019.\\u201dWhat LaCour claimed to have done is to compare buzz phrases \\u2014 \\u201cdeath tax\\u201d vs. \\u201cestate tax\\u201d \\u2014 used by Congressional Democrats and Republicans and then compared the frequency of use across various media outlets.On a post at the website Ricochet Groseclose goes into detail about why he was almost certain LaCour had faked this study. Much of it is so complicated that the average graduate student in the field of political science would not understand it. And this is where LaCour may have gotten into trouble. Groseclose says LaCour didn\\u2019t understand the statistical models he was cribbing from. In fact, according to Groseclose, LaCour did a cut and paste job of someone else\\u2019s work in explaining his statistical modeling.What\\u2019s more, it appears that LaCour cribbed some of his data from Groseclose\\u2019s own data file, which Groseclose had provided to him a few years ago. This would not have been a problem except that LaCour said he was using a different data set.As Groseclose explained to Breitbart News, \\u201cThe problem is that his paper claims to estimate results from other data (loaded-phrase data), whereas the code he writes seems to use my data.\\u00a0 This means that he couldn\\u2019t have used that code to derive the results that he reports.\\u00a0 Either he sent Martin the wrong code or, what I think actually happened, he simply faked the results he reports then when Martin asked him for code he sent the closest substitute he could find (which I believe came from a homework problem one of his professors wrote).\\u201dEmory University\\u2019s Gregory J. Martin published a brief paper on May 29\\u00a0arriving at the same conclusions as Groseclose. Martin wanted to replicate LaCour\\u2019s conclusions and requested LaCour\\u2019s data set and after trying and failing to run it concluded, \\u201cSimply put, despite using the same dataset of news show transcripts and implementing the same method described in his paper my results were not at all comparable to LaCour\\u2019s.\\u201dMartin says LaCour\\u2019s results \\u201care very likely fabricated.\\u201dBesides the highly technical and nearly indecipherable methods of statistical measurement and analysis that LaCour got wrong, he also made some glaring errors. For instance, he claims to have used the \\u201cUCLA Closed Caption (LACC) archive of news show transcripts.\\u201d However, for the year he claimed to have measured, 28 of 60 shows were not even the UCLA database.Groseclose considers this the biggest scandal ever to hit the field of political science, and he thinks more scandal are coming and for the same reason LaCour got caught. The methods are simply too complicated even for many graduate students to understand.He says, \\u201cOver the past five or ten years I have have noticed more and more papers written by young political scientists (grad students and assistant professors) that claim to use extremely fancy and complex statistical techniques, yet the authors do not seem to fully understand the techniques they claim to use. Their descriptions of their statistical methods are often as opaque as the LaCour index I discuss above.\\u201dHe says within political science there are probably about half a dozen additional Michael LaCours \\u2014 researchers who are perceived to be solid and talented scholars yet have build that perception partly upon faked results.\\u201dGroseclose predicts that LaCour will not be awarded a Ph.D. from UCLA and his job offer from Princeton, set to begin this summer, will be withdrawn.\\u00a0Follow Austin Ruse on Twitter @austinruse\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 234843}"
