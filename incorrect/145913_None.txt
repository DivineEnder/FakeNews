A justice ministry spokesman said they may run next week as well and that Norway was considering doing the same in other countries.One of the largest groups of asylum seekers are Afghans.

Do not put faith in false promises by smugglers or social media!\\u201d\\u201cThe Belgian government can and will refuse to decide your asylum claim when fingerprints are registered in another European member state\\u2026\\u00a0A rejection of your asylum claim will result in an order to leave the country within 30 days. If you don\\u2019t leave voluntarily, then Belgium will return you by force to Kabul\\u201d.The media campaigns by Norway and Belgium follow a similar initiative by Denmark in September, advertising changed in migration rules as a means to deter attempts to claim asylum. Printed in a number of foreign newspapers including titles in Turkey and the Lebanon, the advert informed migrants that the benefits they could claim in the country had been halved by the new government, and receiving the money depended on them taking Danish lessons and integrating into society.Reuters Contributed To This Report\\u00a0\", \"source_id\": 2, \"article_id\": 145913}"
