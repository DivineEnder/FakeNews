Sean Spicer was dressed as a rabbit for the white house easter egg roll, not an easter bunny. FBI director James Comey reported last night that the fur on the costume was too short to be classified as a bunny. "short fur revealed that mr spicer was dressed, in fact, as the easter rabbit." Comey stated in his report. Sean spicer refused to give comment.
